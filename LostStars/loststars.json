It’s a sound older than time itself, echoing through the fabric of reality.\n\nHer body goes rigid, and her mind struggles to hold onto its sense of self. The scream intensifies, seeping deeper into her consciousness, like a distortion in the world that’s about to consume everything. But before she can process what’s happening, the world flickers and the adventure abruptly cuts off, leaving only the fading echo of that maddening sound.\n\nThe screen goes black.\n[[...]]",

      "text": "The man pauses, looking at you with a mixture of amusement and pity, as if your ignorance were an old, familiar friend. “Ah, it’s not exactly ‘news’ in the traditional sense. More like... an inevitability. You’re standing in a very peculiar part of space, one that doesn’t quite obey the rules of physics or time. This region, the one you thought was just some forgotten patch of the universe... it’s the Great Attractor.”\n\nYou blink, the name like a sharp sting against the back of your skull. “The Great Attractor? What does that even mean?”\n\nThe woman, who had been silent up until now, steps forward, her gaze unsettlingly calm. “It’s a force, Em, one you can’t quite perceive unless you’ve been... touched by it. It’s a point in space that seems to draw everything in its vicinity toward it, bending the very fabric of reality around it. Galaxies, stars, even time and space—they all bend, warping and collapsing in its wake.”\n\n“But... why here? Why us?” you ask, your breath catching as a sense of dread begins to creep up your spine.\n\nThe man shakes his head slowly. “You’re not just in the Great Attractor’s gravitational pull. You’re standing on the edge of something much worse.” His words hang in the air, heavy, like the weight of a door that’s about to open to something you can’t turn back from.\n\n“Think of it like this,” the woman says, her voice dropping to a whisper, “The Great Attractor doesn’t just bend space. It feeds on it. It devours the moments, the experiences, the lives of those unfortunate enough to fall into its orbit. It is a demon of the desert—an entity that has no mercy, no understanding. It takes, but it doesn’t give back.”\n\nYour stomach twists. The idea of a cosmic force, a silent, hungry beast that devours all that it touches, seems too unfathomable, too vast. But the more you hear, the more the air around you seems to press in, as though reality itself is suffocating under the weight of this revelation.\n\n“This region of space,\" the man continues, “has been marked by the Great Attractor for eons. It’s not a place of exploration or wonder. It’s the edge of an abyss—a place where time, reality, and identity collapse into an endless void. That’s why so many end up here, lost... consumed.”\n\nThe woman pauses, her eyes narrowing, almost pityingly, as she looks at you. “You’re not just lost in space, Em. You’re lost in something much darker. You’ve already felt its pull. That disorientation you’ve experienced? That confusion? It’s the Attractor playing with your perception. And it’s just the beginning.”\n\nSuddenly, a cold shiver crawls up your spine. You can almost feel the Attractor’s presence now—not just as a force of physics, but as something far older, far more malevolent. A consciousness, a primal scream from beyond the edges of space and time, echoing across your very being.\n\n“It’s not just a cosmic anomaly,” you murmur, the realization creeping into your mind. “It’s alive... it’s waiting...”\n\nThe woman nods solemnly, her voice barely above a whisper. “The Great Attractor is not just a thing. It’s a demon. A desert god. A void that thrives on the very essence of reality itself. And it has claimed this region, bound it to its will. Whatever you’ve experienced out here—those strange, fractured realities? They are its doing. Its hunger, reaching out across dimensions, pulling everything into its maw.”\n\nAnd as you stand there, staring into the infinite void, the strangest thought strikes you—the Great Attractor has always been here. Watching. Watching.Watching.. It knew you’d come.\n\nAnd then, as the ship disappears into the void, the last thing you hear is the distant, hollow scream of a being that has never known mercy, calling you into the black, endless desert.\n[[Realize the scream]]",
