As you walk through the streets, you notice a number of stray cats darting around, seemingly everywhere. Bubba chuckles, noticing the confusion in your eyes. 'What's the deal with cats?' you ask. Bubba shrugs, 'They’re tricky, always doing their own thing. You’ll figure it out.' But you’re not sure how to approach these mysterious creatures.",
