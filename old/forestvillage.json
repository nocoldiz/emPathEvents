The village healer believes that a rare herb deep within the forest could save her, but the herb is fiercely guarded by a mystical beast that has terrorized the region for years. As you consider your options, the villagers plead for your help, willing to offer anything to save Lila. Bubba gives you a knowing look, sensing the gravity of the choice ahead.",
