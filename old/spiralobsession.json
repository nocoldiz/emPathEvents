At first, it’s just a fleeting thought, but the more you look, the more you notice them everywhere. Spirals. In the architecture, in nature, in the clouds, even in the way people move. You can’t shake the feeling that they’re calling to you, drawing you in. You try to brush it off, but it lingers, gnawing at the edge of your mind. The more you try to ignore it, the stronger the obsession becomes.",
