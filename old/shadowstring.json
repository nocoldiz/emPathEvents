He speaks at last, words sharp like splinters in the stale air: 'I think I must try to find Eris once more.' His eyes carry the reflection of vast distances, glistening with something feral and raw. Eris, Discordia herself, left him scarred as if from within, her laughter a rasp echoing in both of you. And yet, here he is—seeking to court the fracture once again.",
