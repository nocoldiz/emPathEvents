You can feel a strange energy radiating from it, as if something important lies inside. The lock doesn’t seem to have a keyhole, only a complex series of symbols. There’s a small plaque beneath it with a riddle: 'To unlock the chest, seek the balance between time, water, and fire.'",

After a few moments, you find a small, almost imperceptible button hidden in the carvings. Pressing it, you hear a soft click, but nothing seems to happen. It seems the chest is still locked tight, but there’s a faint glow around the lock now, hinting at some deeper magic.",

As you ponder, a faint warmth emanates from the carvings on the lock. You recall an old trick: perhaps the symbols represent the need to align certain elements.
