      "description": "You stand at the entrance of a long-forgotten industrial temple, once a place of worship and manufacturing, now a crumbling relic of the past. The air is thick with dust, and the smell of rust and oil lingers in the dampness. The large stone doors, adorned with faded engravings, creak as you push them open. Inside, shadows move and echoes bounce off the walls. Machinery once powered by ancient rituals now stands silent, overgrown with vines and decay. Your task is simple: explore, gather what you can, and uncover the temple's lost history. But something feels off.",

At the center of the temple lies a massive altar, engraved with symbols you can’t recognize. There’s a faint hum from a deep, mechanical source. The air seems to vibrate with an unsettling energy. On the altar, you find what appears to be a journal, worn and old. It might hold the key to understanding this place.",

The rituals involved powering the machinery with human devotion, transferring energy from the human soul into the mechanical systems. But the journal also mentions that something went wrong: the temple’s power source became unstable, and the workers and priests were trapped, their spirits bound to the machinery. The last entry warns that the energy is still alive in the temple, and if disturbed, it could awaken something dangerous.",
