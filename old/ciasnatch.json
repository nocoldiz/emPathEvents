You rub your eyes and stretch, feeling the cool air hit your skin. You step outside the camper, but Bubba is nowhere to be found. His usual spot by the fire is empty, and the fire’s smoldering remains give no sign of him. Panic starts to rise as you hear distant voices—faint, but unmistakable. They're not familiar. Then you notice something else: the tire tracks near the camper.",
