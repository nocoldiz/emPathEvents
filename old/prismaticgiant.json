Floating high above, a massive prismatic entity radiates pure white rays, casting hues across the land. The light is overwhelming, and as the camper moves through it, you feel a sudden, strange sensation. The ground beneath you seems to grow distant, and you realize with horror that you’re shrinking. In moments, you’re no bigger than an ant, and the world around you is now a vast and terrifying landscape.",
