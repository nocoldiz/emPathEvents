The camper shakes violently, and the landscape outside blurs into a swirling vortex. After what feels like an eternity, everything goes still. You find yourself in the quiet expanse of space, far from any familiar stars.

Hours pass in the silence of space. Just when hope seems lost, a bright light appears from nowhere—a ship unlike anything you’ve seen, sleek and shimmering with alien tech. It hails you telepathically, asking if you need assistance.

But the crystals&#39; extraction process triggers a strange, low hum from the asteroid.

Through their telepathic communication, they express a deep curiosity about Earth and its inhabitants, their knowledge of biology far beyond human comprehension. They make it clear that their interest lies in the genetic diversity of humans, and in exchange for a sample, they’ll assist in bringing you back to your home planet.

Reluctantly, you agree. &quot;Fine,&quot; you say, &quot;but be careful with it. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re going to do with it, but I&#39;ll trust you.&quot;

The beings send a wave of gratitude through your mind, their understanding of your biology growing clearer with each passing second. They study your body in intricate detail, mapping your DNA and analyzing the various components of your human form. The process is surreal, as if you’re connected to them on a level beyond the physical, your mind intertwined with theirs.

Once the sample is collected, they gently set you back down on the floor of their ship. Without warning, they place their hands on your temples and you feel a strange shift. A warmth floods your senses, and the sensation of floating begins to fade.

As they release you, the beings convey an image of Earth—its blue oceans and sprawling continents—vivid and clear in your mind. The ship hums and vibrates gently, its alien technology humming to life as a portal opens before you. Through the shimmering threshold, you see the familiar sight of your camper parked near a forest clearing.

&quot;Your world,&quot; one of the aliens communicates in your mind, &quot;has many wonders. We now understand your biology... and we will return you home.&quot;

With a soft, almost musical hum, the ship drops you and your camper onto solid ground, your feet back on the soil of Earth. The portal fades, and you’re left standing in the quiet, familiar woods. Bubba, who had been anxiously pacing outside, looks up in shock as you reappear.

&quot;Well,&quot; Bubba says, glancing at the now-vanishing alien ship, &quot;that was one wild ride.&quot;

You shake your head in disbelief, trying to process everything. But one thing is clear: the aliens now understand the complexity of human life, and thanks to your help, they’ve gained insights that might shape their future encounters with Earth.

As the camper hums to life, you feel a strange sense of connection to the stars. The universe, it seems, is much bigger than you ever imagined.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Signal ship" tags="" position="1525,750" size="100,100">The human-made ship responds and agrees to guide you to the nearest station.

[[End -&gt;Return home]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Observe ship" tags="" position="1600,575" size="100,100">The hum of the ship grows louder, and soon, it hovers just within reach of your camper. It’s sleek, almost clinical in design, like something out of a futuristic dream. A hatch opens with a soft hiss, and a group of figures step out, their suits a strange combination of high-tech armor and mundane everyday wear. They glance around, taking in the surroundings with the sharp eyes of experienced travelers.

&quot;Didn&#39;t expect to find anyone out here,&quot; one of them says, his voice surprisingly calm, like he’s making casual conversation.

You step forward, wariness making you pause before you speak. “What is this? Who are you?”

The man tilts his head, blinking slowly as though considering the question. “Oh, right. You haven’t heard, have you? About the news?”

“News?” You ask, confusion creeping into your voice. “What news?”
[[Ask for delucidations]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Take artifact" tags="" position="1337.5,875" size="100,100">You carefully reach out and grasp the pulsating artifact. The moment your fingers touch it, a strange warmth spreads through your hand, and you feel an odd hum reverberating up your arm. The device is small, about the size of a marble, and it’s made of a smooth, metallic substance that seems to shimmer with an iridescent glow. As you hold it, the intricate patterns carved into its surface seem to shift and change, as if they are alive.

But before you can fully examine it, the artifact begins to react. Its glow intensifies, and with a sudden, sharp pulse, it contracts, shrinking down to the size of a pebble in your hand. The hum grows louder, a high-pitched frequency that almost makes your ears ring. Then, just as quickly as it shrank, it vanishes from your grasp in a flash of light, leaving your hand empty.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Activate portal" tags="" position="487.5,950" size="100,100">Em’s fingers hover over the ancient console, her heart racing as she attempts to initiate the unstable portal. The machine hums to life with a violent shudder, the air around her vibrating with energy. Suddenly, a burst of light erupts from the console, and the portal swirls open with a thunderous roar.

Just as she’s about to step through, the light flickers and distorts. A message flashes across the screen: Warning: Temporal Distortion Detected. Before she can react, a shadowy figure steps through the portal, its form distorted and flickering like a broken hologram. It locks eyes with her, its voice eerily familiar.

&quot;You shouldn’t have done that,&quot; the figure says, its voice hollow and strained. &quot;The portal wasn’t meant to bring you here…&quot;

Em stares in shock as the figure steps forward, revealing a version of herself, distorted and twisted, wearing a dark, tattered version of her witch robes. The figure smiles coldly, and as it raises its hand, the world around Em begins to unravel, the walls of the outpost flickering in and out of existence.

&quot;You&#39;ve just opened the door to your own destruction,&quot; the twisted version of herself says, and the portal begins to collapse, dragging her in with it.
[[id:selfbossfight-&gt;Face yourself]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Leave outpost" tags="" position="612.5,950" size="100,100">Em steps back from the console, her mind buzzing with the implications of what she’s just learned. The outpost, built by travelers from another dimension, was more than just a base—it was a staging ground for experiments with portals, a link to countless other worlds.

As she begins to gather her things, she notices a small, hidden compartment in the wall. Curiosity piqued, she opens it and finds a small, metallic object—a device that seems to pulse with an otherworldly energy. She doesn’t recognize it, but it feels important, like it was left specifically for her to find.

As she picks it up, the device activates, projecting a holographic map of interconnected dimensions. The last dot on the map blinks ominously, a line leading directly to Earth. But there’s something strange about it: the map’s path doesn&#39;t just lead to Earth—it points to a time before her own existence, a place in history that’s been erased from all records.

The map&#39;s final message appears: “The time loop has already begun. You are the key.”

Em stares at the projection, realization dawning on her. The portal wasn’t just a way to travel between dimensions—it was a way to rewrite time itself. But what does it mean for her, and why is she the one chosen to close the loop?

The device flickers off in her hands, leaving her with more questions than answers—and a chilling feeling that she&#39;s just scratched the surface of something far larger and far older than she ever imagined.
[[Go back to your travels]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Disarm alarm" tags="" position="700,1100" size="100,100">Em rushes to the central control panel, her heart pounding as the blaring alarm echoes through the outpost. She scans the console, frantically pressing buttons and trying to read the unfamiliar symbols. Her breath comes in short bursts as she frantically searches for a way to stop the countdown. The screen flickers, showing a series of error messages and corrupted data, each more cryptic than the last.

&quot;Come on, come on!&quot; she mutters, trying to force the machine to cooperate.

As the seconds tick down, she pulls a lever in desperation. The alarm cuts out for a brief moment—just enough time for Em to think she’s succeeded. But before she can catch her breath, the console flashes a final message: &quot;Self-Destruct Engaged. Fail-safe override unavailable.&quot;

A sudden, low hum fills the room as the walls begin to shake, the countdown continuing without mercy.

Defeated, Em watches as the screen flashes one last, cryptic phrase before the entire system shuts down. &quot;Warning: Entity approaching from the Psychosphere. Initiating feedback loop.&quot;

A sudden, overwhelming sensation fills Em’s mind. It’s as though the very air around her is thickening, her vision blurring, and her thoughts being pulled in every direction at once. She hears it—a primal scream, raw and piercing, reverberating through the psychosphere. It’s not her scream. It’s not anyone’s. It’s a sound older than time itself, echoing through the fabric of reality.

Her body goes rigid, and her mind struggles to hold onto its sense of self. The scream intensifies, seeping deeper into her consciousness, like a distortion in the world that’s about to consume everything. But before she can process what’s happening, the world flickers and the adventure abruptly cuts off, leaving only the fading echo of that maddening sound.

The screen goes black.

More like... an inevitability. You’re standing in a very peculiar part of space, one that doesn’t quite obey the rules of physics or time. This region, the one you thought was just some forgotten patch of the universe... it’s the Great Attractor.”

You blink, the name like a sharp sting against the back of your skull. “The Great Attractor? What does that even mean?”

The woman, who had been silent up until now, steps forward, her gaze unsettlingly calm. “It’s a force, Em, one you can’t quite perceive unless you’ve been... touched by it. It’s a point in space that seems to draw everything in its vicinity toward it, bending the very fabric of reality around it. Galaxies, stars, even time and space—they all bend, warping and collapsing in its wake.”

“But... why here? Why us?” you ask, your breath catching as a sense of dread begins to creep up your spine.

The man shakes his head slowly. “You’re not just in the Great Attractor’s gravitational pull. You’re standing on the edge of something much worse.” His words hang in the air, heavy, like the weight of a door that’s about to open to something you can’t turn back from.

“Think of it like this,” the woman says, her voice dropping to a whisper, “The Great Attractor doesn’t just bend space. It feeds on it. It devours the moments, the experiences, the lives of those unfortunate enough to fall into its orbit. It is a demon of the desert—an entity that has no mercy, no understanding. It takes, but it doesn’t give back.”

Your stomach twists. The idea of a cosmic force, a silent, hungry beast that devours all that it touches, seems too unfathomable, too vast. But the more you hear, the more the air around you seems to press in, as though reality itself is suffocating under the weight of this revelation.

“This region of space,&quot; the man continues, “has been marked by the Great Attractor for eons. It’s not a place of exploration or wonder. It’s the edge of an abyss—a place where time, reality, and identity collapse into an endless void. That’s why so many end up here, lost... consumed.”

The woman pauses, her eyes narrowing, almost pityingly, as she looks at you. “You’re not just lost in space, Em. You’re lost in something much darker. You’ve already felt its pull. That disorientation you’ve experienced? That confusion? It’s the Attractor playing with your perception. And it’s just the beginning.”

Suddenly, a cold shiver crawls up your spine. You can almost feel the Attractor’s presence now—not just as a force of physics, but as something far older, far more malevolent. A consciousness, a primal scream from beyond the edges of space and time, echoing across your very being.

“It’s not just a cosmic anomaly,” you murmur, the realization creeping into your mind. “It’s alive... it’s waiting...”

The woman nods solemnly, her voice barely above a whisper. “The Great Attractor is not just a thing. It’s a demon. A desert god. A void that thrives on the very essence of reality itself. And it has claimed this region, bound it to its will. Whatever you’ve experienced out here—those strange, fractured realities? They are its doing. Its hunger, reaching out across dimensions, pulling everything into its maw.”

And as you stand there, staring into the infinite void, the strangest thought strikes you—the Great Attractor has always been here. Watching. Watching.Watching.. It knew you’d come.

And then, as the ship disappears into the void, the last thing you hear is the distant, hollow scream of a being that has never known mercy, calling you into the black, endless desert.

That night, the kitten curls up next to you in bed. As you drift off, the dream is strange—its glowing eyes and soft purring fill your mind, and though it doesn’t speak, you feel as if it’s trying to communicate.

You wake in the night to find the kitten staring out the window, eyes wide and glowing faintly. It meows softly, a sound that resonates deep in your chest, as if echoing across dimensions.

Em explains the odd sensations to Bubba. He nods understandingly, looking at the bottle with suspicion. &quot;That water might be… tainted. I’ll help you through it,&quot; he says calmly.

Bubba starts talking to Em, his voice a steady anchor in a sea of colors and shapes. &quot;Remember, it’s all just in your mind. Focus on my voice,&quot; he says.

Em attempts to ground herself by focusing on her surroundings, but the more she looks, the more things seem to come alive. The walls breathe, and patterns dance around her.

The colors swirl in ways that make no sense, yet they’re oddly amusing. She shares the moment with Bubba, who chuckles beside her, his familiar voice grounding her in the madness. His easy laughter is like a tether, pulling her back when the intensity of the visions starts to get too much. She feels a warmth in his presence, like a steady hand in a storm. With Bubba by her side, the hallucinations become less intimidating and more like a strange, shared joke between old friends.

The vibrant swirl of colors begins to lose its intensity, the edges of the shapes softening, and the sound of her own breathing becomes more distinct against the surreal backdrop. As she exhales slowly, the overwhelming rush of sensations starts to fade. The world around her, once pulsating and chaotic, becomes more defined and calm. She feels her mind slowly clearing, the haze lifting.

The colors around her are still swirling wildly, and the shapes seem to shift in ways that don’t make sense. She glances over at Bubba, wondering if he’s experiencing the same bizarre hallucinations.

“Bubba,” she says with a light laugh, “Are you seeing this too, or am I losing my mind here?”

Bubba looks at her with a raised eyebrow, then surveys the kaleidoscope of shapes and patterns in the air. He scratches his chin thoughtfully, the corners of his mouth twitching as if he’s trying to decide if he’s playing along or genuinely unsure.

“You’re not alone, Em,” Bubba says with a grin, his voice calm and steady. “I see it too. But I gotta say, I think this is one of the more colorful trips we&#39;ve had.&quot;

Em laughs again, the tension in her chest easing as Bubba’s casual response helps to ground her even more. The strange sensations aren’t so overwhelming now, and she feels a little less lost in the whirlwind of colors and shapes.

Bubba looks around, clearly intrigued, but also a little unnerved. &#39;I’ve seen some weird places, Em, but this… this takes the cake.&#39;
You nod, scanning the shelves. There are strange trinkets and peculiar items everywhere: old lanterns that seem to flicker with no flame, jars filled with shimmering dust, and books with spines that seem to change when you’re not looking.
&#39;Let’s set up camp,&#39; you say, deciding it might be best to rest for a bit and figure out what’s going on. You pull out your tent, and Bubba starts gathering firewood, though there’s no telling where it’s coming from.

The aisles continue endlessly in all directions, and the walls now seem to be made of a shifting, liquid-like material that reflects odd colors. The air is thick and oppressive, and the atmosphere feels increasingly unnatural.

&quot;Uh, Em, I’m getting a bad feeling about this,&quot; Bubba says, stepping closer to you, his voice tight with unease. &quot;We’ve gotta get out of here.&quot;

You turn to look around, but everything looks the same—strange and alien, and now even more distorted. The walls pulse as if alive. Every movement you make echoes unnervingly through the space.

You close your eyes, trying to recall what you know about places like this—ancient stores that aren’t supposed to exist, appearing in forgotten corners of the world, sometimes in dreams, sometimes in legends.

Your mind wanders back to old stories you’ve heard over the years—tales of wandering merchants who spoke of selling goods in places that shifted between dimensions. Of stores that existed in both the past and the future, in places that had no real physical location but rather were built upon an ever-changing landscape of time itself. You remember one story in particular: a store built atop the ruins of an ancient temple, its shelves filled with items that seemed to rewrite reality with every touch. In this store, things you bought would change with you; they would grow or decay depending on your own state of mind. But the most chilling part of the story was always the same—no one ever left the store in the same way they entered.

The weight of the legend feels like a veil settling over your thoughts. The more you think, the more it becomes clear that this place is part of a much older network—a system of stores scattered across forgotten dimensions, some of which might have been abandoned, and others that still pulse with energy.

As you gather your thoughts, Bubba looks at you quizzically. “You okay, Em?”

You nod, but you don’t feel entirely sure. This place feels too familiar now. The ancient stories weren&#39;t just stories after all. They were warnings.

Suddenly, the store’s walls shift and warp around you, as if responding to your thoughts. It’s unsettling, but you can’t help but feel that you&#39;re on the brink of understanding something vast and incomprehensible.

Perhaps there’s a way to find an exit. Or perhaps there’s something else you&#39;re meant to uncover here.

[[Explore deeper to see if the walls reveal more clues.-&gt;Shelves]]

There’s no sign of life—no people, no creatures, no movement except for the shifting aisles. The idea of being completely alone in this strange, unchanging place makes your skin crawl.

Bubba watches you, his brow furrowed with concern. “You think someone’s here? Or are we just stuck with the walls for company?”

“Well, there might be someone,” you reply, thinking that maybe there’s some hidden figure, some entity that knows the way out—or at least has answers about this place. If anything, you need some sort of contact to ground yourself.

You clear your throat and call out, “Hello? Is anyone here?”

Your voice echoes, the sound unnervingly loud in the silent space. For a moment, nothing happens. Then, faintly, you hear something—a low, almost imperceptible murmur that seems to come from deep within the aisles.

Bubba’s eyes widen. “You heard that too, right?”

You nod. The murmur turns into a soft, rhythmic sound, like a chant or a melody, distant and muffled but unmistakable. It seems to be coming from deeper within the store. Something—or someone—is responding.

With a cautious glance at Bubba, you decide to investigate the source of the sound. You follow the trail, your heart pounding in your chest as you step deeper into the store’s endless aisles. As you move, the walls seem to ripple with the sound, like they’re alive, echoing back your every step.

The chanting grows louder, and soon, you find yourself at the edge of a strange, glowing circle etched into the floor, surrounded by ancient symbols. In the center of the circle stands a figure—a cloaked individual, too indistinct to make out fully, who seems to be the source of the strange hum that has filled the air.

The figure doesn’t speak but raises one hand, gesturing for you to come closer. Something about the figure feels strangely familiar, as though you’ve encountered them before—or maybe you will in some future time.

Your curiosity piqued, you step forward, prepared for whatever answers they may hold.

They pulse faintly with light, like they’re alive. As you run your fingers over the symbols, the air around you vibrates.
&#39;What are these?&#39; you wonder aloud, but Bubba shrugs, clearly unsettled.

You turn around and walk back toward the tent, but as you do, the aisles around you begin to twist. The shelves shift, making it harder to find your way back.
The eerie silence returns, and you start to feel as though the store is mocking you, shifting just out of reach every time you think you’re near the tent.
&#39;Maybe this was a mistake,&#39; Bubba mutters, having somehow reappeared behind you. &#39;We’re trapped, Em.&#39;
The aisles stretch into infinity, and you realize that the way out might not exist at all.

The images flicker quickly, never staying long enough for you to fully understand them.
Bubba taps you on the shoulder. &#39;We need to figure this out, Em. Maybe these walls are showing us where we are.&#39;

It takes a few moments of intense concentration, but you finally start to make out the flow of the magic. These symbols are part of an ancient spell, a ward of protection, but it’s corrupted. Instead of shielding, it seems to be trying to draw power from the environment around it.

With your newfound understanding, you carefully begin the process of unweaving the magic. The symbols lose their glow, the vibration in the air ceases, and the shelf’s strange aura fades.

“Done,” you say, wiping a bead of sweat from your brow. “It was feeding on ambient magic.”
Bubba looks relieved, but you can’t shake the feeling that something darker still lurks in the corners of this place.
[[Check the shelf]]
[[Keep investigating the symbols -&gt;Investigate the symbols]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Use your knowledge of languages to crack it" tags="" position="675,900" size="100,100">You take a step back and examine the symbols more critically. These aren’t just magical runes—they appear to be part of a complex code. Your mind begins to churn through the possibilities, trying to decipher their meaning. You recognize some of the shapes as old language patterns, likely of a lost civilization.

After a few moments, you manage to piece the symbols together. It seems to be a cryptic message:
&quot;Only the blood of the forgotten will open the gate.&quot;

As the realization hits, the symbols on the shelf glow brighter for a moment. Suddenly, you hear a creaking sound from the back of the room, followed by the distinct shifting of stone. The shelf slides forward, revealing a hidden compartment in the wall. Inside lies a small chest.

Bubba steps forward, cautiously. &quot;Is this... what it meant?&quot; he asks, his voice tinged with awe.
[[Open che chest]]

The patterns seem familiar; these are wards, but they aren’t the usual protective runes you would expect. Instead, these seem like warnings, perhaps to ward off an intrusion or prevent something from escaping.

As you trace the symbols, a ripple of cold air sweeps through the room. The markings seem to be reacting to your touch, like they’re aware of your presence. With a shiver down your spine, you pull your hand away, but not before you notice something strange: the symbols have changed. They&#39;ve begun to glow a dark crimson hue, pulsating with an ominous rhythm.

&quot;What did you do?&quot; Bubba asks, backing away. &quot;I think we’ve just triggered something.”

Suddenly, the ground trembles. A low rumble echoes from deeper within the facility. You feel an overwhelming sensation of danger—a dark force has been awakened.

[[id: darkforce-&gt;Face the dark force]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Step into the light" tags="" position="950,825" size="100,100">You take a deep breath and step into the glowing light. The world around you warps, and you feel a strange, weightless sensation. You try to take a step forward, but the light engulfs you entirely. For a moment, everything goes dark.
When you open your eyes, you find yourself standing in a completely different place—still inside the store, but it looks different. The shelves are more chaotic, and the aisles twist at strange angles. Bubba is gone.
&#39;What happened?&#39; you whisper to yourself.
Suddenly, the light flickers, revealing a hidden door in the distance. You can’t help but feel that it’s your way out.
[[Open the door]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Call out to the light" tags="" position="1150,775" size="100,100">You call out to the light, your voice echoing through the aisles. The light pulses brighter for a moment, and you think you hear a faint voice answer, but it’s impossible to make out the words.
Suddenly, the light shifts, forming a figure—an ancient being that seems to be made of pure light. It steps forward, speaking in a language you don’t understand, but you feel the words in your chest as though they’re being spoken directly to your heart.
[[Step into the light]] 
[[Turn back toward the tent]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Try to communicate with the walls" tags="" position="1100,325" size="100,100">You place your hand against the pulsating walls, feeling the energy vibrate through your fingertips. The walls respond to your touch, shifting slightly and revealing a series of glowing symbols. The strange energy surges, and a voice, soft and distant, seems to speak directly into your mind.
&quot;You seek answers, but they are not for you.&quot;
The walls start to hum louder, and you feel yourself being drawn into them, as if the space is swallowing you whole. For a moment, the world around you fades to black.
When your vision returns, you’re standing in the center of the store once more, but everything has changed. The aisles are now completely still. Bubba stands by the tent, looking worried, but no longer seems to recognize you.
The walls have reset everything. It’s as if you’ve been trapped in an endless loop.
[[Loop back -&gt;Intro]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Try to find another exit" tags="" position="1425,675" size="100,100">You push forward through the shifting aisles, determined to find a way out. The shelves twist around you, rearranging themselves faster than you can keep up with. Every time you think you’ve found a path, it disappears behind you, replaced by more impossibly endless shelves.
After what feels like hours, you come to a sudden stop. A doorway appears before you—seemingly out of nowhere, bathed in a faint light. You walk toward it cautiously, heart pounding, hoping this is the exit you’ve been searching for.
As you step through the door, the world shifts. You’re no longer in the store, but standing in an open field under a strange sky. Bubba is beside you, looking equally confused.
&#39;Well, I guess that worked,&#39; he says, still looking around.
But something feels off. You have no idea where you are, and the air feels too still. It might be an escape… but it’s still a mystery.

The strange, liquid material seems to shimmer in ways that mirror the night sky—constellations twisting unnaturally, stars bleeding into each other.

You realize that the patterns aren’t random; they seem to be forming a map—a map of an entirely different reality, one where time and space bend in unpredictable ways.

But as you try to trace the stars, they shift and twist, mocking your efforts. The sense of disorientation is overwhelming, and for a moment, you lose your sense of direction entirely. The map you’ve begun to chart flickers out of existence, leaving you feeling helpless.

Bubba grabs your arm, pulling you away from the shifting walls. &quot;This is bad, Em. We need a new plan.&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="See if you can find a way to stabilize the surroundings" tags="" position="1400,325" size="100,100">You kneel down to inspect the walls more closely. The liquid material shifts beneath your fingertips, a strange substance that seems part organic, part mineral. It feels slick, almost like molten glass, yet it doesn’t burn you. It reflects odd colors—pinks, blues, and purples—in ways that seem impossible for regular materials.

You realize this isn’t just a wall—this is a manifestation of unstable, shifting geological forces. A form of rock, liquefied and manipulated by powerful forces beyond your understanding. If you can stabilize it, the walls might stop shifting, and perhaps you can re-establish some semblance of order.

Drawing on your geological knowledge, you attempt to apply pressure at key points, trying to lock the material into a more stable form. As you press your palms against the liquid wall, you feel a strange resistance. For a moment, it seems like the material might respond to you—then it pushes back violently, causing the walls to ripple.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Attempt to hack into the liquid material" tags="" position="1525,325" size="100,100">You activate the cybernetic implant in your arm, linking it to your internal network. The walls seem to pulse in rhythm with your movements as you try to interface with them. You focus your neural patterns, pushing the data streams from your implants into the liquid substance that surrounds you.

A sharp buzz in your skull signals a connection, but it’s not what you expected. The wall responds, not with access to any hidden systems, but with an invasive, overwhelming surge of information—images, sounds, voices—all jumbled and distorted. It’s as if you’ve accessed the thoughts of the walls themselves.

The flood of data overwhelms you. Your vision blurs as flashes of impossible images streak past your consciousness—holographic visions of faraway places, strange symbols, cryptic messages. A low hum fills the air, vibrating through your entire body. Just as you&#39;re about to disconnect, the ground beneath your feet shifts violently.

Your vision snaps back into focus, but it’s not the room you were just in. You find yourself in an entirely different environment—a small, sterile room with rows upon rows of humming servers and data terminals. The walls here are clean, smooth, and white, and you can hear the faint sound of machinery working in the background.

Bubba isn’t with you. In fact, you’re alone. The environment is stark, with no windows, no doors—just rows of equipment. Your head is spinning from the unexpected transition, and the last thing you remember was the pulsating liquid walls of the strange, shifting aisles.

[[Inspect the equipment]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Search for a hidden exit" tags="" position="1750,275" size="100,100">You pull out your dowsing rods and begin to scan the area, hoping to detect any hidden paths or exits. As you walk carefully through the shifting aisles, the rods vibrate in your hands, indicating something faintly ahead.

You follow the sensation, the rods guiding you as you approach what seems like an alcove in the walls—an opening that wasn’t there moments ago. The walls, still shifting, reveal a narrow gap, just wide enough for you to slip through.

Bubba gives you a skeptical look. &quot;You sure about this?&quot; he asks.

The rods pulse one last time, confirming the path is real. You nod. &quot;This is it. Let’s go.&quot;
[[Enter the gap]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Enter the gap" tags="" position="1925,350" size="100,100">You take a deep breath, your dowsing rods pulsing in your hands as you approach the gap. The walls tremble slightly, and the flickering lights grow erratic, casting strange shadows across the narrow passage. With no time to waste and no other options left, you gesture to Bubba.

“Let’s go,” you say, stepping into the gap.

As you squeeze through, the air around you feels different—heavier, colder. You hear strange whispers, like distant voices calling your name from all directions. Bubba follows you, but his steps falter. “I don’t like this, Em,” he mutters, but it’s too late to turn back now.

The gap leads you deeper into the labyrinthine structure, and as you go, the walls seem to close in around you. Your footsteps echo unnervingly, and the faint hum of the machinery becomes a distant thrum beneath your feet. You’re getting closer to something, but you’re not sure what.

Suddenly, the passageway opens up into a large chamber. At first, it appears empty, but then you notice something that makes your blood run cold.

In the center of the room stands a massive figure—hulking, twisted, and strangely mechanical. It seems to be a grotesque fusion of flesh and metal, a distorted amalgamation of the facility’s many secrets. The figure’s eyes are dark, cold voids that seem to devour the light, and its limbs twitch erratically, as though testing the space around it. The figure’s presence is overpowering, and the air feels thick with a palpable sense of dread.

Before you can react, a voice booms through the chamber, deep and guttural, vibrating through your bones.

“INTERLOPERS.”

The ground beneath you shakes as the figure steps forward, its heavy footfalls echoing. Bubba stumbles back, his eyes wide with terror. “Em… What the hell is that thing?”

The figure lunges forward, its metallic limbs scraping the floor with an unnatural screech. It&#39;s faster than it should be for its size. A cold wave of energy washes over you, and you instinctively reach for your weapon.

“YOU HAVE COME TOO FAR. NOW YOU WILL PAY.”

The room flickers and distorts as the figure moves to strike, its massive, claw-like hand swinging through the air with deadly precision. You barely manage to dodge, the sharp edges of its appendages narrowly missing you.

[[id: clawfight-&gt;Prepare to fight]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Inspect the equipment" tags="" position="1525,450" size="100,100">A terminal in the corner of the room flickers to life, displaying a message that seems to be addressing you:

&quot;ACCESS GRANTED.
WELCOME TO THE DATA CORE.&quot;

Suddenly, a low mechanical voice fills the room, and the terminal begins to relay unsettling data:

&quot;Subjugation complete. External subject: Em, located. Commence observation and monitoring.&quot;

A feeling of dread sweeps over you. This wasn’t a random shift in location. You’ve been moved to a secure, isolated data facility, and it seems like you’ve been identified as an “external subject.”

What is this place? Who or what is monitoring you? And more importantly, what is your role in all of this?

You hear the soft clicking of machinery around you, like gears winding into motion. A countdown begins on the terminal’s screen: &quot;5… 4… 3…&quot;

[[Try pressing buttons at random]]
[[Let the coundown finish]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Try pressing buttons at random" tags="" position="1825,525" size="100,100">You stare at the metallic panel next to the terminal, your hand hovering over a large, unmarked button. You’ve been trapped here for what feels like too long, and the pressure of the strange atmosphere is starting to get to you. The countdown, the messages, the cold, sterile space—it all feels like a trap.

With no other options and a growing sense of urgency, you press the button at random.

A sudden, deafening mechanical whirring fills the room, and the lights flicker above you. For a moment, everything goes black, and your heart races, but then a sharp, artificial voice fills the room again, echoing in every corner:

&quot;ERROR. RANDOM INPUT DETECTED.&quot;

The walls around you tremble, and the floor beneath your feet seems to shift, causing you to stumble. Your mind races, but there’s no time to second-guess your decision now. The whirring intensifies, and a series of high-pitched tones begin to play—like a computer trying to process something it doesn’t understand.

Suddenly, a large compartment in the floor opens with a hydraulic hiss, revealing a long, dark shaft leading down into an unknown abyss. The edges of the shaft are lined with bright, flickering lights, and there’s a faint sound coming from deep within—a low, almost rhythmic thumping, like something large moving down there.

Before you can fully comprehend what’s happening, a mechanical arm extends from the ceiling and grabs you by the arm with unnatural strength, pulling you toward the shaft’s edge.

&quot;WARNING. UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED. SYSTEM ERROR.&quot;

Bubba’s voice cuts through the panic, and you turn to see him stumbling out of nowhere, as if he just materialized back into existence. “Em! What did you do?” he yells, trying to reach you.

The mechanical arm is tightening its grip, and the lights flicker again. It’s like the entire room is alive now, responding to your mistake.

&quot;SUBJECT IN DANGER. AUTOMATED PROTOCOL ACTIVATED.&quot;

You have a split second to act before the arm drags you into the abyss below.

[[Try to free yourself from the mechanical arm -&gt;Wrestling]]

For a few seconds, all is silent. Then, you hear the hum of nearby machines intensify, as if they are waking up. You stand frozen in place, not sure if you’re meant to run, hide, or prepare for what’s to come.

The walls flicker momentarily, displaying strange symbols and diagrams—none of them making any sense to you. It’s as if this whole place is meant to observe or store information about you. The atmosphere shifts once more, colder now, almost sterile in its precision.

You move to the terminal to try to interact, but before you can, another message appears:

“EXTERNAL SUBJECT. YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED. INITIATING TESTING SEQUENCE.”

It’s cold, rigid, and unnaturally strong, but you manage to twist your arm free just in time. You fall backward onto the floor as the arm retracts, and the compartment below you shuts with a loud slam.

Bubba rushes to your side, breathless. “That was way too close, Em.”
[[Wait]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Stealth" tags="" position="1925,675" size="100,100">In the heat of the moment, you quickly duck and roll away from the mechanical arm’s reach, managing to escape its grip just before it pulls you into the abyss. Bubba yells in alarm, but you’re already on your feet, hidden beneath the shadow of a nearby terminal.

The arm retracts, and the system seems to reset, the hum of machinery dulling slightly. You’re safe—for now.

“What the hell was that?” Bubba mutters, eyes wide with disbelief.

“I think we’ve made it angry,” you reply, still feeling the aftershocks of the close call.
[[Wait]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Cybernetics" tags="" position="2050,675" size="100,100">You don’t hesitate for a second. You activate your cybernetic implant and attempt to send a counter-signal to the system controlling the mechanical arm. The room buzzes with energy as you desperately try to override its protocols.

The arm stutters, its movement slowing as the system attempts to recalibrate, but your implants manage to inject a scrambling signal. For a moment, it seems like the arm is going to stop. It’s struggling, its movements jerky as if it’s malfunctioning.

And then—success. The arm lets go, retracting sharply into the ceiling.

&quot;ACCESS TERMINATED. SYSTEM RESET.&quot;

The lights flicker one last time before returning to normal. You and Bubba are left standing in the now-still room, your heart still pounding from the ordeal.

Bubba looks at you with wide eyes. “That was close. Too close.”
[[Wait]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Wait" tags="" position="1925,800" size="100,100">The room, now quiet and unnervingly still, feels suffocating. The sterile white walls glisten under the harsh artificial light, and the strange hum of machinery is the only sound that fills the air. It’s as if the entire facility has paused in response to your recent interference, waiting for your next move.

Bubba’s footsteps echo as he paces nervously. “We need to get out of here, Em. Whatever this place is, it’s not something we should stick around to figure out.”

You agree, but you’re not sure where to go. Every direction seems to lead into the same oppressive void of machinery. The doors are sealed, the walls unyielding. But just as you start to lose hope, something changes.

The floor beneath you shudders once more, not violently like before, but with a soft, mechanical precision. Then, the wall to your left slides open with a quiet hiss, revealing a narrow passageway bathed in dim light. It’s an exit, or at least, it seems to be.

Without a word, you and Bubba move toward it, the air growing colder as you approach. The passageway stretches ahead, its walls lined with more of those strange symbols you encountered earlier—this time, they appear less cryptic, almost familiar. As you step forward, you notice that the walls seem to pulse with a faint, rhythmic energy, like a heartbeat.

The passage narrows further as you proceed, the silence in the space broken only by the sound of your footsteps and Bubba’s heavy breathing. Time feels warped here, and every moment seems to stretch longer than it should.

Finally, after what feels like an eternity, you reach a large, sealed door at the end of the passage. A keypad is mounted beside it, its screen glowing a soft green. You approach it cautiously, your hand hovering over the interface. You don’t have much time, but the message displayed on the screen seems to imply it’s meant for you:

“ACCESS GRANTED.
SUBJECT: EM. EXIT READY.”

A sharp metallic click fills the air as the door unlocks, and it slides open smoothly, revealing an entirely different world on the other side.

The air is thick with the scent of fresh grass and salt from the sea. You’re standing on the edge of a cliff, overlooking an expansive landscape—an unfamiliar coast. Below, a city sprawls across the horizon, ancient in design, yet alive with movement. It feels strange, out of place, but you’re certain it’s the exit you were searching for.

Bubba stares in disbelief, his voice barely a whisper. &quot;What… what is this place?&quot;

You step forward, the wind picking up as it whips around you. The world beyond feels like a strange blend of the real and the unreal, a place that doesn’t belong in the same reality you’ve known.

With no other choice but to move forward, you and Bubba leave the data center behind, stepping into the unknown.

The door slides shut behind you, and the world you’ve escaped from vanishes without a trace. You’re left in a new place, its mysteries waiting to unfold.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Prepare to fight" tags="" position="2050,475" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="Ignore the feeling of being watched and just enjoy camping with Bubba" tags="" position="625,475" size="100,100">You and Bubba settle into the strange camping spot you’ve made, the hum of the floor beneath your feet echoing in the silence. The atmosphere feels almost dreamlike, as though time doesn’t flow properly here. You take a deep breath, trying to shake the feeling that you’re being watched, but the eeriness of the place lingers.

As you get up to explore, you notice a few strange items left scattered around the shelves—trinkets that seem to radiate a soft, almost magical glow. You wander over to one shelf and find a small, intricately carved box. It seems old, maybe centuries old, but it’s strangely preserved, as if untouched by time.

“Look at this,” you murmur, holding it up to Bubba. He steps closer, his curiosity piqued.

“What is it? A puzzle box or something?”

You shake your head, unsure. As you carefully open it, you find an antique compass inside. But this isn’t any normal compass—the needle spins erratically, pointing in random directions.

“Is it broken?” Bubba asks.

You test it. The compass seems to react to the environment, moving erratically with the hum of the floor. You tuck it into your bag, feeling a strange connection to the device. Whatever this store is, it seems to be more than just a place—it might be a doorway to something larger.

After a few days of scavenging and exploring, the two of you decide to pack up and continue. You find some more strange items, including a delicate, glowing stone, which you keep in your pocket for later. The campsite feels like a small pocket of peace in the otherwise unsettling store.

Finally, after three days, you feel a shift in the air. The once-shifting walls now feel more stable, and you find a door that had been hidden behind a series of shelves. It opens easily, leading you outside to the bright, welcoming light of the outside world. You’re free at last.

You exchange a relieved smile with Bubba as you step into the fresh air, the strange items from the shelves safely tucked away. Whatever this place was, it’s over now.

The man disappears, leaving only the sound of wind in the air. Bubba gives you a side-eye. &quot;Well, that was weird. Let’s get back on the road.&quot;

The camper&#39;s tires groan under the rough terrain, and just as you’re about to suggest pulling over for a break, there’s a sudden boom! The camper jerks violently, and a sharp hiss of air fills the cabin.

“We’re flat!” Bubba yells, his voice laced with frustration. You glance out the window to see the front tire blown to bits—likely from a landmine. You groan in disbelief. Of course, you&#39;d end up in a minefield.

A quick scan of the area shows that the whole place is rigged with landmines, and to make things worse, strange, glowing arcane squids are floating in the air, their tentacles shimmering as they float lazily past.

“We gotta fix this wheel, and fast,” Bubba says, eyes darting nervously as he grabs a spare tire from the back of the camper.

If you can harness their energy, you might be able to spot safe zones.

The arcane squids swirl around you, their tentacles glowing brightly. You concentrate, channeling your magic into the ground beneath your feet. A soft hum resonates from the earth, and slowly, glowing lines form, marking the paths where it’s safe to walk.

You step cautiously, following the lines you&#39;ve created, and make it to the camper&#39;s tire. [[Start replacing the tire]]

The minefield sprawls in every direction, and the arcane squids drift about, pulsing with an eerie glow as they hover just above the ground. Their hum fills the air, adding a surreal tension as you ease the camper ahead, trying to avoid both mines and squids.

You take a breath, considering your options.

Just as you’re about to replace the wheel, you hear a click beneath your foot—there’s a mine right under you! 

You stay perfectly still, barely breathing. The slightest pressure might set off the mine. You glance at Bubba, who has gone pale, watching helplessly.

The air is thick with the scent of gasoline, and shadows linger around the edges of every building. Bubba mutters, “Not the kind of place I’d choose for a vacation, Em. What’s got you interested here?”

The name Enrico Mattei flashes across your mind—a figure shrouded in both controversy and legend, especially in these parts. Mattei’s death decades ago was officially ruled an accident, but rumors of the petromafia and petrodemons have long lingered. You’ve heard whispers that the truth lies buried somewhere around here, waiting to be uncovered.

His eyes dart to Bubba, then back to you, as if sizing you up.

“Passing through?” he asks, his voice gruff. You notice a faint, almost nervous tremor in his voice as he speaks.

Bubba shivers, glancing around. “Something’s wrong here, Em. I feel it.”

As you reach a secluded area, you spot strange symbols carved into the rocks and an ancient oil well spewing dark fumes into the air. The markings remind you of demon-summoning rituals, but with a peculiar petrochemical twist.

Mattei once stood up against the powerful oil cartels, but his enemies had deep pockets and darker allies. His death remains suspicious—a plane crash with evidence tampered and witnesses silenced.

Bubba leans in, “If the petromafia was involved, do you think they… summoned something?”

He threatened the oil monopolies, and they didn’t like that one bit. People say… it wasn’t just the petromafia involved. Dark things, things beyond human control, were set loose to deal with him.”

You catch Bubba’s wide-eyed glance. “You mean… demons?”

The attendant’s face goes pale. “Petrodemons, summoned to curse him and anyone who dared dig too deep.”

These marks are laced with dark enchantments meant to call forth petrodemons, bound to haunt and destroy the enemies of the petromafia.

Bubba’s face pales. “Someone’s been keeping these demons close to control whoever dares step out of line.”

You set up a circle with candles and focus your mind, calling out to Enrico Mattei’s spirit.

A cold breeze fills the room, and the candles flicker. A faint voice whispers, “They… they used something darker than I could imagine… petromafia… petrodemons…”

The spirit’s voice fades in and out, but you catch fragments of words—summoning, betrayal, cursed.

The attendant’s eyes dart around nervously, then he relents, whispering, “They say Mattei tried to strike a deal with powers far darker than the oil companies. When he crossed them, they summoned something ancient, bound to the oil wells. It wasn’t just an accident… it was retribution.”

A shiver runs down your spine as he finishes. The petromafia didn’t just want Mattei gone—they cursed him.

The markings flicker, resisting at first, but then they fade, leaving only faint traces behind.

A shudder ripples through the earth, and a low growl echoes in the distance. Bubba’s voice is barely a whisper, “Em… did you hear that?”

Bubba grips your arm, his face pale. “Maybe we should get out of here, Em…”

But you sense something ancient and restless, bound to the ground below. This might be your only chance to confront a petrodaemon in its natural territory.

He eyes the talisman skeptically but eventually nods, pocketing it. “There’s one well deep in the forest, near the mountain’s base. It’s the darkest one of all—some say it’s where they first summoned the petrodemons.”

Armed with new knowledge, you and Bubba head toward the forest, feeling the air grow colder with each step.

As you reach the edge of the forest, a faint rumble shakes the earth, as if the spirits themselves are restless. You realize that unearthing the petromafia’s secrets might lead you deeper into a web of darkness than you anticipated, but your curiosity burns as brightly as ever.

A thick, sulfurous fog rises from the ground, swirling into the shape of a creature with blazing eyes and a molten core. The petrodaemon speaks, its voice rumbling through the valley.

“WHY… DO YOU DISTURB MY DOMAIN?”

You gulp, but stand firm, determined to uncover the truth about Mattei.

The petrodaemon reveals the truth in cryptic terms: “A pact sealed with fire, a betrayal punished by oil and flame.” Its voice fades as it retreats back into the earth, leaving you with a haunting sense of Mattei’s final moments. The petromafia’s reach was deeper than you imagined, spanning both mortal and infernal realms.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Piece together clues from Mattei’s past that connect him to supernatural forces" tags="" position="475,1200" size="100,100">The more you dig through the clues, the more certain you become. Mattei’s stance against oil monopolies put him at odds with powerful enemies, but his death seemed to trigger strange phenomena around these oil wells. Some locals even spoke of “fire-breathing shadows” appearing near the crash site shortly after his death.

You realize Mattei’s fate was sealed by more than just human hands. You and Bubba glance at each other, a silent understanding passing between you—you’re dealing with something dark and deeply embedded in the land.

Mattei’s legacy isn’t just about a man or his fight—it’s about the ancient power that still festers beneath the ground. As you leave the town, you feel the weight of knowledge that Mattei’s sacrifice may have only delayed the inevitable darkness that binds the oil wells.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>

Suddenly, Bubba stops, staring wide-eyed into the distance. &quot;Em… is that… a stegosaurus?&quot;

You squint, following his gaze. There, among the trees, a massive, herbivorous dinosaur stands peacefully, its iconic spiked tail swaying gently as it munches on the vegetation.

&quot;Well, I’ll be…&quot; you mutter, your curiosity piqued.
