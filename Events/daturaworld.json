      "text": "You’re driving through an unfamiliar stretch of road when the camper jerks, a sudden jolt that rattles the whole vehicle. Bubba’s ears perk up as he lifts his head, but his usual relaxed demeanor vanishes when the world outside starts to warp. The road ahead twists unnaturally, like a ribbon pulling itself into knots.\n\n“What the—?” You slam the brakes, but it’s too late. The entire landscape melts, shifting from one bizarre scene to another, until you're surrounded by a fog so thick it feels alive.\n\nThe camper shudders to a stop, but the world around you doesn’t. Strange, vaporous tendrils snake out from the fog, slithering across the ground like some primordial creature searching for prey.\n\n\"Em... this ain't right,\" Bubba mutters, his fur bristling. You glance out the window and realize you can’t see more than a few feet beyond the camper.\n\nSuddenly, you hear a voice—faint but growing louder.\n\n“You should not have come here…” it whispers, as if the wind itself is speaking. The air thickens with a scent of something bitter—like burning herbs and rotten fruit.\n    [[Step outside and face the fog->Neutral Ending]]\n\n    [[Try to cast a protective spell to escape the dimension->Good Ending]]\n\n    [[Panic and lock the doors, hoping the fog will leave->Bad Ending]]\n\n",

      "text": "You quickly decide to cast a protective spell—anything to get out of this strange dimension before it swallows you whole. Your fingers move over your spellbook, muttering the incantations as your breath quickens. The fog presses closer, but you focus, channeling your magic.\n\nWith a sharp word, a barrier of shimmering light surrounds the camper, and the fog seems to recoil, as if it can’t touch you anymore. The voices fall silent, and the oppressive air lightens. Bubba watches, his tail flicking in nervous anticipation.\n\n“You did it,” Bubba says, a breath of relief escaping his lips. \"I knew you'd figure it out.\"\n\nYou continue driving, the fog eventually dissipating, leaving you with nothing but the eerie silence of the strange world behind you. You keep the magic strong, just in case, but the air now feels… less alive, less oppressive.\n\nYou breathe deeply, glancing at Bubba. “That was too close. Let's keep moving. I don't know what that place was, but I don't want to see it again.”\n\n[[Continue...]]",

If we’re stuck here, we’ll never know until we try.”\n\nBubba growls lowly, clearly nervous. “You sure about this, Em?”\n\nYou nod, gripping the door handle. The moment your foot touches the ground, the fog presses in around you, dense and heavy. Shapes loom just out of the corner of your vision—shifting, twisting, and whispering. Your mind races, memories of datura trips and hallucinations flashing before your eyes, but this feels so much worse. The whispers grow louder, as if the fog is speaking directly into your brain.\n\nA sudden burst of movement catches your eye—a figure in the mist, a face with eyes too large for its head, staring directly at you. You freeze, heart thumping painfully in your chest.\n\nThe figure doesn’t move, but you feel the air grow colder, more oppressive. You back away slowly, returning to the camper. Bubba’s eyes are wide, a mix of confusion and fear.\n\n“Yeah, no more of that,” he says, growling. \"Let's just leave, Em. We can't stick around here.\"\n\nThe camper lurches as you hit the gas, driving off, but you can still feel the weight of the fog clinging to your skin.\n\n[[Continue...]]",

Bubba follows your command, his paws scrambling for the locks, but the fog outside presses up against the windows, as though it’s searching for a way in.\n\nThe air grows thick, suffocating, and every time you try to breathe, it feels like the fog is filling your lungs. The whispers grow louder, more insistent, their words now unmistakable: “Leave... or become part of us...”\n\nSuddenly, the camper lurches, as if the ground itself is pulling it under. The walls creak, and for a terrifying moment, you’re sure the entire vehicle will collapse. Bubba’s growls turn to whimpers as the fog curls around the camper like a serpent, pulling you deeper into its suffocating grip.\n\nWith one final screech of metal, the camper stalls, leaving you both trapped in the thickening fog. The last thing you hear is a whisper in your ear, a promise: \"You are ours now.\"\n\n[[Continue...]]",
