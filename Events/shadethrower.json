Their eyes gleam with mischief as they extend a hand, and suddenly, a small, cold shadow flits toward you, wrapping around you and blocking the light. The figure chuckles, “Consider that a little shade, witch.” You realize the figure can literally throw shade—a playful, yet annoying trick.\n[[Return the favor with a shadow of your own->Good Ending]]\n\n[[Laugh it off and walk away->Neutral Ending]]\n\n[[Challenge the stranger to a magical duel->Bad Ending]]",
