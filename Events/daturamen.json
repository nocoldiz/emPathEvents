      "text": "You and Bubba are driving through a hazy landscape, the camper rolling over an uneven road. You glance over at him as he lazily lounges in the backseat, puffing away at yet another cigar.\n\n“Bubba,” you start, voice low, “Do you ever think about Beagle? You know, the city we’re heading to?”\n\nBubba blows out a cloud of smoke, his eyes half-lidded. He doesn’t seem to hear you at first, but then he looks over at you with a slow, puzzled expression.\n\n“Beagle?” he repeats, flicking the ash from his cigar. “Yeah… sure. I mean, yeah. I guess that’s where we’re going, right? But…” He trails off, looking out the window as if searching for something he can’t quite grasp. \"I dunno, Em. I can’t really remember much about it, y’know? It’s all foggy... like one of those... you know... datura seed trips. Lotta weird, twisting things that don’t make sense.”\n\nYou raise an eyebrow, not entirely surprised. \"What do you mean? You don’t remember anything at all?\"\n\nBubba shakes his head slowly, his gaze distant. “Nothin' solid. Just flashes. Lots of smoke... and shadows… Some big, dark sky, with people who didn’t really have faces… and a lotta cigars. So many cigars.”\n\nYou stare at him, baffled. \"You mean, you remember nothing? Not even how we got here?\"\n\nBubba looks at you like he’s just come out of a trance. \"Oh, we’re in a camper, right? Well, that’s somethin’ at least.\"\n\nYou let out a sigh, unsure how to process it all. He’s just as lost in the haze as the rest of you. You start to wonder if you’ll ever really make it to Beagle at all, or if it's just another half-remembered dream.\n\n\n    [[Try to jog Bubba’s memory further with some details about Beagle->Neutral Ending]]\n\n    [[Decide to let Bubba be and focus on the road ahead->Good Ending]]\n\n    [[Get frustrated and ask Bubba to stop smoking so much->Bad Ending]]",

Maybe we’ll figure it out when we get there.”\n\nBubba nods slowly, content to smoke in silence. The road stretches on ahead, and though the destination is uncertain, you feel oddly calm. Some things are just better left to the journey, especially with Bubba at your side.\n\nThe camper rolls on, and for the first time, you’re not as worried about Beagle—whatever it is.\n\n[[Continue...]]\n",

Anything?”\n\nBubba closes his eyes for a moment, trying to concentrate, but then shakes his head again. “Nah. It’s like… like a dream that slips away every time I try to hold on to it. All I know is… cigars. Everywhere. And some kinda clock. But I can’t figure out what it means.”\n\nFrustrated but not surprised, you let the conversation die out. At least you’ve learned that, despite everything, Bubba is as mysterious as ever. You continue your journey in silence, both of you lost in your own thoughts as the camper hums down the road toward the unknown.\n\n[[Continue...]]",

I told you, it’s all just a haze.”\n\nFrustrated, you grab the cigar from his mouth and toss it out the window. \"Enough of this. You're acting like you're in some kind of trance!\"\n\nBubba’s tail flicks in agitation. “Hey, hey! What the heck is wrong with you?” he growls. “You know I can’t help it. Just let me be.”\n\nThe mood sours, and now even the road ahead seems darker. Tension fills the air as you both settle into an uncomfortable silence, neither of you feeling any closer to Beagle—or each other.\n\n[[Continue...]]",
