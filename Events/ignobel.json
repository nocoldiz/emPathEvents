      "text": "You’re sitting in your camper, parked near a research station in a desolate dimension where the laws of physics seem to fluctuate wildly. You’ve been experimenting with some old tomes and a few discarded scientific journals that you scavenged along your travels, looking for new ways to combine magic and science. Bubba, as usual, lounges by your side, occasionally pawing at an old coffee mug that rolls off the table.\n\nWhile idly flipping through a particularly bizarre manuscript on quantum mechanics and transdimensional mechanics, you stumble upon a strange phenomenon: particles that behave in an entirely unexpected way when subjected to magical energy. The more you ponder it, the more it makes sense. If you adjust the electromagnetic properties of a field just so, the particles begin to act in an oscillating pattern that defies known laws—creating a new force you dub \"Erratic Magnetic Oscillation\" or EMO. It’s as if magic and physics are now intertwined in a way no one has ever thought possible.\n\nExcited, you conduct a few small experiments using some basic equipment you’ve scrounged together. The results are astounding. For the first time in history, magic and physics are acting in harmony, bending the rules of nature in a way no one could have predicted. You can't wait to share your findings with the world.\n[[Send your discovery to the scientific community->Neutral Ending]]\n\n[[Present your discovery at a major conference->Good Ending]]\n\n[[Keep the discovery secret and study it further alone->Bad Ending]]",

As you speak, there’s an air of skepticism in the room, but your detailed explanation and experimental data win over the crowd. It doesn’t take long before you’re thrust into the spotlight as the scientist who dared to merge magic with physics.\n\nA few weeks later, you receive an invitation to the Ig Nobel Prize ceremony, where your groundbreaking discovery is celebrated with the utmost enthusiasm. The announcement of your award is met with applause, and you accept the prize with a proud smile. The world may have laughed at your work at first, but now you’ve made history. The new law of Erratic Magnetic Oscillation will forever be associated with your name.\n\n[[Continue...]]",
