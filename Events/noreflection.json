Bubba is lying in the back, his usual calm demeanor a comforting presence. But as you glance into the side mirror to check your rearview, something feels… off.\n\nThe reflection in the mirror is no longer showing the road behind you. Instead, it's a dark, empty void—a swirling, black mist that seems to pulse ominously. You blink and check the other mirror, only to find the same thing: no road, no trees, just the empty, swirling void.\n\nBubba growls from the back, clearly sensing something strange. You feel a chill run up your spine.\n\n[[Check the mirrors with a magical diagnostic spell->Good Ending]]\n\n[[Ignore it and continue driving, hoping it’s nothing->Neutral Ending]]\n\n[[Pull over and investigate the mirrors directly->Bad Ending]]",

As the magic flows, the mirrors shimmer and flicker, revealing the true reflection once more: the road and trees behind you, nothing more, nothing less. It seems the mirrors had temporarily been affected by a magical anomaly, but with your spell, they've returned to normal. Bubba relaxes, and you continue your journey, a little more cautious but confident in your ability to deal with such strange occurrences.\n[[Continue...]]",

The moment you step outside, the air feels thick, heavy with an unnatural weight. As you approach the mirrors, the black mist suddenly begins to seep out, twisting around you like fingers reaching for your soul. Bubba barks in alarm as the mist begins to pull at your feet, and before you can react, the mirrors crack open, releasing a dark, distorted version of your reflection—a grotesque, grinning version of yourself that steps out of the glass. You scramble back into the camper, slamming the door as the mist retreats, but you know now that the mirrors have become a dangerous gateway.\n\n[[Continue...]]",
