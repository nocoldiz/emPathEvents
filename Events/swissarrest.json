Emerging from the fog are a group of Swiss Guards in full ceremonial armor, accompanied by a stern-faced police officer who steps forward, a gleam of suspicion in his eyes.\n\n“By order of the Holy Council, you are to be detained,” he declares, hand on his holster. The guards surround the camper, their halberds gleaming as they raise them in a defensive ring. “We know you and the Mages Guild were responsible for… His demise,” he says, voice dripping with accusation. “Now, come quietly, or we’ll use force.”\n\nBubba tenses beside you, growling low in his throat. It’s clear you’ll need to act quickly if you want to avoid a holy confrontation.\n\n[[Attempt a powerful illusion spell to disguise yourself->Good Ending]]\n\n[[Try to talk your way out of the situation->Neutral Ending]]\n\n[[Make a break for it and try to outrun them->Bad Ending]]",

The two of you wait out the downpour in dry comfort, even managing to brew some tea as thunder cracks around you.\n\n[[Continue...]]",
