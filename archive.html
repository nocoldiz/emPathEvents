He shuffles his notes, clearly a bit lost. The fluorescent lights buzz overhead, and you catch Bubba’s eye through the one-way mirror outside, giving you a reassuring thumbs-up.

Agent Blane adjusts his tie, looking at you with the determination of someone who has no idea what he’s doing.

Blane clears his throat and fumbles with his notepad. “So, uh… can you tell me why you’re here today?”
You smile politely, leaning back. This could be fun.

[[bluffing, 15, &quot;I&#39;m just here to help you understand magic.&quot; Blane looks doubtful but nods slowly. -&gt; Explain “basic” magic principles to him]]

[[empathy, 10, &quot;I was passing by and thought you needed a hand.&quot; He looks genuinely grateful for a moment. -&gt; Offer to &quot;assist&quot; with his investigation]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name=" Explain “basic” magic principles to him" tags="" position="100,450" size="100,100">You launch into a convoluted explanation of “basic” magic, combining real magic with complete nonsense. Blane’s eyes glaze over as he tries to follow.

[[arcanism, 20, &quot;And so, the second law of arcanodynamics states….&quot; Blane looks even more lost. -&gt; Keep explaining in circles until he’s confused enough to end the questioning]]

[[convoking, 25, &quot;I had to summon a, uh, minor deity to get here today.&quot; Blane’s mouth drops open. -&gt; Expand on this absurd claim and see how much he’ll believe]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name=" Offer to &quot;assist&quot; with his investigation" tags="" position="450,425" size="100,100">Leaning forward, you give Blane a friendly smile. “Look, I can tell you’re busy. How about I help you out with your case?”

Blane brightens at the offer, nodding enthusiastically. “Uh, yeah! That’d be… great, actually.”

[[diplomacy, 10, You reassure him that you’re an expert in all things magical and law-related. -&gt; Offer to &quot;help him&quot; question yourself, creating nonsense as you go]]

[[observation, 15, You notice his notepad has barely any notes, just scribbles. -&gt; Pretend to answer “his” questions by reading them out loud]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name=" Keep explaining in circles until he’s confused enough to end the questioning" tags="" position="50,575" size="100,100">You ramble on about “the planar refraction of mystical energies” and “transdimensional gridline interferences.” Blane’s eyes cross as he tries to follow along, eventually giving up and rubbing his temples.

Blane thanks you for your time, clearly not understanding a single word. You leave the room feeling rather proud of your performance.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name=" Expand on this absurd claim and see how much he’ll believe" tags="" position="175,575" size="100,100">You give a solemn nod and describe a complicated “deity summoning ritual,” explaining that it involved intricate chants, a few rare herbs, and a massive cauldron. Blane’s mouth hangs open as he scribbles madly in his notebook.

[[bluffing, 10, You mention that the deity might be in the room right now. Blane pales, glancing around nervously. -&gt; Watch his reaction and try not to laugh]]

[[history, 15, You pull some names from ancient lore, convincing him they’re &quot;high-ranking officials in the magical realm.&quot; -&gt; Use this to invent a full &quot;council&quot; Em supposedly reports to]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name=" Offer to &quot;help him&quot; question yourself, creating nonsense as you go" tags="" position="375,550" size="100,100">You nod seriously. “Alright, let’s start with an easy one: How does one measure the arcane density of a portal?”

Blane blinks, completely thrown off. “Uh… yeah. Sure.”

End: You keep posing absurd questions, getting Blane to nod along. By the end, he’s so turned around he just waves you off, none the wiser.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name=" Pretend to answer “his” questions by reading them out loud" tags="" position="500,550" size="100,100">You lean over, “accidentally” catching a glimpse of his empty notepad. You start answering imaginary questions as though he’s asked them.

&quot;Ah, yes, about the interdimensional disturbances I’ve been causing…” you begin, launching into a complete fabrication. Blane just nods, furiously writing down every word.

End: By the end of it, he’s recorded a long, nonsensical confession you’ve invented. You walk away, holding back laughter as he pores over his useless notes.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name=" Watch his reaction and try not to laugh" tags="" position="112.5,700" size="100,100">You casually mention that the deity you summoned might still be lingering in the room. Blane’s eyes widen, and he looks around, eyes darting to the shadows in the corners.

He clears his throat nervously, obviously unsure if you’re serious. “Uh, well, let’s hope they’re friendly…”

End: You smile, maintaining the serious facade as you leave. Blane looks genuinely spooked, clearly more afraid of magic now than he ever was.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name=" Use this to invent a full &quot;council&quot; Em supposedly reports to" tags="" position="237.5,700" size="100,100">You explain that you’re actually under the orders of a secret magical council composed of “the highest-ranking officials in the arcane world,” dropping names like “Elder Mysticum of the Arcane Realm” and “Grand Sorceress Celestialia.”

Blane’s eyes go wide, and he writes furiously. “So, you’re saying… there’s a magical government?”

“Of course,” you say smoothly, watching him take it all in.

Blane is overwhelmed and sends you off, muttering about needing “higher clearance” for magical cases.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Not believe" tags="" position="425,725" size="100,100">“So… let me get this straight. You’re telling me you’re part of a secret, interdimensional, magical government?” He looks down at his notes, scribbling in disbelief.

[[bluffing, 15, You lean forward and nod seriously, adding more details about your &quot;important role&quot; in this council. -&gt; Lead him into a wild tangent about the “Cosmic Alignment Project”]]

[[intelligence, 20, You cleverly mention that certain “classified artifacts” in your possession would blow his mind. -&gt; Mention the “Ark of the Universe” and how it’s better left secret]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name=" Lead him into a wild tangent about the “Cosmic Alignment Project”" tags="" position="362.5,850" size="100,100">You nod solemnly, explaining that your role in the council involves overseeing a top-secret project—The Cosmic Alignment Project—a plan to recalibrate the multiverse’s energy flow.

Blane’s jaw drops as he takes frantic notes, barely able to keep up. “Wait, recalibrate the multiverse? But… how?”

You tap your fingers on the table dramatically. “It involves very delicate magical rituals, the manipulation of gravity wells, and, of course, several millennia-old texts. But… well, I’m not authorized to explain too much.”

End: Blane looks utterly overwhelmed and blurts out, “Okay, okay, I think I need to call… someone higher up. This is too much.” You leave with an air of superiority, leaving him spinning in circles.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name=" Mention the “Ark of the Universe” and how it’s better left secret" tags="" position="487.5,850" size="100,100">You lean back, the image of mystery. “There are… certain artifacts, you see. Powerful, ancient artifacts that can change the course of history. The Ark of the Universe, for instance, could literally reshape reality as we know it.”

Blane’s pen scratches the paper furiously, but his expression shows he’s not sure whether he should be terrified or just confused. “The Ark… it sounds… dangerous?”

“Very,” you reply, giving him an intense stare. “And it’s far too powerful for your average agent to understand.”

End: Blane shudders, and his eyes dart nervously around the room. “I think I’ll need to consult with my supervisor…” You smile and leave, knowing you’ve left him questioning everything.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Crash in hallway" tags="" position="700,725" size="100,100">Blane jumps in his seat, looking startled. “What was that?” His hand hovers over his radio as though ready to alert his team.

[[intuition, 20, You get the feeling that the noise was caused by Bubba causing a distraction outside. -&gt; Nod and suggest it’s nothing to worry about]]

[[observation, 15, You notice Blane’s nervousness has peaked, and he seems ready to dismiss the interview entirely. -&gt; Push on with more absurdity to finish the job]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name=" Nod and suggest it’s nothing to worry about" tags="" position="637.5,850" size="100,100">With a casual wave, you brush off the noise. “It’s nothing, just a, uh, dimensional fluctuation. Happens all the time in these areas.”

Blane, clearly not understanding, nods quickly and writes down &quot;dimensional fluctuation&quot; as though he’s heard of it before. “Uh… okay. Sure. I’ll… I’ll look into it.”

End: Blane nervously wraps up the interrogation, muttering something about “advanced security” and “secret dimensional shifts.” You walk out victorious, leaving him thoroughly confused.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name=" Push on with more absurdity to finish the job" tags="" position="762.5,850" size="100,100">You lean in a bit closer and dramatically whisper, “You know, Blane, the truth is… sometimes the noise isn’t really a noise at all. It’s the sound of a new timeline slipping into existence. We’re in a moment of collapse, and if you don’t act soon—”

Blane interrupts, looking up from his notes with wide eyes. “Wait, what? You mean we’re—?”

You cut him off with a smile. “I’m afraid I can’t say more. Top-secret, you know.”

End: Blane stumbles out of the room, his mind racing with new questions. You leave, confident you’ve completely turned the tables on the agent.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Free to go" tags="" position="525,1000" size="100,100">“I… I just don’t think I’m equipped for this. You’re free to go.”

[[bluffing, 10, You smile and thank him for his “time” and “cooperation.” -&gt; Exit with a flourish, feeling proud of your performance]]

[[empathy, 10, You sense he’s genuinely relieved the interrogation is over. -&gt; Give him a fake promise to “assist” with future inquiries]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name=" Exit with a flourish, feeling proud of your performance" tags="" position="462.5,1125" size="100,100">You stand up, nodding respectfully. “Thank you for your time, Agent Blane. You’ve been… incredibly helpful.” You walk to the door with a flourish, leaving Blane to wonder if he just failed a mission in some strange new reality.

End: Outside, you high-five Bubba, who’s waiting at the door. “Easy pickings,” you say with a grin.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name=" Give him a fake promise to “assist” with future inquiries" tags="" position="587.5,1125" size="100,100">You put on your most sincere face and offer, “If you need any help with this… whole CIA magic thing you’ve got going on, feel free to reach out. I’ll be in touch.”

Blane smiles weakly, clearly relieved to be rid of you. “Right. I’ll keep that in mind…”

End: You leave the room, knowing full well he’ll never ask for your help. You’ve made a new friend in the most unhelpful way possible.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>

The Advanced Magical Theory exam lies before you, filled with arcane symbols and equations you’ve barely seen before. Glancing around, you notice several other witches deep in concentration. Bubba, your trusty buddy, sneaks you a wink from the hallway window, holding up a crumpled piece of paper.

[[Attempt the exam honestly]]
[[Use magical sleight of hand to cheat]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Attempt the exam honestly" tags="" position="325,400" size="100,100">You take a deep breath and start on the first page.

Just as you’re about to use it, the exam supervisor’s enchanted crow glides overhead, its beady eyes glinting.

[[stealth, 30, The crow catches a glint from your mirror and caws loudly. -&gt; Hide the mirror and try a different trick]]

The professor’s gaze flickers over you, his expression unreadable.

[[intuition, 15, You get a nagging feeling he suspects something. -&gt; Try to act more natural]]

[[observation, 30, Your gaze lingers too long, and the student notices. -&gt; Look away quickly and try another strategy]]

Then an idea comes to mind. You discreetly cast ScryNote, a spell that reveals nearby magical text through vibrations, letting you “read” another student’s notes by feel alone.

[[arcanism, 40, The spell falters, and you accidentally tap into the professor’s notes instead. -&gt; Try to decrypt his notes before he notices]]

[[intuition, 30, The vibrations are unclear, and you need more focus. -&gt; Cast the spell again with a steadier hand]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name=" Continue using the mirror" tags="" position="637.5,525" size="100,100">Feigning a yawn, you hold up the enchanted mirror, using it to peek at the notes of a particularly studious witch in the next row.

[[linguistics, 25, The rune’s meaning is unfamiliar, and you can’t decode it. -&gt; Keep copying it and hope it’s useful]]

You catch fragments of hints, barely enough to form answers.

You pull out a small enchanted feather from your bag—a WhisperQuill that picks up whispers and murmurs nearby. As the feather vibrates slightly in your palm, you hope to catch any mutterings from other students.

[[observation, 25, The room is too silent, and you hear only the creak of desks. -&gt; Pretend to be intensely focused]]

The streets are deserted, and an uneasy feeling hangs in the air. You hear whispers of shadows and catch fleeting glimpses of ghostly figures lurking just out of sight.

As you round a corner, Bubba nudges you. “Look,” he says, pointing to an alleyway where a flickering neon sign reads, “Kitsune’s Charm Tavern.” Inside, strange figures mingle—some look alien, some yokai, all suspiciously watching your every move.

As she makes her decision, she feels the spirit of the Great Guardian watching her, as if it’s already inside her mind. Is she making her own choice, or has the Guardian’s subtle influence already taken hold?

“Well, well. Another one of us. Let’s see how this Em fares.” You squint into the darkness and see... yourself. A nearly identical version of you, gazing back with a knowing smirk.

They seem as curious about you as you are about them.

One Em speaks up, her voice hollow. “There’s no way out, you know. We’re all stuck here.”

As you try to move, you realize you’re strapped to a cold, metallic surface. Bubba is nowhere to be seen. Panic rises, but a voice, familiar yet unsettling, drifts through the air.

“Well, well. Another one of us. Let’s see how this Em fares.” You squint into the darkness and see... yourself. A nearly identical version of you, gazing back with a knowing smirk.

Each one of us here took a different path, got lost, or ended up… misplaced. We’ve all been collected by something beyond our understanding.”

She gestures to the darkness around you, where you can barely make out other figures in the shadows—other “Em’s,” each subtly different.

The other Em raises an eyebrow. “Fighting won’t help you. Trust me, we’ve all tried it.” Her voice has a tinge of sadness, as if she’s already resigned to this place.

The walls are seamless metal, and several dimly lit consoles flash with symbols you don’t recognize. Around you stand other versions of yourself, each with subtle differences—a scar on the cheek, a different hairstyle, a robe in a shade you never chose. They seem as curious about you as you are about them.

One Em speaks up, her voice hollow. “There’s no way out, you know. We’re all stuck here.”

She sighs. “We didn’t choose to be here. We were… collected by a higher intelligence. Something that’s curious about how many versions of you it can gather. Each of us has been brought here at different points in time, plucked from our own dimensions.”

The scenery is bleak—a barren, rocky expanse with little vegetation or sign of life. But then, as the wheels of the camper hit an unusually large bump, there’s a strange grinding sound. The vehicle shakes, and for a moment, the engine sputters.

&quot;Did we hit something?&quot; Bubba asks, looking out the window.

You slow the camper and pull over, stepping out to investigate. In front of you, the ground has cracked open, revealing a hidden fissure beneath. Rocks are scattered around, and there, in the center of the fissure, you see something that makes your blood run cold—an ancient, withered body half-buried in the rocks. It’s human, but unnaturally old, almost impossibly so. The figure’s eyes are closed, its limbs stiff and lifeless, but you feel something stirring in the air.

Suddenly, the body’s chest expands, a faint breath escaping from its lips. The figure is alive.

Bubba is already running toward the camper, attempting to start the engine, but it stalls as the rocks shake the ground.

“Em!” Bubba shouts. “We need to get out of here before this guy turns the whole area into rubble!”

You look back at El-Zharun, who is standing amidst the storm of flying rocks, his eyes locked on you with a hunger in them. The temperature is plummeting rapidly, and the air feels thick with the weight of the curse.

[[Stealth, 60, You try to sneak around El-Zharun and reach the camper without drawing attention. Fail: Your movements are too slow, and the ground trembles violently, sending you tumbling to the ground. -&gt; Make a run for it, hoping to outrun El-Zharun’s power]]

Its skin is leathery, cracked, and ancient. But its eyes snap open, glowing with an unnatural gleam. The figure slowly lifts its head and stares at you, its lips curling into a faint smile.

&quot;You... disturbed my slumber...&quot; the figure rasps, its voice like the grinding of rocks. &quot;And now... I must awaken.&quot;

The rocks around it crack and shift as it begins to sit up, groaning under its own weight. There’s an oppressive air surrounding it, the temperature around you dropping as if the very earth itself was reacting to its presence.

“Who are you?” you ask, trying to keep your voice steady.

“I am... El-Zharun,” it croaks, its voice like thunder echoing in your mind. “I have slept beneath these rocks for millennia, hidden from the world. And now... now I shall rise again.”

&quot;You have disturbed my tomb,&quot; he says, his voice a low, guttural growl. &quot;And now... you will see what happens when one awakens the Andiluvian!&quot;

Suddenly, the earth beneath your feet trembles violently. The air feels charged with ancient energy as El-Zharun raises his hand, causing the rocks around you to rise and swirl in a chaotic storm.

The next, the world around you warps and fractures, twisting into a kaleidoscopic maze. Bubba vanishes, leaving you alone. You feel a shiver as a voice fills the space, sneering and cackling.

“Ahhh, Em! Finally! Do you know how boring it’s been, waiting for someone like you?” The voice fluctuates, veering from eerie calm to high-pitched excitement. “I’m Syther, servant of chaos, messenger of discord—and I’m here to have a little fun with you!”

He materializes, draped in dark robes that shift as if alive, his eyes twitching with manic glee. His grin is too wide, like a stretched mask. “We’re going to play a game. Simple rules. The stakes? Oh, just your soul, maybe a bit more… a lot more. We’ll see what’s left of you at the end.”

[[Intuition, 30, His exaggerated gestures make it clear he’s compensating for a weakness. -&gt; Study his expression for clues]]

Candles flicker wildly on the walls, casting eerie shapes as you find yourself standing on a checkered floor. A throne sits at the far end, and Syther gestures grandly for you to step onto a game board.

“Each round, I’ll pose riddles, set challenges,” he says, swinging between a taunting drawl and shrill excitement. “Win, and you get closer to freedom. Fail, and I’ll… well, you’ll see.”

The shadowy figures watch in unsettling silence, faces hidden, but their eyes gleam, almost eager.

[[Cryptography, 25, You notice faint symbols on the floor tiles that might offer a clue. -&gt; Examine the checkered tiles for hidden meaning]]

He recites the riddle in an unsteady tone: “I can be cracked, made, told, and played. What am I?”

[[Intuition, 25, You analyze the words, trying to decode their meaning. Fail: The riddle’s too vague, and Syther mocks your struggle as a headache fogs your mind. -&gt; Attempt to solve the riddle]]

Syther’s grin flickers as he clenches his jaw. His head jerks unnaturally, but he forces a smile. “Right. Ha. Ha. A joke. Very funny, Em. Don’t get cocky.”

He snaps his fingers, opening a mist-filled doorway ahead.

[[Spiritism, 30, You feel an eerie pull from the mist, as if it’s watching you. Fail: You hesitate too long, and Syther&#39;s laughter echoes as the mist closes in, chilling you. -&gt; Enter the misty doorway cautiously]]

Syther’s eyes gleam with barely contained glee as you stammer. He snaps his fingers, and a flash of pain arcs through you as he lets out a shrill laugh.

“Ohh, dear! That was painful!” He claps his hands. “I think I’ll take… ah, yes, a bit of your spark.”

You feel your magic dim slightly, like a light just snuffed.

[[Recover from the disorienting loss, realizing the stakes are higher than you thought -&gt; Continue to the next round with heightened caution]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name=" Continue to the next round with heightened caution" tags="" position="700,1150" size="100,100">In the next room, you see a mirror, but instead of your reflection, it shows Bubba, trapped in a cage, reaching out to you with pleading eyes.

“Em! Help, please…”

Syther appears at your shoulder, breathing in deeply as if savoring your discomfort. “Ooh, this is my favorite part! So, what will it be? Rescue your precious little friend and go back to square one, or leave him to stew and win your game.”

Your heart clenches. Is this real, or just another trick?

[[Empathy, 40, You reach out, hoping to sense if this is truly Bubba. Fail: You strain yourself, leaving you dizzy, as Syther giggles over your doubt. -&gt; Try to verify if Bubba is real]]

Determined, you shatter the mirror, and Bubba stumbles free, gasping in relief.

“Oh, isn’t that adorable?” Syther sneers. “But it’ll cost you.”

The ground beneath shifts, sending you back to the game board, but you can’t help but feel it was worth it.

[[Return to the game board, ready to face Syther’s next round-&gt;Prepare for the next challenge with renewed resolve]]

“To win, reach the center,” he says with glee, his voice shifting from soft whispers to loud shouts. “Or… let them take you. I don’t mind either way!”

The path splits into three directions, each seeming more treacherous than the last.

[[Swordsgirlship, 45, You summon a blade, ready to cut through the beasts. Fail: You’re overwhelmed, narrowly escaping as Syther howls in laughter. -&gt; Take the right path, weapon in hand]]

Bubba’s cries echo as you walk forward, and Syther cackles wildly, clapping his hands.

“Ooh, I like this version of you! Cold-hearted Em, marching forward!”

The scene melts away, leaving you feeling numb but resolute.

[[Advance to the next round, ignoring the taunts of Syther-&gt;Enter the next room with unwavering focus]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Enter the next room with unwavering focus" tags="" position="700,1550" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name=" Take the right path, weapon in hand" tags="" position="325,1525" size="100,100">With a weapon in hand, you hack through the snarling beasts, emerging battered but victorious at the maze’s heart. Syther’s grin drops, replaced by a furious snarl.

“You think you can leave?” he screeches, but the labyrinth dissolves around you, freeing you back to reality. Bubba greets you in the camper, relieved.

“Good to see you again, Em,” he says with a tired smile. You give a nod, grateful it’s over.

“No! NO!” he shouts as his world collapses. You’re back in the camper, Bubba beside you, as Syther’s screams fade into silence.

Bubba smiles. “Glad you’re back, Em.”

The labyrinth crumbles, and suddenly, you’re free, back in the camper with Bubba.

“That was… something,” Bubba says with a nervous chuckle. You just sigh, relieved.

The sky is a static gray, and half-buried, twisted metal sculptures dot the landscape. A flickering sign reads: Welcome to NuCity Nexus - High-Speed Repairs Available!

Just as you’re about to joke about the irony, a gleaming figure steps forward from behind a busted metal column. It’s an android, its eyes pulsing red as it sizes you up. Bubba mutters, “That thing looks like it’s seen better days.”

You notice that it’s holding a laser tool and doesn’t look friendly.

This time, you focus on the android’s exposed joints and weak spots rather than its core. You move in swiftly, striking a key joint in its arm. The android’s movements slow, and its laser tool sputters out.

Seizing the moment, you dismantle a few crucial bolts, loosening the joints on its legs. The android falters, sparking as it tries to maintain its balance. With one last whir of its motor, it collapses to the ground, immobilized.

 You and Bubba exchange a relieved nod, leaving the now-harmless android behind as you quickly head back to the safety of the camper.

You mirror it slowly, hoping to ease its tension. The android pauses, its eyes flickering from red to a soft blue, as if your actions are reaching some dormant part of its programming.

The android’s posture shifts, and a series of tones beep softly, as if it’s trying to communicate. It lowers its laser tool and extends its hand, mimicking a handshake. You cautiously extend your hand to meet its metal fingers, feeling the cool touch of alloy.

The android seems pacified and steps back, allowing you and Bubba to continue on your way. You both share a look of amazement, wondering if you’ve just made a metallic ally.

Today, however, something is different. Bubba has been unusually quiet, and his usual mischievous grin is missing. You notice his brow furrowed in thought, his gaze distant.

&quot;Bubba, what’s going on?&quot; you ask, your voice full of concern. &quot;You’ve been out of it all day.&quot;

He looks at you, then sighs deeply. &quot;Em, there’s something I need to tell you. Something that’s been eating at me for a long time. I think I found him.&quot;

&quot;Found who?&quot;

&quot;My son,&quot; Bubba mutters, almost as if he’s still processing it himself. &quot;The kid I never knew I had.&quot;

You blink, confused. &quot;But, Bubba… you never had a son.&quot;

He nods slowly. &quot;I didn’t know. I didn’t remember. It all started when I got infected with the Antichrist Virus. It messed me up in ways I didn’t fully understand, and… well, it seems like I conceived him during that time.&quot;

You feel a chill run through you as the weight of his words sink in. &quot;The Antichrist Virus?&quot; you echo, horror creeping into your voice. &quot;That virus causes people to become vessels for the Antichrist…&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Bubba says grimly. &quot;And now my son… he’s the Antichrist. I need to find him. He’s out there, and I’m not sure what kind of person he’s become.&quot; His voice trembles with a mixture of fear and guilt. &quot;I don’t know if I can stop it. But I have to try.&quot;

You stand in silence for a moment, the gravity of the situation settling over both of you. The Antichrist—Bubba’s own son. What kind of danger does this kid pose to the multiverse?

&quot;Alright, Bubba. We’ll find him. We’ve dealt with worse,&quot; you say, steeling yourself for the journey ahead.

&quot;Thanks, Em,&quot; Bubba says quietly. &quot;Let’s go.&quot;

[[Search for clues about the Antichrist son’s whereabouts]] [[Ask Bubba for more details about the virus and his son]] [[Head toward the nearest town to ask around]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Search for clues about the Antichrist son’s whereabouts" tags="" position="400,525" size="100,100">You and Bubba decide to head out and search for any signs that could lead to Bubba’s son. Using your combined knowledge of the multiverse, you begin gathering information, visiting places where you suspect the Antichrist might be hiding.

Bubba seems distant, his mind somewhere else. His determination to find his son, even knowing the dangerous implications of this, makes you uneasy. What if his son is already too powerful? What if Bubba’s presence makes things worse?

You pass through a darkened alleyway, and Bubba stops suddenly, his eyes scanning the surroundings. &quot;This is where I found a lead. A cult… they said they were ‘waiting for the birth of the Antichrist.’&quot;

[[history, 50, You recognize the cult’s symbols, which could lead you to the Antichrist&#39;s location-&gt;Follow the lead]] [[observation, 40, You sense something is off about the cult-&gt;Confront them about their intentions]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Ask Bubba for more details about the virus and his son" tags="" position="525,525" size="100,100">You turn to Bubba, wanting to know more about the virus and the effects it had on him. “You’ve got to tell me everything you know. I can’t help you if I don’t understand what’s going on.”

Bubba nods and takes a deep breath. “The virus isn’t like anything you’ve seen. It infected me when I got into a rough spot in a backwater dimension. I had no idea what it was until… well, after I found out I was pregnant. I didn’t know what the hell was going on. The virus made me think it was a normal pregnancy. But something in me shifted. It was more than just a virus—it was a curse.”

You shudder, the thought of Bubba carrying the Antichrist inside him almost too much to comprehend.

“Where is he now, Bubba?” you ask gently.

Bubba rubs his eyes. “I don’t know. He might be out there, trying to find me, or… he could be under the influence of someone far worse. That virus—it’s not just about birth. It gives the host powers. He’s dangerous, Em. We need to find him before he finds us.”

Bubba has a hunch that there might be some information waiting for you there. Maybe someone has seen a young man with unusual abilities, or perhaps the cult he mentioned has spread its influence there.

As you arrive in town, you notice strange things happening. People are whispering, eyes darting nervously as you pass by. A faint but unsettling energy fills the air. There’s something wrong about this town, something that doesn’t sit right with you.

You approach a local bar, hoping to overhear something useful. As you walk in, a strange hush falls over the patrons. Someone in the back booth gestures you over.

&quot;Looking for something, stranger?&quot; the man asks with a knowing smirk.

The cult leader grins, revealing sharp teeth. &quot;Ah, the father. You didn’t know what you were carrying, did you?&quot; His voice is both mocking and reverent. &quot;Your son is destined to reshape the world. He will bring about the final days and the rise of the new order.&quot;

You feel a surge of unease, but you stand your ground. “Where is he? What have you done to him?”

However, the future is uncertain. Bubba’s son may be free of the virus, but the shadow of his past will always linger.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Passaggio senza titolo 3" tags="" position="850,900" size="100,100">As you and Bubba reach the final destination, the place where the cult has hidden Bubba’s son, you are met with a horrific sight. The once innocent child Bubba might have imagined is now fully transformed. His eyes glow with an unnatural light, his body surrounded by an aura of power that feels both ancient and terrifying. The energy in the air is suffocating, like the very fabric of reality is bending under the weight of his presence.

Bubba steps forward, calling out to his son with a voice filled with desperation and guilt. &quot;Son, I— I never knew, but I’m here now! Please, don’t let them control you!&quot;

For a moment, it seems like Bubba’s words might reach him. His son’s glowing eyes flicker, and the chaos around them seems to quiet for just a heartbeat. But then, without warning, the Antichrist’s influence snaps back, and the child’s expression hardens.

&quot;I don’t need your redemption, Father,&quot; the Antichrist’s voice echoes, cold and full of disdain. &quot;I am no longer the child you knew. You’re too late.&quot;

In a flash of unbearable light, the room grows darker, as the power from the child surges, ripping the cultists apart, disintegrating their bodies in an instant. Bubba stands frozen, unable to move, his heart breaking at the loss of what could have been. His son—his flesh and blood—has fully embraced the darkness.

“Goodbye, Father,” the Antichrist whispers, and with a wave of his hand, he sends Bubba crashing to the ground, paralyzed.

You rush to Bubba’s side, but it’s too late. The son he tried to save has become something unrecognizable, and Bubba’s broken expression says it all. He’s lost his son, not just to the virus, but to the darkness within himself. The emotional weight of this moment crushes Bubba, and all he can do is whisper, &quot;I should’ve known... I should’ve been there...&quot;

You look up, eyes wide with disbelief, as the Antichrist vanishes into the shadows, leaving nothing but a trail of destruction in his wake.

The world will be different now. You and Bubba are left standing in the ruins, the echoes of what could have been ringing in your ears. Bubba turns to you, his face a mask of regret and sorrow.

“I failed him. I failed you, Em,” Bubba says, his voice thick with grief. “He’s gone. The son I had... he’s not the same anymore. I thought I could change things, but it was too late.”

You try to comfort him, but there are no words that can ease the wound. Bubba lost his son to a fate worse than death, and there is no coming back from this.

You return to the camper, the weight of what happened hanging heavily in the air. The world may have been saved from the rise of the Antichrist for now, but Bubba’s heartbreak will never heal. Neither of you will forget the child that was lost, and the truth that will haunt both of you for the rest of your lives.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>

The air hums with a familiar but deeply annoying tune—the tune of Desaparecido, an infamously catchy Spanish song that somehow worms its way into every timeline, dimension, and reality.

A booming voice echoes in the distance, and you realize it’s the voice of the Archivist of All Songs, a mysterious being who oversees the creation and preservation of music across universes. &quot;Em, Desaparecido is an infection, a melody that once it begins, finds ways to persist eternally across worlds. Your task: destroy it. Erase it from every timeline.”

You grimace. You’ve always disliked Desaparecido, with its irritating lyrics and relentless rhythm. But this will be no small task. The Archivist hands you a silver baton—the Tempo Terminator, a powerful artifact that can erase sound patterns from existence.

Time to end this.

She’s humming the first few lines of Desaparecido, preparing to record the song that will soon infect countless universes.

But once it entered the collective subconscious, it grew. People began dreaming of it, writing it in different forms, never realizing it already existed elsewhere. It’s like an echo that won’t stop bouncing, an earworm that transcends time.”

The Archivist points at the silver baton. “You’ll need the Tempo Terminator. But be warned—each timeline will pose a different challenge, as Desaparecido evolves to survive.”

The hum of conveyor belts and the faint smell of glue fill the air. Bubba is already looking around with a glazed expression, clearly regretting his excitement about this “factory adventure.”

“Welcome to Krafthaven Packaging,” says the tour guide, a man in a monotone suit, with a matching monotone voice. “Today, you’ll witness the complete life cycle of a cardboard box—from raw materials to final product.”

He gestures for you to follow, and you and Bubba shuffle along with the small group of visitors.

The guide explains each step with great detail—too much detail, in fact, as he lists every mechanical part and function.

Bubba sighs, slumping against you. “Em, is this… it?” he whispers, barely hiding his disappointment.

You nod. “Seems like it, Bubba. It’s just cardboard.”

Bubba rolls his eyes, muttering, “I think my brain is turning to cardboard, Em.”

You stifle a yawn. “Almost over, Bubba. Almost over.”

As you head toward the camper, Bubba looks up at you with a tired smile. “So… that was definitely… something.”

You chuckle. “Yep. Definitely a thrill.”

With a mutual sigh of relief, you both climb into the camper, leaving the factory—and its endless rows of boxes—behind.

You notice a small pamphlet with a golden cross on the front. “What’s that, Bubba?” you ask, raising an eyebrow.

Bubba shifts uncomfortably in the driver’s seat. “Well, Em, it’s an offer. They want me to become a mail-in priest. You know, like a Protestant kind of deal. I can bless people, send them prayers, all by mail. It’s all pretty official and legit!”

You blink, trying to process what Bubba just said. A mail-in priest? You’ve heard of some strange jobs in your travels, but this might just take the cake.

[[Read the phamplet]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Read the phamplet" tags="" position="325,400" size="100,100">The pamphlet details a program that certifies individuals to become &quot;Protestant Mail-In Priests&quot; who can perform blessings, prayers, and even “virtual baptisms.” The catch is that all services are rendered via letters and correspondence. Bubba’s intrigued, but he seems uncertain whether this is a path he should take.

[[exploration, 15, You look over Bubba’s shoulder to better understand the pamphlet. You spot a curious sentence hidden under a layer of gold leaf: “Only those who truly seek will be blessed.” -&gt; Investigate the pamphlet further to see if there&#39;s something important hidden]]

The fine print talks about “the real blessings coming from within” and how the recipient must “fulfill the mandate of faith” for their prayers to be answered. You can’t help but wonder if this is a scam—or a weirdly structured cult.

[[cryptography, 30, You take out your glasses and study the tiny print in detail, looking for any hidden meaning in the message. -&gt; You decipher the pamphlet, noticing a hidden clause that seems to suggest something is off about the whole process]]

[[diplomacy, 35, You reassure Bubba by highlighting how this is a low-risk venture, where he can help others without too much personal sacrifice. He could try it out and see where it goes. -&gt; Convince Bubba that a short trial run as a mail-in priest would be a good way to test the waters]]

Fake bistros line the streets, and cardboard cutouts of &quot;locals&quot; pose with stiff berets and striped shirts. Bubba sniffs the air, catching the distinct aroma of… cardboard? Mixed with something slimy and salty.

“Welcome to ‘France,’” a cutout labeled Tour Guide says, a speech bubble popping up with instructions: Try the famous escargot!

A little stand with painted slugs on the menu stands before you. Bubba raises an eyebrow. “Guess we’re doing this?”

You notice some cardboard townsfolk pointing at the slugs with exaggerated cartoonish smiles.

Bubba peers closer, grinning. &quot;Think it&#39;s a challenge?&quot;

You feel the world around you blur, the streets of Cardboard Paris warping, colors bleeding together like watercolors in the rain.

Bubba’s laughter fades into a worried murmur. “Em? You alright there?”

Your vision swims, and for a moment, you see something beyond Cardboard Paris—a dark, endless void, pulsing with the same bizarre, fleshy texture as the NOTHING. The pain sharpens, twisting your insides. You double over, clutching your stomach, but the burning doesn’t stop; it spreads, as if it’s consuming you from the inside.

As it falls to the ground with a sickening squelch, the world seems to right itself, though your stomach remains unsettled.

Bubba looks at you with a bemused grin, his cowboy hat tilted slightly as he leans against the camper. &quot;You alright there, Em? You look like you&#39;ve seen a ghost.&quot; You shake your head, wiping your mouth and trying to clear the dizziness. &quot;That NOTHING wasn&#39;t what it seemed.&quot; Bubba chuckles and pats your back as you stumble into the camper. &quot;Well, let&#39;s get on the road before we end up attracting more trouble.&quot; The liminal engine whirs to life as the camper lurches forward, leaving the strange town behind, the world ahead ripe with more mysteries. 

You settle into the seat, the nagging feeling of something amiss still lingering, but Bubba’s easygoing presence helps you push it aside. There’s always something new waiting on the other side of the next dimension.

The structure sways slightly in the breeze, but that only adds to the challenge. You grip one of the steel bars, surprised to find it warm, almost like living skin. Bubba barks a word of encouragement from below as you begin to climb, each step bringing you closer to the top. Halfway up, you spot a platform where a small, rusted telescope is mounted, aimed at the sky.

[[Peer through the telescope]]

At first, all you see are streaks and smudges, but then the image sharpens. Instead of a normal view, the telescope seems to be peering into a different world—a swirling, otherworldly city where enormous floating eyes drift lazily through purple clouds. Just as you’re about to pull back, one of the eyes seems to look directly at you, blinking slowly.

[[Wave at the eye]]

When you finally reach the peak, you’re greeted by an unexpected sight—a nest of iridescent, shimmering eggs nestled in the metal bars. They emit a soft hum, like a tiny chorus. Each egg seems to pulse gently, as if something inside is responding to your presence.

[[Inspect the eggs more closely]]
[[Leave the eggs undisturbed and climb back down]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Wave at the eye" tags="" position="650,550" size="100,100">You give the floating eye a friendly wave.

A strange warmth settles over you, and you feel as if something—or someone—is now watching over you, almost like a protective presence. You pull back from the telescope, feeling a strange sense of comfort.

 You climb back down, feeling lighter, as if the universe has given you a friendly nod. As you reach the ground, Bubba tilts his head at you, sensing the change in your energy.

As you reach out to touch one, it shudders under your hand, and a thin crack appears. Slowly, a tiny creature, a mixture of snail and firefly, emerges, blinking up at you with wide, curious eyes. It lets out a soft chime, like a tiny bell.

The creature flutters to your shoulder, glowing softly. You carefully make your way back down, your new companion illuminating the way. Bubba waits at the bottom, leaning against the camper, a satisfied smile on his face. As you approach, the creature on your shoulder chirps, catching Bubba’s attention. He grins, tipping his cowboy hat. “Well, look at that, Em. Looks like we got ourselves a little friend.” With a hearty laugh, he pats the camper’s side and heads inside. The engine hums to life, the liminal engine crackling with energy, as the two of you set off, the flickering glow of the creature accompanying you into the unknown.

Carefully, you start your descent, glancing back to see the shimmering nest receding into the distance.

 Back on the ground, you feel a subtle sense of reverence for the mysteries of this world. Bubba stands beside the camper, gazing up at you, his expression unreadable. “You know, Em,” he says, as you approach, “sometimes the best thing to do is just leave things as they are.”

Bubba pauses mid-bite, his eyes narrowing as he processes the flavor. &quot;This tastes like... like something I&#39;ve never had before,&quot; he mutters. You grin, secretly pleased with yourself. The flavors are bold and comforting, with just the right balance of spice. &quot;I think it&#39;s a hit,&quot; you reply, and Bubba nods enthusiastically, finishing his bowl. As you both relax and savor the meal, the camper hums along the road, taking you further from the strange town.

As you clean up, Bubba’s laughter is contagious, and for the moment, the strange world around you feels a little more familiar.

“Oh, Em,” he chokes, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “That tastes like somethin’ that crawled out of the swamp, took a bath in skunk oil, and called itself dinner!”

You glance down at the skillet, where the slugs sit in a murky, gelatinous pool. The smell hits you—sharp, sour, and somehow damp—and suddenly you’re not sure how you managed to take a bite yourself.

Bubba chuckles, recovering. “Well, I reckon not every dish can be a winner. Guess even magic has its limits, huh?”

You both share a relieved laugh, pushing the skillet away. The camper hums back to life, and the two of you continue down the winding road, stomachs growling and a little wiser about the perils of experimental cuisine in strange worlds.

You see fleeting images of places you’ve never been—underwater forests, skies filled with floating islands, deserts made of glass.

Bubba waves a hand in front of your face. “Em, you with me?”

A strange calm washes over you as you focus on the subtle whispers of the slug’s memories. You can sense the depth of the worlds it has traveled through—places that twist and defy logic, ruled by unknown forces, touched by strange magic. The memories are fragmented, like shards of a dream, but you can feel them pressing into your soul, leaving a cold, unsettling knowledge behind.

End: The slug seems to settle on your palm, its soft glow flickering as you absorb its tale. Bubba watches you with concern, his eyes narrowing as he steps closer. “What’s goin’ on in that head of yours, Em?” he asks, his voice serious. You blink, the strange images in your mind beginning to fade, but the weight of them lingers. “It’s… hard to explain,” you reply, feeling a mix of awe and unease. Bubba nods knowingly, his grin returning. “Well, we’ll figure it out on the road, like always.” He opens the camper door, and you both climb inside. The liminal engine hums as you drive away, the weight of the slug’s tale still in your mind. Whatever it showed you, there’s no turning back now, and the road ahead promises more revelations in strange and unfamiliar places.

A tiny shop emerges at the end of the alley with a crudely painted sign that reads, &quot;Les Curiosités Mouvantes&quot;—The Moving Curiosities.

Bubba steps inside with you, his eyes lighting up as he points at a display of “moving” trinkets. Tiny cardboard clocks tick on the shelves, their hands twitching and spinning in random directions. Among the bizarre items, you notice an odd artifact: a cardboard orb painted to look like a swirling galaxy.

You reach for it, and as you touch it, the galaxy inside shifts, like it’s truly alive.

“Ah, mademoiselle, monsieur! You look like people of exquisite taste! I am Pierre, purveyor of the finest wares in all of Cardboard Paris!” His voice is cartoonishly thick with a faux French accent.

Bubba chuckles, leaning over to whisper, “Betcha he’s got some hidden treasures here.”

Pierre winks dramatically, gesturing to his table filled with a mix of peculiar items: small chinese boxes, a string of goblin ears, and a potion bottle filled with glittery liquid labeled “Essence of the Eiffel.”

A subtle voice, barely more than a whisper, begins to echo from within the orb. “Cardboard Paris is… a dream,” it says, “a half-finished thought suspended between realms.” The swirling galaxies inside the orb shimmer, giving off images that flicker and fade as quickly as they appear. You glimpse a workshop of sorts, cluttered with sketches and fragments of cardboard prototypes. Strange, shadowy hands move deftly, assembling buildings, figures, even the Eiffel Tower itself.

“It was created by… a Forgotten Architect,” the voice continues. “This world was meant to be a perfect model city, a timeless vision. But something—something went wrong.”

The orb grows warm in your hands, and a vision fills your mind. You see the Architect as a shadowy figure surrounded by endless stacks of cardboard, each piece meticulously crafted. They worked tirelessly, creating Paris over and over, but every time they completed it, the city collapsed, unable to withstand the weight of its own illusion. So, they abandoned it, leaving behind this unfinished realm, trapped between dream and reality.

Bubba, watching you with a puzzled but intrigued expression, asks, “So this whole place—it’s just leftovers from some... cardboard architect?”

You nod, still holding the orb as it fades back to its inert state. “It’s a place that was never meant to be complete,” you murmur, feeling a strange sympathy for this strange, fragile world.

The light dances within the gem, almost like a heartbeat, drawing you closer.

Pierre’s eyes narrow slightly as he sees your interest. “Ah, mademoiselle has a discerning eye! That is no ordinary pendant. They say it holds a piece of the real Eiffel Tower’s magic, eh?” He leans closer, whispering theatrically, “A true collector’s item.”

You can sense a faint magic pulsing from it, distinct from the shallow enchantments on the other “treasures.” Something about it feels real.

Bubba grins. “You found somethin’ good there, Em?”

[[intuition, 25, You sense something off about Pierre’s story -&gt; Question him about the pendant]]

This here Essence of the Eiffel looks like it came straight out of a kid&#39;s glitter stash. I think you could do better.”

Pierre gasps dramatically, his paper mustache drooping. “Mademoiselle! Sacrebleu! This is a rare Parisian elixir! But... for you, perhaps a discount. Just this once.”

He lowers the price to half of whatever the imaginary currency is in Cardboard Paris. Bubba leans in, grinning. “I reckon we’ve just out-bargained a cardboard Frenchman. Now that’s somethin’ I didn’t think I’d do today.”

You tuck the potion bottle into your bag with a grin, and Bubba pats you on the shoulder as you both head back toward the camper. As the Eiffel Tower leans in the distance, you can’t help but feel you’ve left a bit of magic in Cardboard Paris—a place that was always meant to be a surreal, fleeting dream.

Bubba’s voice calls faintly behind, but it’s quickly swallowed by the thickening fog around you. The shadowy figure moves deeper into the maze of Cardboard Paris, always just out of reach. You follow, hypnotized, compelled by a force you can&#39;t explain. You feel the air grow colder, and the walls close in, the world reshaping itself like cardboard folding inward, trapping you within.

The galaxy in the orb dims, and for a moment, the entire world feels hazy, as if you’re viewing it from the bottom of a murky pool.
The presence is still there.

For the first time, you see a faint glint of eyes under the hood—empty, hollow eyes that seem to absorb the light itself. The figure smiles, an unsettling grin. “You wanted to know the secrets of Cardboard Paris?” it whispers, voice like paper crinkling. &quot;Now, you are a part of it.&quot;

In an instant, your body feels stiff, your limbs freezing in place. You try to move, but your skin feels coarse and rough. You look down and see your fingers flattening, transforming into paper, the texture turning into cardboard. The world around you fades as you become part of this half-real city, forever locked in a frozen, unfinished dream.

He raises an eyebrow but shrugs, taking another bite of NOTHING himself. But as he does, a glint of realization flashes in his eyes, and his smile fades. “Wait… Em, that ain’t right.”

Before you can reply, the ground below you begins to tremble. The world around you starts collapsing, the painted shops peeling away, the cardboard Eiffel Tower crumbling into dust. You stumble, clutching Bubba’s arm as the NOTHING inside you surges, a growing blackness.

The last thing you see is Bubba reaching out to you, eyes filled with panic and helplessness as the dark flames of the NOTHING consume you both.

That sounds… unlikely. What’s the real story here?”

Pierre’s smile falters, and a strange glint appears in his eye. “Ah, you are sharp, mademoiselle. I did not expect you to be quite so… inquisitive.” His accent slips, his voice turning low and almost growling.

The cardboard figure’s paper features twist, and for a moment, you glimpse a darkness beneath—a flickering shadow looking back at you with a chilling intensity. “I see you are not as naive as most travelers to Cardboard Paris.”

He steps back, melding into the shadow, but his voice lingers. “Be careful with that pendant, Em. It remembers its true owner… and they might just come looking.”

The warm glow intensifies as you study it, a faint golden light spreading over your fingers.

Suddenly, a vision flashes through your mind—scenes of an ancient workshop, the silhouette of a hooded figure hunched over the very pendant in your hands. You feel a rush of history and power, as if the pendant contains a piece of some grand mystery.

But as you pull back, Pierre’s face darkens. “Ah, mademoiselle,” he says with an edge to his tone, “perhaps you look too closely.”

The air grows tense as Pierre’s form flickers, revealing a deeper shadow beneath his paper exterior. You realize, too late, that something otherworldly is watching you through him.

The sweet aroma is promising, but there’s an underlying, almost metallic tang that reminds you of the potion mishaps back in Witch School. You steel yourself, spearing one slug and lifting it to your mouth.

As you take the first bite, the flavor is...confusing. There’s a burst of sweetness, but it quickly turns sour, with a sharp, prickly aftertaste that stings the back of your throat. The slug’s texture is oddly rubbery, springing back against your teeth.

Bubba raises an eyebrow, his grin fading. “Uh, that good, huh?”

You force a smile, swallowing with effort. “Well, it’s...unique.”</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>

CRACK.

Pain shoots through your arm, and your elbow swells up instantly. You let out a yelp, clutching your arm as the aching throb overtakes your senses. Bubba’s ears perk up, and he trots over, concern in his eyes.

Bubba’s reaction: &quot;See, Em? I told you! Why didn’t you just let it go?&quot;

You open your mouth to explain, then think better of it and just mutter, “An experiment went wrong.” The healer shrugs, applies a glowing ointment, and mutters a minor healing spell over your elbow.

Healer’s advice: &quot;Perhaps next time, try a simpler spell if you’re that curious about body-bending magic. And maybe… avoid tongue-elbow experiments.&quot;

Bubba looks at her with a raised eyebrow, then surveys the kaleidoscope of shapes and patterns in the air. He scratches his chin thoughtfully, the corners of his mouth twitching as if he’s trying to decide if he’s playing along or genuinely unsure.

“You’re not alone, Em,” Bubba says with a grin, his voice calm and steady. “I see it too. But I gotta say, I think this is one of the more colorful trips we&#39;ve had.&quot;

Bubba’s ears perk up as he lifts his head, but his usual relaxed demeanor vanishes when the world outside starts to warp. The road ahead twists unnaturally, like a ribbon pulling itself into knots.

“What the—?” You slam the brakes, but it’s too late. The entire landscape melts, shifting from one bizarre scene to another, until you&#39;re surrounded by a fog so thick it feels alive.

The camper shudders to a stop, but the world around you doesn’t. Strange, vaporous tendrils snake out from the fog, slithering across the ground like some primordial creature searching for prey.

&quot;Em... this ain&#39;t right,&quot; Bubba mutters, his fur bristling. You glance out the window and realize you can’t see more than a few feet beyond the camper.

Suddenly, you hear a voice—faint but growing louder.

“You should not have come here…” it whispers, as if the wind itself is speaking. The air thickens with a scent of something bitter—like burning herbs and rotten fruit.

Your fingers move over your spellbook, muttering the incantations as your breath quickens. The fog presses closer, but you focus, channeling your magic.

With a sharp word, a barrier of shimmering light surrounds the camper, and the fog seems to recoil, as if it can’t touch you anymore. The voices fall silent, and the oppressive air lightens. Bubba watches, his tail flicking in nervous anticipation.

“You did it,” Bubba says, a breath of relief escaping his lips. &quot;I knew you&#39;d figure it out.&quot;

You continue driving, the fog eventually dissipating, leaving you with nothing but the eerie silence of the strange world behind you. You keep the magic strong, just in case, but the air now feels… less alive, less oppressive.

You breathe deeply, glancing at Bubba. “That was too close. Let&#39;s keep moving. I don&#39;t know what that place was, but I don&#39;t want to see it again.”

[[Continue...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Neutral Ending" tags="" position="625,375" size="100,100">You take a deep breath, your heart pounding. “We need to see what’s going on. If we’re stuck here, we’ll never know until we try.”

Bubba growls lowly, clearly nervous. “You sure about this, Em?”

You nod, gripping the door handle. The moment your foot touches the ground, the fog presses in around you, dense and heavy. Shapes loom just out of the corner of your vision—shifting, twisting, and whispering. Your mind races, memories of datura trips and hallucinations flashing before your eyes, but this feels so much worse. The whispers grow louder, as if the fog is speaking directly into your brain.

A sudden burst of movement catches your eye—a figure in the mist, a face with eyes too large for its head, staring directly at you. You freeze, heart thumping painfully in your chest.

The figure doesn’t move, but you feel the air grow colder, more oppressive. You back away slowly, returning to the camper. Bubba’s eyes are wide, a mix of confusion and fear.

“Yeah, no more of that,” he says, growling. &quot;Let&#39;s just leave, Em. We can&#39;t stick around here.&quot;

The camper lurches as you hit the gas, driving off, but you can still feel the weight of the fog clinging to your skin.

Lock the doors!&quot; you shout, slamming the camper doors shut. Bubba follows your command, his paws scrambling for the locks, but the fog outside presses up against the windows, as though it’s searching for a way in.

The air grows thick, suffocating, and every time you try to breathe, it feels like the fog is filling your lungs. The whispers grow louder, more insistent, their words now unmistakable: “Leave... or become part of us...”

Suddenly, the camper lurches, as if the ground itself is pulling it under. The walls creak, and for a terrifying moment, you’re sure the entire vehicle will collapse. Bubba’s growls turn to whimpers as the fog curls around the camper like a serpent, pulling you deeper into its suffocating grip.

With one final screech of metal, the camper stalls, leaving you both trapped in the thickening fog. The last thing you hear is a whisper in your ear, a promise: &quot;You are ours now.&quot;

You glance over at him as he lazily lounges in the backseat, puffing away at yet another cigar.

“Bubba,” you start, voice low, “Do you ever think about Beagle? You know, the city we’re heading to?”

Bubba blows out a cloud of smoke, his eyes half-lidded. He doesn’t seem to hear you at first, but then he looks over at you with a slow, puzzled expression.

“Beagle?” he repeats, flicking the ash from his cigar. “Yeah… sure. I mean, yeah. I guess that’s where we’re going, right? But…” He trails off, looking out the window as if searching for something he can’t quite grasp. &quot;I dunno, Em. I can’t really remember much about it, y’know? It’s all foggy... like one of those... you know... datura seed trips. Lotta weird, twisting things that don’t make sense.”

You raise an eyebrow, not entirely surprised. &quot;What do you mean? You don’t remember anything at all?&quot;

Bubba shakes his head slowly, his gaze distant. “Nothin&#39; solid. Just flashes. Lots of smoke... and shadows… Some big, dark sky, with people who didn’t really have faces… and a lotta cigars. So many cigars.”

You stare at him, baffled. &quot;You mean, you remember nothing? Not even how we got here?&quot;

Bubba looks at you like he’s just come out of a trance. &quot;Oh, we’re in a camper, right? Well, that’s somethin’ at least.&quot;

You let out a sigh, unsure how to process it all. He’s just as lost in the haze as the rest of you. You start to wonder if you’ll ever really make it to Beagle at all, or if it&#39;s just another half-remembered dream.

Maybe we’ll figure it out when we get there.”

Bubba nods slowly, content to smoke in silence. The road stretches on ahead, and though the destination is uncertain, you feel oddly calm. Some things are just better left to the journey, especially with Bubba at your side.

The camper rolls on, and for the first time, you’re not as worried about Beagle—whatever it is.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Neutral Ending" tags="" position="625,375" size="100,100">You press on, trying to help Bubba remember more. “Come on, Bubba. Think harder. What else do you remember about Beagle? Anything?”

Bubba closes his eyes for a moment, trying to concentrate, but then shakes his head again. “Nah. It’s like… like a dream that slips away every time I try to hold on to it. All I know is… cigars. Everywhere. And some kinda clock. But I can’t figure out what it means.”

Frustrated but not surprised, you let the conversation die out. At least you’ve learned that, despite everything, Bubba is as mysterious as ever. You continue your journey in silence, both of you lost in your own thoughts as the camper hums down the road toward the unknown.

Bubba blinks at you, confused. “Hey, Em, relax. I’m just tryin’ to enjoy the ride, y’know? I told you, it’s all just a haze.”

Frustrated, you grab the cigar from his mouth and toss it out the window. &quot;Enough of this. You&#39;re acting like you&#39;re in some kind of trance!&quot;

Bubba’s tail flicks in agitation. “Hey, hey! What the heck is wrong with you?” he growls. “You know I can’t help it. Just let me be.”

The mood sours, and now even the road ahead seems darker. Tension fills the air as you both settle into an uncomfortable silence, neither of you feeling any closer to Beagle—or each other.

The goblins have set up makeshift barriers of junk and scrap metal, cackling as they spot you and Bubba in the camper.

After several loud knocks and dents, you manage to escape, but not without sustaining some damage to the camper—and your pride.

The archway is covered in mysterious runes, and large, iron doors stand ominously ajar. The structure is ancient, weathered, but clearly designed to impress, its sheer size and design suggesting that whatever lies beyond must be of great importance.

A deep, cold wind flows from the opening, sending a shiver down your spine. Bubba growls softly, his hackles raised. You feel a pull of curiosity. This might be the entrance to something truly significant.

&quot;Let’s see what’s inside, Bubba,&quot; you mutter, pushing forward through the thick vines and stepping through the threshold.
[[Examine the runes carefully before entering-&gt;Good Ending]]

The symbols, when deciphered, reveal a warning—this dungeon was once meant to test a great hero, but its purpose was lost over time. With this newfound knowledge, you proceed cautiously, ready for whatever comes next.

As you step through the archway, the grand stone doors creak shut behind you. The floor opens up into a surprisingly small, humble stone room. The only thing inside is a single pedestal with a dusty old tome resting on it. Bubba sniffs around, clearly unimpressed. The tome, when opened, reveals that it’s a simple guide on how to brew basic potions. You feel slightly deflated by the underwhelming discovery, but at least you gained some useful knowledge.
[[Continue...]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Neutral Ending" tags="" position="625,375" size="100,100">You step forward without hesitation, the anticipation rising in your chest. The stone doors shut behind you with a resounding thud, echoing through the empty space. As you make your way into the dungeon, the grandeur of the entrance quickly fades, and you find yourself in a small, simple stone room. The only feature is a chest in the center, covered in dust. You open it, only to find a handful of ancient coins and a few old scrolls that seem more decorative than useful. The dungeon’s impressive facade turns out to be nothing more than a glorified storage room.
[[Continue...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Bad Ending" tags="" position="750,375" size="100,100">You grow impatient, feeling the need to get inside and discover what this impressive dungeon holds. You decide to probe it with a quick spell to sense any magical energies lurking within. You channel your magic toward the entrance, but something goes wrong. The spell ricochets off the stone archway, creating a wave of energy that causes the ground to rumble beneath you. The doors slam shut with a thunderous crash, and you find yourself trapped inside.

The cavernous echo you’d expected to hear dies out quickly, revealing only a small, dank room. The walls are covered in moss, and the only thing inside is a large stone bowl with an old relic floating within. It’s a simple trinket, a mere bauble of little value. With frustration building, you realize the dungeon entrance was all show—and you’ve wasted both your time and energy on something far less exciting than you’d imagined.

Every step melts the ice beneath you, sending up puffs of steam, and the sun blazes down with unnatural intensity. Bubba pants, his tongue lolling in the oppressive heat, and you realize that staying here for long could be dangerous. You’ll need to act quickly to protect yourselves.

The spell takes hold, enveloping you in a refreshing, icy breeze that shields you from the blazing heat. Bubba perks up, relieved, and the two of you relax for a while, watching the shimmering landscape from your safe, cool spot. The harshness of the environment feels distant now as you enjoy the strange beauty around you.

Gathering Bubba close, you huddle beneath the ice spire, which does little to block the intense sunlight but provides enough of a break to keep you from overheating. The shade isn’t perfect, but it buys you time until the sun’s angle shifts, and the heat becomes a little more bearable.

The ice beneath the surface is even hotter than expected, and the melted water begins to burn your hands as you dig. Before long, steam rises around you, obscuring your vision. A sudden hiss sounds from below—a jet of superheated water bursts from the ground, forcing you and Bubba to leap back as the steam scalds your skin. The two of you stagger back, burned and exhausted, from your unsuccessful attempt.

Bubba is lying in the back, his usual calm demeanor a comforting presence. But as you glance into the side mirror to check your rearview, something feels… off.

The reflection in the mirror is no longer showing the road behind you. Instead, it&#39;s a dark, empty void—a swirling, black mist that seems to pulse ominously. You blink and check the other mirror, only to find the same thing: no road, no trees, just the empty, swirling void.

Bubba growls from the back, clearly sensing something strange. You feel a chill run up your spine.

It seems the mirrors had temporarily been affected by a magical anomaly, but with your spell, they&#39;ve returned to normal. Bubba relaxes, and you continue your journey, a little more cautious but confident in your ability to deal with such strange occurrences.

The strange void fades from view after a few moments, but you can’t quite shake the feeling that something is watching you through the glass. Bubba stays quiet, but you notice his ears perk up every so often, as though listening for something beyond the fog.

As you approach the mirrors, the black mist suddenly begins to seep out, twisting around you like fingers reaching for your soul. Bubba barks in alarm as the mist begins to pull at your feet, and before you can react, the mirrors crack open, releasing a dark, distorted version of your reflection—a grotesque, grinning version of yourself that steps out of the glass. You scramble back into the camper, slamming the door as the mist retreats, but you know now that the mirrors have become a dangerous gateway.

After coming across an obscure text on the history of enchanted garden gnomes in a dusty second-hand bookstore, you suddenly find yourself consumed with a new hyperfixation. You can’t think about anything else but finding out everything there is to know about these curious creatures. The book detailed their magical properties—how they can either protect your home or, in rare cases, act as tiny guardians of forbidden knowledge.

Bubba watches as you pour over the pages, your fingers tracing the illustrations of these gnomes with wild excitement. It’s only when you nearly knock over the coffee mug for the third time that you realize it’s time to take action. You need to find one—a real gnome.

&quot;Let’s go, Bubba,&quot; you say, standing up with determination. &quot;We’re going gnome hunting.&quot;
    [[Track down a rumored gnome collector in the next town-&gt;Neutral Ending]]

    [[Search the local woods for enchanted gnomes-&gt;Good Ending]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Good Ending" tags="" position="500,375" size="100,100">With nothing more than a rough map and a gut feeling, you head into the nearby woods, certain that somewhere out there, hidden among the trees, lies an enchanted gnome. Bubba growls quietly beside you, alert to the quiet rustle of leaves. You search for hours, pulling at vines and peering under fallen logs, until, finally, you spot something shiny peeking out from behind a large boulder.

It’s a small gnome, no taller than a foot, but its eyes glow faintly. As you approach, it doesn’t scurry away or vanish—it simply stands still, watching you curiously. You gently kneel, your heart racing, and ask it if it will join you. After a long moment, it gives a tiny nod, and you carefully lift it into your arms. You’ve found your first enchanted gnome, and it feels like a huge victory.

Bubba, despite his skepticism, seems intrigued. The gnome follows you back to the camper, sitting quietly by your side. You have a new companion now, one that’s both adorable and possibly a tiny protector.

[[Continue...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Neutral Ending" tags="" position="625,375" size="100,100">You head to the nearest town, following whispers of an eccentric collector who supposedly has a vast collection of enchanted gnomes. The journey is slow, and Bubba grows increasingly annoyed with your distracted ramblings about their magical abilities. When you finally meet the collector, they seem more amused by your enthusiasm than anything else. They show you their collection, but it turns out that most of the gnomes are just ordinary garden statues—no magic involved.

While you didn’t find anything extraordinary, you do leave with a small, somewhat enchanted gnome that the collector claims has a &quot;mild&quot; protective aura. Bubba isn’t impressed, but you’re already planning your next fixated pursuit. The gnome sits quietly in the corner of the camper, its glass eyes staring into the distance.

[[Continue...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Bad Ending" tags="" position="750,375" size="100,100">Eager to avoid the tiresome search for a real gnome, you decide to use magic to summon one instead. You gather your ingredients, muttering an incantation under your breath. The air around you shifts as the spell takes hold, and soon a small figure materializes—except it’s not quite what you were expecting.

The gnome that appears is nothing like the cute little creatures in the book. This one is made of sharp, jagged stone and seems incredibly... angry. It doesn’t look at all friendly. Before you can react, it begins to scurry around the camper, knocking things over and causing chaos. Bubba barks loudly, chasing after it, but the gnome evades him with surprising agility.

You struggle to contain the creature as it causes more and more damage, realizing too late that maybe you should have just stuck to finding one the old-fashioned way. The gnome finally disappears back into thin air, leaving behind a trail of destruction. Bubba sits down, exhausted, while you begin to clean up the mess.

You’ve been experimenting with some old tomes and a few discarded scientific journals that you scavenged along your travels, looking for new ways to combine magic and science. Bubba, as usual, lounges by your side, occasionally pawing at an old coffee mug that rolls off the table.

While idly flipping through a particularly bizarre manuscript on quantum mechanics and transdimensional mechanics, you stumble upon a strange phenomenon: particles that behave in an entirely unexpected way when subjected to magical energy. The more you ponder it, the more it makes sense. If you adjust the electromagnetic properties of a field just so, the particles begin to act in an oscillating pattern that defies known laws—creating a new force you dub &quot;Erratic Magnetic Oscillation&quot; or EMO. It’s as if magic and physics are now intertwined in a way no one has ever thought possible.

Excited, you conduct a few small experiments using some basic equipment you’ve scrounged together. The results are astounding. For the first time in history, magic and physics are acting in harmony, bending the rules of nature in a way no one could have predicted. You can&#39;t wait to share your findings with the world.

It doesn’t take long before you’re thrust into the spotlight as the scientist who dared to merge magic with physics.

A few weeks later, you receive an invitation to the Ig Nobel Prize ceremony, where your groundbreaking discovery is celebrated with the utmost enthusiasm. The announcement of your award is met with applause, and you accept the prize with a proud smile. The world may have laughed at your work at first, but now you’ve made history.

Bubba, your ever-loyal companion, walks beside you, keeping a wary eye on the crowd. You’ve tracked Kovač to a dilapidated building at the edge of the city, a likely hideout. According to your sources, he’s holed up inside, preparing to leave the country.

You take a deep breath, adjusting the camera strapped to your shoulder. You need to get to him before he vanishes again—and you need to find out everything he knows. The stakes are high.

[[Use your spiritism skills to sense his presence inside the building-&gt;Good Ending]]

[[Enter the building cautiously, trying to blend in with the crowd-&gt;Neutral Ending]]

[[Use a distraction spell to draw him out into the open-&gt;Bad Ending]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Good Ending" tags="" position="500,375" size="100,100">You focus your senses, channeling your spiritism magic to feel the subtle traces of Kovač&#39;s energy lingering in the building. A cold shiver runs down your spine as you detect a faint aura of aggression and fear within. You smile, knowing you’re on the right track.

You enter the building through a broken side door, moving swiftly and quietly. Your magical senses guide you through the crumbling halls until you find Kovač in a small, dimly lit room, packing a bag. He doesn’t hear you approach in time. Before he can react, you’re on him—your interrogation sharp and direct. He’s too shaken by your presence and the weight of the magic you wield to resist. Within minutes, you’ve got the information you need, and the police are en route to take him down.

The sound of the war outside still echoes in the distance, but your focus is solely on Kovač.

You make your way through the building, following the tips you’ve gathered from your sources. However, as you move deeper into the structure, it becomes clear that you’ve been followed. The moment you spot Kovač, he disappears into a dark hallway, slipping out of sight. You manage to follow him into a cramped room, but he’s already gone—vanishing into the shadows. He leaves behind only a cryptic note, an indication that your search isn’t over.
[[Continue...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Bad Ending" tags="" position="750,375" size="100,100">You decide to take a more direct approach, using a spell of confusion to create a distraction that will lure Kovač out into the open. You gather your energy and cast the spell, filling the area with a burst of disorienting magic. The chaos you’ve created is effective—too effective.

In the confusion, a group of armed men emerges, all with connections to Kovač. They catch you off guard, and before you can react, you’re surrounded. They’re not interested in interrogation, and soon you’re forced to retreat, leaving the building empty-handed and a bit worse for wear. The trail goes cold, and Kovač escapes once again.

Thunder rumbles in the distance, and water floods the ground as you and Bubba huddle inside, watching the storm grow stronger. There’s no end in sight, and the relentless rain begins to seep into the camper’s worn roof. You realize you’ll need to act quickly to protect yourselves and the camper from the deluge.

Choices:

    [[Cast a water-repelling spell-&gt;Good Ending]]

    [[Try to outrun the storm-&gt;Bad Ending]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Good Ending" tags="" position="500,375" size="100,100">You quickly mutter the words for a WaterRepel spell, focusing on forming a barrier around the camper. As the magic takes hold, the rain seems to part around you, leaving the camper and everything inside untouched by the storm. Bubba watches in awe as water beads and slides off the protective shield. The two of you wait out the downpour in dry comfort, even managing to brew some tea as thunder cracks around you.

[[Continue...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Neutral Ending" tags="" position="625,375" size="100,100">Grabbing a handful of buckets and an old tarp, you and Bubba do your best to keep the camper dry. You catch drips as they fall through the roof and patch what you can with the tarp, managing to prevent most of the water from soaking everything. Though the camper’s interior is a little damp and musty, you avoid major water damage. The storm eventually passes, leaving behind a misty, quiet evening.

[[Continue...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Bad Ending" tags="" position="750,375" size="100,100">Deciding you can outrun the storm, you throw open the driver’s door, slam into the seat, and gun the camper down the narrow, muddy road. But the storm is faster than you anticipated. The rain pounds down, reducing visibility, and the tires slip on the muddy road. Before you know it, the camper skids off the path, landing in a ditch. Water seeps in through the windows as you scramble to escape, leaving you and Bubba soaked and stranded as the rain pours down.

Bubba is napping in the back, his snores gentle but rhythmic. You idly flip through the radio channels, looking for something to occupy your mind. You pass through static-filled stations, and then—there’s a strange, almost haunting frequency.

You pause for a moment, intrigued by the odd hum coming from the speakers. The static crackles, and then—voices.

“...Yeah, I think I’ve just had enough of the whole dimension-hopping thing, Bubba. I mean, there’s only so many weird places you can visit before they all start to blend together, right?”

You freeze, recognizing your voice instantly. The conversation continues.

“You’re probably right,” Bubba’s voice follows, his tone just as familiar. “But what about Beagle? You sure you don’t want to make it there?”

It’s your conversation—last night. The radio seems to be replaying your discussion, word for word, as if it happened all over again.

The radio crackles, but then it clears up as a low, almost amused voice responds. “Is this... Em? Oh, so you finally caught on.”

Your heart races as you grip the wheel tighter. “What’s going on? How is this even possible?”

The voice laughs lightly. “You’d be surprised how easy it is to tap into your frequency. You’ve been asking the wrong questions all along.”

Just as quickly as it began, the radio goes silent. Bubba stirs in the backseat, looking at you quizzically.

&quot;Who was that?&quot; he asks, now fully awake.

You stare at the empty radio dial, still processing the strange exchange. &quot;I don’t know, but I think we just made contact with something beyond our understanding.&quot;

The camper continues down the road, and for the first time, you feel like there’s something else, something watching and listening.

[[Continue...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Neutral Ending" tags="" position="625,375" size="100,100">You shiver as the conversation continues to play, getting a little too close for comfort. You slam your hand down on the radio, switching it off abruptly. The silence is deafening. Bubba, who’s been half-awake this whole time, stirs and looks at you curiously.

&quot;What’s wrong?&quot; he asks, tail flicking lazily.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; you reply quickly, brushing it off. &quot;Just a weird frequency.&quot;

You drive in silence for a while, the unsettling feeling slowly fading as you focus on the road. Bubba yawns and goes back to sleep, but you can’t shake the eerie sense that the universe is somehow listening in on you.

You grab the wheel, turning it sharply as you follow the static signal. It grows louder, more urgent, and your surroundings start to blur as you race toward its source.

Eventually, you find yourself in an abandoned clearing. The radio crackles loudly as the camper comes to a stop. No buildings, no signs of life—just an empty field. The radio now screams your name in distorted waves, the conversation from last night repeating endlessly.

Before you can react, the ground beneath you begins to tremble. A dark shape looms on the horizon, and you realize too late that you’ve walked straight into a trap—a realm of endless noise, where time and space distort. The camper’s radio blares relentlessly, as you’re sucked into the chaos.

The air ripples as space and time swap places. The ground beneath you feels both distant and immediate, and the sky seems to stretch inward like a hallway.

Suddenly, you find yourself standing still in a landscape that seems frozen—except time is flowing backward. You can hear the echo of past conversations, but none of the people are in sight. In front of you, a road seems to stretch backward into the past.

The air crackles with energy, and before you can react, a man in a slightly outdated outfit appears right in front of you—John Titor, the time traveler from the future.

He blinks in confusion, looking around the cramped space. &quot;This isn’t right… I was supposed to be in 2036,&quot; he mutters, checking his watch. &quot;What dimension is this? Is this some kind of alternate timeline?&quot;

Bubba, who’s been napping in the corner, suddenly springs to his feet, snarling loudly at the intruder. His fur bristles, and he paces back and forth, clearly furious at the unexpected guest.

&quot;Who is this?!&quot; Bubba growls, his tail flicking angrily. &quot;Why is he in our camper?!&quot;

John Titor looks even more confused now, clearly not understanding what’s happening. &quot;I didn’t mean to... I just... where am I?&quot;

John Titor, still a little disoriented, watches you with cautious interest as you turn to him. &quot;How about a ride out of this dimension? You can’t stay here forever.&quot;

After some hesitation, he nods, seemingly grateful for the offer. &quot;I think that’s a good idea. I wasn’t expecting to end up in… whatever this is.&quot;

You drive the camper to a nearby portal, and after a brief but intense moment, John Titor steps through. Bubba, while still grumbling, seems satisfied that the strange visitor is gone.

[[Continue...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Neutral Ending" tags="" position="625,375" size="100,100">You ask John what he was doing right before he arrived.

His confusion is palpable, but it doesn’t do much to calm Bubba down. The dog continues to bark at him, agitated by the strange man’s sudden appearance. Eventually, you give up trying to reason with Bubba and reluctantly decide to ask John to leave. He mutters an apology before stepping out of the camper, though he looks just as confused about the whole ordeal as you do.

Bubba’s growls subside as the camper is finally calm again.

John looks bewildered, clearly not understanding why you’re so upset. But Bubba, sensing your frustration, is now even angrier. He growls loudly, backing up toward the door. You open the camper door, and with a firm shove, you push John out.

&quot;Go find your timeline elsewhere!&quot; Bubba barks, his tail wagging furiously.

As John stumbles away, you slam the door shut, grateful to have the peace restored. Bubba gives one last, satisfied snarl before settling back down for a nap.

Emerging from the fog are a group of Swiss Guards in full ceremonial armor, accompanied by a stern-faced police officer who steps forward, a gleam of suspicion in his eyes.

“By order of the Holy Council, you are to be detained,” he declares, hand on his holster. The guards surround the camper, their halberds gleaming as they raise them in a defensive ring. “We know you and the Mages Guild were responsible for… His demise,” he says, voice dripping with accusation. “Now, come quietly, or we’ll use force.”

Bubba tenses beside you, growling low in his throat. It’s clear you’ll need to act quickly if you want to avoid a holy confrontation.

Realizing too late that this was a mistake, you stop to let him out, shaken by the brief but eerie encounter.

The figure is an old woman, her wild hair streaming behind her as she grips the handlebars with a fierce determination. She lets out a shrill cackle as she gets closer, her bike rumbling with an unnatural, powerful engine.

You hear a voice. Not Bubba’s, not any magical entities you might have summoned—but a voice coming from nowhere.

&quot;Em paused for a moment, staring at the strange, shifting landscape outside the camper,&quot; the voice narrates casually, as if it’s commenting on your actions. You freeze, looking around.

&quot;Wait. What was that?&quot; you murmur, furrowing your brow.

The voice continues, undeterred. &quot;She couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something was watching her.&quot;

&quot;Are you… talking about me?&quot; You glance at Bubba, who’s busy sniffing the floor, seemingly unaffected by the oddness.

You can’t hide from me now!&quot;

You pull out a small spellbook and begin chanting a spell to locate the source of the voice. The camper shakes slightly as magic crackles in the air.

For a moment, nothing happens. Then, suddenly, a strange ripple fills the air, and the voice speaks again, slightly more nervous now. &quot;Wait, wait! No need to get aggressive! I’m just narrating your actions. I’m not really here!&quot;

You pause, realizing you’ve somehow made the narrator nervous. &quot;So you’re not even real?&quot;

&quot;Not in the traditional sense, no,&quot; the voice admits. &quot;I exist to tell your story, but I’m not a physical being.&quot;

You let out a small laugh, feeling more in control. &quot;Well, that’s strange, but fine. I guess we’ll both just get along then.&quot;

The voice doesn’t respond, but you sense a faint chuckle before it quiets again. With the mystery cleared up, you continue on your journey, a little less weirded out by the idea of being narrated.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Neutral Ending" tags="" position="625,375" size="100,100">You can’t stand it anymore. &quot;Hey! Who’s talking? Who are you?!&quot;

The voice stops, as if surprised by your outburst. There’s a long pause before it responds, &quot;I—uh, I’m the narrator. I’m the one telling your story.&quot;

You blink, bewildered. &quot;The narrator? But… you&#39;re in my head?&quot; You look around the camper, half-expecting to see someone hidden in the corner.

&quot;Well, not in your head, exactly,&quot; the voice clarifies. &quot;More like... narrating your actions. Kind of like this.&quot;

You sit in stunned silence. &quot;So… you’re like, an invisible storyteller? That’s creepy.&quot;

The voice chuckles. &quot;Yeah, I guess it is a bit weird. But don’t worry, I’m just here to tell your story.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; you grumble, &quot;I don’t like it. Can you shut up for a bit?&quot;

The voice falls silent, leaving you with a lingering sense of unease. You continue your journey, feeling a little more self-conscious than before.

But the voice keeps going. &quot;Em drove through the thickening fog, unaware of the dangers lurking ahead. Little did she know, the road would soon twist into an unexpected confrontation.&quot;

It keeps narrating, detailing your every movement, as though you aren’t even in control. You try to ignore it, but the voice grows louder, more insistent, describing even your smallest actions with alarming precision.

As you drive on, the discomfort builds. The voice continues its monologue, and you’re left feeling like you’re being controlled, unable to break free from the invisible hand that is shaping your actions.

The dimly lit interior smells of old leather and spilled drinks. The air is thick with the buzz of casual conversations and the clinking of glass. You’re both just passing through, looking to relax for a moment.

Bubba scans the room, his eyes immediately narrowing on a man sitting at the far end of the bar. He&#39;s wearing a vintage jacket and a strange, almost futuristic watch—something about him feels familiar, yet out of place.

“Em…” Bubba mutters under his breath. “Is that… John Titor?”

You squint and follow his gaze. Sure enough, the man sitting at the bar has the same unkempt look and quiet demeanor you’ve seen in old news articles. John Titor, the time traveler who allegedly made predictions about the future and the past.

Before you can say anything, Bubba stands up, fuming. His fists ball up as he glares at Titor.

“That&#39;s him. That’s the guy who ruined the timeline!” Bubba hisses, his face red with anger.

You try to follow him, but before you can catch up, Bubba stands in front of Titor, blocking his view of the bar.

“Do you have any idea what you’ve done to the timeline?” Bubba snaps, his voice full of fury. “You messed everything up! People like you don’t just get to walk around like nothing happened!”

Titor looks up, his expression unreadable. He doesn’t flinch at Bubba’s words. “I’ve done what I had to do,” he says coolly. “The timeline is always in flux.”

Bubba&#39;s face twists in rage. “Always in flux? You don’t get to play god with people’s lives!”

You try to step in, but before you can stop him, Bubba shoves Titor, knocking his drink over. The room falls silent.

Bubba throws the first punch, landing a solid hit on Titor’s jaw. Titor stumbles back but recovers quickly, pushing Bubba off with surprising strength.

A brawl breaks out in the bar. The bartender yells for you to do something, but you’re caught in the chaos. Titor seems unfazed, almost enjoying the fight as he lands a few hits on Bubba.

“Bubba, stop!” you shout. “This isn’t helping anyone!”

Bubba glares at you, his breath heavy and ragged. “He deserves it, Em! He messed up everything. You don&#39;t understand what he&#39;s done!”

Titor watches with mild interest, as if this is just another odd occurrence in his bizarre life. “You’re wasting your time. The timeline has already been changed. There’s no going back.”

Patrons flee, and you’re left standing in the middle of it all, trying to figure out how to stop this madness.

Eventually, the authorities arrive, and the situation devolves into a mess of paperwork and accusations. The only thing you’re sure of is that this encounter won’t be forgotten anytime soon.

Titor smirks. “I know.”

You take Bubba by the arm and start to leave the bar, finally making your way out of the heated situation. The bar falls back into its usual rhythm, and you and Bubba are left with a lingering sense of frustration.

“Well, that was… something,” Bubba grumbles. “I still think he’s got a lot to answer for.”

You can only shake your head. “Maybe, but we don’t need to solve it with our fists.”

Bubba is snoring gently on a battered cot, while you shuffle through a thick folder of top-secret documents stamped with a bold red label: Project Moonfall. The Britannia government has given you a task, one that only someone with your magical skills and expertise in illusion could pull off.

“Fake the moon landing,” the letter read, curt and to the point.

You glance at Bubba, then back at the documents. Is this something you really want to do? The government offers ample gold, but you’re uneasy. You have a choice to make.

[[Accept the mission]] [[Refuse the mission and confront the officials]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Accept the mission" tags="" position="475,525" size="100,100">You shake Bubba awake, showing him the files. “They want us to fake the moon landing,” you say. Bubba raises an eyebrow, rubbing his eyes. “And they think we’re the best for the job?”

You nod. “Apparently, they’ve tried it without magic before and failed miserably. Now they’re counting on a few illusions and some clever conjuring to make the whole world believe Britannia is the first on the moon.”

Together, you pour over the schematics for a fake lunar module, stage design plans, and, most intriguingly, an enchanted camera to add a convincing sense of cosmic depth to your “lunar landscape.”

[[Begin work on building the lunar module]] [[Research and enchant the camera]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Refuse the mission and confront the officials" tags="" position="587.5,525" size="100,100">Deciding to reject the mission, you head down the shadowy corridors of the bunker until you find Commander Ashford’s office, a stern woman known for her cold demeanor and steely gaze. You toss the mission papers on her desk.

“I’m not doing it,” you say, crossing your arms. “Faking a moon landing? Find someone else.”

She arches an eyebrow and reaches into her drawer, pulling out a photo. “Recognize this?” she asks. You lean closer and see an image of the Scraps of Creation—a fragmented realm you’ve spent years studying.

“If you succeed in this mission,” Ashford says with a smirk, “we’ll give you access to the Scraps.”

Reluctantly, you nod. The promise of accessing a source of such raw magic is hard to resist.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Begin work on building the lunar module" tags="" position="412.5,650" size="100,100">The “lunar module” is a slapdash creation of wood, metal scraps, and enchantments. Bubba shakes his head, mumbling about how it’s “more like a lunar wagon.” Together, you set up in a giant soundstage filled with gray sand, large rocks, and a painted black backdrop dotted with shimmering stars.

You instruct Bubba to put on the bulky spacesuit designed for the occasion. As he clambers into the suit and wobbles into position, you can’t help but smile at the absurdity.
First Take

“Action!” you call out, and Bubba hops from the “module,” kicking up powdered dust. But as he lands, he loses his balance and falls, knocking over a rock prop.

Bubba laughs as he drops gray powder on the set to mimic lunar dust, and you conjure a soft haze over the scene to mimic the eerie silence of space.
Bubba’s Suggestions

“If we’re gonna do this, why not add some alien plants?” Bubba grins, gesturing toward a set of strange, spiky plants growing in the corner.

[[Add alien flora for a cosmic touch]] [[Stick with a classic barren moon landscape]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Add alien flora for a cosmic touch" tags="" position="600,900" size="100,100">You summon a set of softly glowing, spiky plants with petals that slowly change color. Bubba looks impressed. “Well, that’ll get the conspiracy theorists talking,” he says with a chuckle. The camera hums, capturing the scene as you whisper an incantation to make the petals shimmer as if in a weightless atmosphere.

Bubba hops gracefully from the module and plants a fake Britannian flag into the sand. As he does so, you whisper a quiet spell to create a low hum, giving the illusion of distant, cosmic winds. The camera captures everything, a perfect simulation of a lunar experience.
Just Before Wrapping Up

Suddenly, the entire stage shakes, and lights flicker. Bubba yelps, dropping the flag. You both freeze as a shadow looms over the set—it’s Commander Ashford, clearly unimpressed.

“Faster, Witch,” she says. “We have an entire planet to convince.”

[[Speed up the filming]] [[Attempt to create a more convincing, magical illusion to impress Ashford]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Speed up the filming" tags="" position="537.5,1150" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Attempt to create a more convincing, magical illusion to impress Ashford" tags="" position="662.5,1150" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Passaggio senza titolo" tags="" position="900,1050" size="100,100">After a few grueling nights, the film is complete.

Commander Ashford storms in, demanding you “take responsibility for this mess.” With a sigh, you and Bubba decide it’s time to disappear.

Tables are stacked with random knick-knacks, antique furniture, and boxes of who-knows-what. Bubba is rummaging through a pile of gadgets when his eyes light up, and he holds up a curious-looking device—a scouter, almost identical to the ones worn by the famed Prince Aegetv in Nragond Lallb.

“Look, Em! Can you believe it? This could be the real deal!” he exclaims, adjusting the scouter over his eye.

You smirk. “Think it still works?”

Bubba squints through the lens, pressing a button on the side. The device whirs to life, casting a faint glow across his face. Numbers begin flickering on the screen, and you realize it’s actually scanning his surroundings.

“Whoa,” Bubba mutters. “I think it’s measuring my power level!” He looks at you, eyes wide with excitement. “Em, let’s try it on you!”

[[Scavenge, 35, You try to remember if you’ve ever seen a device like this before, but nothing comes to mind. -&gt; Hand Bubba a few coins to buy it and try it out]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name=" Hand Bubba a few coins to buy it and try it out" tags="" position="700,425" size="100,100">Back in the camper, Bubba slips on the scouter and points it toward you. The device hums and, after a second, flashes a series of numbers.

“Not bad!” Bubba says, grinning as he reads your “power level.” But curiosity soon gets the best of him, and he glances outside, where a few townsfolk are wandering by. “I wonder if it works on other people?”

“Only one way to find out,” you reply, smirking.

He steps out of the camper and points the scouter at a random passerby: an elderly man hobbling along with a cane.

[[Observation, 20, The device makes an odd crackling sound, and you see faint numbers blinking erratically on the screen. -&gt; Bubba squints at the readout as it finally settles on a surprisingly high number]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name=" Bubba squints at the readout as it finally settles on a surprisingly high number" tags="" position="700,550" size="100,100">The scouter flashes a surprisingly high number as it analyzes the elderly man. Bubba’s jaw drops. “No way. This guy’s reading off the charts!”

You watch as the old man turns, eyes glinting. “Back in my day, we didn’t have fancy contraptions like that. We relied on instinct,” he says with a mysterious smile.

Bubba blinks. “Em, do you think he’s… actually powerful?”

“Or maybe the scouter’s busted,” you mutter. But a part of you feels there’s more to this man than meets the eye.

[[Intuition, 40, The man gives you a knowing look, and you feel a strange aura about him.

The bakery clerk raises an eyebrow as Bubba points the scouter at the donut. The device hums, calculating as if assessing the potential power of the pastry. The reading that comes up is absurdly low, barely even registering.

“Looks like it’s just a regular donut, Bubba,” you laugh. “Nothing magical about this one.”

Bubba sighs. “Well, not every reading can be off the charts.”

The baker, overhearing you, grins. “I may not sell magic donuts, but I guarantee they taste divine.”

You hand Bubba a few coins, and he purchases the donut anyway, deciding that even if it has no power level, it still has value as a snack.

[[Observation, 15, The donut seems to have a faint, sugary aura… or maybe that’s just the glaze. Either way, it’s delicious. -&gt; Enjoy the donut and laugh about the scouter&#39;s quirks as you leave the bakery]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name=" Enjoy the donut and laugh about the scouter&#39;s quirks as you leave the bakery" tags="" position="825,750" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Back on the road" tags="" position="700,725" size="100,100">With the scouter now settled on the dashboard, Bubba leans back in his seat, still marveling over the quirky readings and mysterious encounters of the day.

The camper rolls forward, leaving the small town behind. You take one last glance back, wondering what other secrets lie hidden in its quiet streets.

The road stretches out before you, winding toward the unknown.

Bubba grins mischievously and points the scouter at the kid, watching as the numbers flicker and settle on a moderately high reading.

The child notices Bubba staring and runs over, looking excited. “What’s that thing? Can I try it?”

Bubba looks at you, clearly torn between letting the kid try the scouter and keeping it for his own fun.

“Sure, why not?” you say with a shrug.

Bubba hands the scouter over, and the kid giggles with delight, placing it on their head and pressing the button to test it out. They aim it straight at you, eyes wide in amazement as the numbers flicker to life.

“Whoa! You’re strong!” the child exclaims, impressed.

You chuckle. “Guess I’ve got some hidden powers, huh?”

[[Intuition, 30, The scouter flickers erratically, almost as if it&#39;s misreading you.

Its tail wags happily as it trots up to you, seemingly unfazed by strangers. Without missing a beat, Bubba slips on the scouter and points it at the dog.

The scouter whirs, and after a few seconds, flashes a surprisingly low number.

“Huh,” Bubba mutters, looking slightly disappointed. “Not exactly a fierce beast.”

The dog looks up at you, head tilted as if offended by Bubba&#39;s reaction, then lets out a tiny bark, its tail wagging faster.

“Well, you might not have a high power level,” you say, petting the dog’s head, “but you’ve got plenty of personality.”

At one point, he points it at a streetlamp and gets a result that shouldn’t even be possible. The lamp flickers as if reacting to his scrutiny.

“Maybe this thing’s overloaded,” he mutters. “Or maybe it’s not meant for dimensions like ours.”

You give him a sympathetic pat on the shoulder. “Could be. But we’ve seen some weird things. Maybe everything in this town has some hidden energy we can’t see.”

Just then, the device sparks, and the screen goes black.

“Well, that’s disappointing,” Bubba sighs, slipping it off his head.

[[Electronics, 45, You inspect the scouter, hoping to revive it, but the technology seems beyond repair.

He looks at the broken scouter in Bubba’s hands, then glances up with a sly smile.

“Not all things are meant to be measured,” he says. “Some powers are beyond numbers and devices.”

With that, he taps his cane twice on the ground, and you feel a strange energy ripple through the air. Before you can react, he turns and walks away, disappearing into the misty streets.

You and Bubba exchange a glance.

“Do you think…?” Bubba starts, but you just shake your head, smiling.

“Let’s just say, sometimes it’s better to leave some mysteries unsolved.”

As you wander, you notice something peculiar—no haggling, no bartering. Every item has a fixed price, each transaction smoothly processed by blank-eyed clerks wearing silver badges. Bubba whispers, “This place is under the Collective’s thumb. Best watch yourself.”

Just as he finishes, a sharply dressed figure approaches, silver pin gleaming on their lapel. They smile with calculated charm.

“Em, isn’t it?” they say, extending a gloved hand. “The Hypercapitalist Collective has been watching your... travels. We’d like to discuss a business opportunity.”

[[Listen to their proposal]] [[Turn them down immediately and leave]] [[Ask them for more details on the “opportunity”]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Listen to their proposal" tags="" position="625,450" size="100,100">The Collective agent leads you to a sleek, mirrored office building that stands oddly out of place among Grafton’s grungy stalls. As you settle into an uncomfortable metal chair, they lay out their offer with a practiced smile.

“Our data analytics show that you have the rare skill set we need,” they begin. “We’re seeking assistance in a matter of... let’s call it ‘resource acquisition.’ Specifically, we need help bypassing certain magical protections around an artifact called the Heart of Resilience. You’ll be well-compensated, of course.”

They slide a contract across the table, filled with tiny print.

[[sign, 30, You try to read the contract but find the legal language overwhelming; it’s clear they’re hiding something. -&gt;Sign the contract anyway]] [[sign, 30, You struggle to read the contract and decide not to risk it without more clarity. -&gt;Demand transparency]] [[Request to read the contract in full]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Turn them down immediately and leave" tags="" position="800,500" size="100,100">Without a word, you turn and walk away, with Bubba close behind. But as you’re exiting the marketplace, a sudden hush falls over the crowd. Silver-badged clerks turn to stare at you, their expressions cold and unreadable. One clerk steps forward, blocking your path.

“Leaving without hearing our full offer, are you?” they say, voice dripping with disappointment. “That’s... unfortunate.”

[[Stealth, 35, You attempt to slip past the guards undetected, but they spot you immediately and close in. -&gt; Attempt to reason with the clerk]] [[Stealth, 35, You manage to evade the guards, slipping into the back alleys of Grafton and disappearing from sight. -&gt; Hide and plan your next move]] [[Attempt to reason with the clerk directly]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Ask them for more details on the “opportunity”" tags="" position="925,500" size="100,100">The agent chuckles, an amused glint in their eye. “Cautious. I like that. The Heart of Resilience is a unique magical object, capable of shielding its owner from any form of magical interference. With it in our possession, we could guarantee safe passage for our high-value shipments through even the most dangerous territories.”

They lean in closer. “We’ll pay handsomely, and if you refuse, well... let’s just say life in Grafton can be challenging for those who refuse to cooperate.”

“Welcome to the Collective. We’ll provide you with an escort to the Heart’s current location. Our legal team will, of course, ensure you’re well-protected on this journey.”

You feel a cold tingle as magic binds you to the terms. There’s no turning back now.

Bubba gives you a wary look but climbs in beside you. “Just remember, Em,” he whispers, “these people don’t give anything without a cost.”

The drive is silent until you reach a tall, fortified warehouse. The agent gestures to a sealed metal door. “The Heart of Resilience is inside. We’ve disabled some defenses, but there are... residual hazards.”

[[convoking, 45, You summon a protective shield, feeling it pulse as you approach the door. -&gt; Enter the warehouse cautiously]] [[convoking, 45, You fail to summon a shield, and the residual magic around the door crackles ominously. -&gt; Prepare for potential dangers inside]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Reject the offer with conviction" tags="" position="1050,625" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Pretend to agree while secretly planning to sabotage the operation" tags="" position="1175,625" size="100,100">You give a calculated smile. “Consider me interested,” you say, knowing that any chance to foil the Collective’s plans will be worth it.

As the agent arranges transportation, you discreetly signal to Bubba. He catches on, nodding slightly. You’ll need to be on your guard—and ready to turn the tables at the right moment.

You nod, knowing he’s right. But there’s an unspoken tension; the promise of the Collective’s payment is enticing, yet the mission is undoubtedly risky.

The next, the world around you warps and fractures, twisting into a maze of shifting walls and strange colors. Bubba vanishes, leaving you alone in an echoing void. You feel a shiver as a voice fills the space, mocking and sharp.

“Welcome, Em,” it purrs. “I’ve been waiting for a player like you.”

A figure materializes—draped in dark robes, eyes glinting with cruel amusement. You recognize the emblem on his chest: the symbol of Eris, the goddess of discord. This must be one of her servants, here to toy with you.

“We’re going to play a game,” he says, his grin widening. “The stakes? Oh, just a little thing called your soul.”

Candles flicker on the walls, casting unsettling shapes as you find yourself standing on a checkered floor. A throne sits at the far end, and the servant gestures for you to take a place on the game board.

“Simple rules,” he says. “I’ll pose riddles, set challenges, and in each round, you may choose to move closer to victory—or to defeat. Fail a round, and you’ll lose something… important.”

The figures around you watch in eerie silence, their faces obscured. Each one seems to radiate malice, feeding off the tension in the air.

[[Cryptography, 25, The patterns on the floor seem to spell something out. -&gt; Examine the checkered tiles closely for clues]]

He grins, his eyes glinting with dark excitement.

“Inside this box,” he intones, “is a secret. Solve the riddle, and you may move forward. Fail, and I’ll claim a part of you as my prize.”

He speaks the riddle with a sneer: “I can be cracked, made, told, and played. What am I?”

[[Intuition, 25, You think carefully, turning the words over in your mind. -&gt; Try to solve the riddle]]

The servant’s smile falters, and the shadowy figures around you let out a collective murmur. He narrows his eyes but snaps his fingers, allowing you to step forward.

“Well done, Em. But don’t get comfortable. The game has only just begun.”

A doorway appears ahead, shrouded in mist.

[[Spiritism, 30, You feel an eerie pull from beyond the doorway. -&gt; Enter the misty doorway with caution]]

But instead of your own reflection, it shows Bubba, trapped and struggling in a cage. You gasp as he looks up, meeting your gaze with pleading eyes.

“Help… Em, please…”

The servant’s voice echoes in the air. “This game will test your mind and your heart. Choose: you may free Bubba now and lose your place in the game, or you may leave him and continue to fight for your soul.”

You clench your fists. Is this real, or just a cruel illusion?

[[Empathy, 40, You reach out, trying to sense if this is truly Bubba or a trick. -&gt; Attempt to confirm if Bubba is real]]

[[Convoking, 35, You summon a small spirit to verify the truth behind the mirror. -&gt; Call a spirit for guidance]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name=" Step into the next room confidently" tags="" position="625,1025" size="100,100">Your mind races, but no answer feels right. The servant chuckles as you stammer, his fingers snapping with relish.

“Oh, poor Em,” he mocks, as a sharp pain slices through you. A strange, numbing sensation creeps over your limbs, and you feel a piece of yourself—perhaps a memory or part of your magic—being stripped away.

“Better luck in the next round,” he says, his tone dripping with satisfaction.

[[Recover your bearings, realizing the stakes are higher than you thought -&gt;Continue to the next round with renewed caution]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Continue to the next round with renewed caution" tags="" position="625,1150" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name=" Attempt to confirm if Bubba is real" tags="" position="300,1150" size="100,100">Focusing deeply, you reach out with your heart, seeking any hint of Bubba’s true presence. A faint warmth reassures you—it’s him. But the mirror is enchanted, and freeing him would mean stepping backward in the game.

You make the difficult decision to prioritize Bubba, reaching out and breaking the mirror’s barrier. Bubba stumbles free, breathing heavily.

“Thank you, Em,” he says, and though you’ve lost ground, his grateful smile is worth it.

Strange beasts lurk in the darkness, their eyes gleaming, their growls echoing through the hall.

“To win, Em, you must reach the center. But beware—these beasts hunger for more than flesh.”

The path splits into three directions, each one filled with flickering shadows and growling creatures.

[[Swordsgirlship, 45, You summon a blade, ready to fight through the beasts. -&gt; Take the right path with weapon in hand]]

They snap and claw, but you’re faster, stronger, pushing through until you reach the maze’s heart. The servant stands waiting, his smirk replaced by a frown.

“Impossible,” he mutters, defeated as the maze crumbles.

You feel yourself lifted from his twisted world, the oppressive presence fading as you return to reality. You’re back in the camper, Bubba at your side.

“Welcome back, Em,” he says with relief. You smile, grateful to be free of the game.

The world begins to dissolve around you. You’re back in the camper, Bubba beside you, as the servant’s angry cries fade into nothingness.

“Glad to have you back,” Bubba says, giving you a supportive pat on the shoulder.

As the labyrinth collapses, you return to your reality. Bubba’s beside you, and the servant’s world is gone.

Bubba grins, “That was one heck of a trip, huh?”

You laugh, relieved. “Let’s not do it again.”

After passing through a cluster of swirling purple clouds, the ground beneath you starts to feel… odd. The tires of the camper seem to lose their grip, and the world outside the window begins to tilt.

You glance over at Bubba, who looks just as confused.

“Uh, Em… is it just me, or is the sky… on the bottom?” he asks, squinting out the window.

You blink and look down. Sure enough, the sky is upside down, and the ground is now above you, as though gravity itself has flipped.

The camper slowly floats upwards, following the shift in gravity. Your heart races as the reality of the situation settles in—you&#39;re stuck in a gravity-reversed zone.

What will you do now?

[[Observation, 50, You carefully observe the surroundings, hoping to find something useful to explain the gravity shift. Fail: Bubba panics and starts pulling at the windows, causing a small tear in the camper&#39;s side. -&gt; Tell Bubba to calm down and look for a way out]]

“It’s not going to help, Bubba! We need to find something heavier!” you shout.

But Bubba, now overly confident, attempts to &quot;anchor&quot; the camper to the ground by throwing the suitcase out of the window.

[[Strength, 40, You try to grab Bubba before he does anything rash. Fail: Bubba tosses the suitcase out, and it only accelerates your floating. -&gt; Grab a few heavy objects to counterbalance the camper]]

“Em, do you think we can float down to the ground and find a way out?” Bubba asks, still holding tightly to the seat.

The camper needs to be lowered slowly, but you’ll need to gather the right materials and prepare for a careful descent.

&quot;Alright, Bubba, I think we can use the camper&#39;s emergency systems to lower ourselves,&quot; you say, steadying your nerves. &quot;But we need to prepare everything first. Start securing all the objects, and get the manual ready.&quot;

You and Bubba take a deep breath and look around, realizing that the area is oddly silent, as if the strange force that reversed gravity is now gone.

“Well, that was something,” Bubba says, shaking his head.

It’s one of your favorite spots in all the worlds, though you haven’t had a chance to visit in years. Bubba yawns beside you, scratching his head. &quot;You sure you want to go in there? Smells like dust and old paper.&quot;

You grin, feeling the thrill of adventure tingling at your fingertips. “Bubba, every dusty tome in there is a doorway. A doorway to a story, a spell, a place long forgotten.” He sighs but follows as you enter.

The moment you step inside, a strange, cool breeze sweeps past you, rustling the pages of a thousand books. The air smells of old leather, ink, and secrets.

Finally, you reach the Mythology section. Books here seem to radiate a strange glow, and you’re drawn to one in particular—a dusty tome titled The Whispered Realms.

As you open it, the pages emit a faint hum. The words seem to swirl, and suddenly, you realize the book might actually be enchanted.

[[arcanism, 40, You attempt to control the magic in the book, but the words rearrange into strange symbols, leaving you dizzy. -&gt;Try again]] [[arcanism, 40, You steady yourself and concentrate, the book’s energy settling into a readable text. -&gt;Begin reading]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Wander aimlessly down the forgotten aisles" tags="" position="525,525" size="100,100">You let your instincts guide you as you wander through the aisles.

Bubba looks around, uneasy. &quot;Are we lost?&quot;

You smile, feeling the thrill of it. “In the best way possible.” A flash of movement catches your eye. You think you saw something—or someone—slipping between the stacks.

A faint voice calls out, whispering, “Seek the key, or risk being lost within.”

One book catches your eye—it’s massive, with a lock on the cover. An inscription reads: Only those who seek with pure intent may unlock the truth.

You shrug, closing the book gently. The voice fades, but you sense it’s given you something—a mental map, like a path through the library.

Bubba watches uneasily, but you nod, intrigued. “How can I help?”

The spirit gestures toward a hidden alcove. “Within lies a tome—if you can find it, you may be able to release me.”

“Thank you,” she whispers, as her form fades into light and disappears.

You’re left alone in the quiet alcove, with only the hum of the library around you.

You glance over at him, surprised to see him grimacing in discomfort.

“What’s going on, Bubba?” you ask, noticing his face turning red as he struggles to breathe.

“I don’t know!” Bubba gasps, clutching his throat. “I feel like... like something’s stuck...”

Before you can even react, he opens his mouth, and a stream of coins bursts out, clinking loudly as they hit the floor and roll around. The sound of metal hitting metal fills the camper, and Bubba’s face goes pale with shock.

“What the hell?” you shout, scrambling back as the coins keep coming, pouring out of his mouth faster than you could ever imagine. It’s like an endless river of coins—quarters, nickels, dimes, and even gold coins—spilling out with no end in sight. Bubba’s chest heaves as he struggles to breathe between the bursts of coins.

It’s clear this is becoming a serious issue, and you need to act before Bubba passes out.

“You need to breathe, Bubba!” you say, trying to remain calm, but your hands are shaking. “Focus on your breath! In through the nose, out through the mouth. I’ve got you.”

He nods weakly but doesn’t seem to be able to control the flood of coins. His eyes widen, and he starts to shake, which only makes things worse.

[[Meditation, 60, You try to get Bubba to focus on a breathing technique to help slow down the panic. Fail: The stress only makes the coins come faster, and Bubba nearly collapses from exhaustion. -&gt; Call out to nearby people for help]]

His breathing is labored, and you notice his eyes darting around in panic. There’s something strangely familiar about this situation… Maybe you’ve heard of something like this before?

“Bubba!” you shout, snapping him out of his daze. “Did you eat anything weird today? Anything that might’ve caused this?”

Bubba gulps, still gasping for air. “I had… a weird sandwich from that place we passed earlier. I thought it was just a joke!”

You roll your eyes, realizing what might have happened. The sandwich must have been enchanted somehow. A quick check of your surroundings shows no obvious source for the spell, but it might still be lingering. You have to act fast.

You look around the camper for any other clues. Maybe it’s a curse, or something triggered by an external force.

You spot an odd symbol etched into the floor of the camper, hidden beneath the pile of coins. It’s faint, but it looks like it’s pulsating.

“Bubba,” you say, looking closely at the symbol. “This wasn’t just a random thing. Someone or something is behind this. I think we’ve been cursed.”

Bubba manages to wheeze out, “Cursed… by who?”

You scan the area. “It could be Eris, or maybe some other mischievous being. It might be a spell designed to cause chaos… We need to stop the flow somehow.”

Bubba takes a deep breath, gasping for air as the last coin falls from his mouth.

“Thanks, Em,” he says, exhausted but relieved. “I thought I was gonna die of asphyxiation from money…”

You shake your head, looking at the piles of coins that now cover the camper’s floor. “Let’s never talk about this again, okay?”</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Passaggio senza titolo 3" tags="" position="725,1175" size="100,100">Despite your best efforts, the curse seems to be getting worse. Bubba can barely breathe anymore, and you’re out of ideas. The camper fills with coins, and the situation grows dire.

“Help!” Bubba gasps, clutching his throat. “I can’t take it anymore…”

In a last-ditch effort, you try to escape the camper, hoping that getting out of the cursed space might stop the flow. But it’s too late. The camper is a massive pile of coins, and you’re trapped.

You sigh. “Well, Bubba, looks like we’re in for a long night…”</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>

The store’s aisles curve in impossible ways, twisting around corners that can’t possibly exist. The air smells of old paper, spices, and something faintly metallic.
Bubba looks around, clearly intrigued, but also a little unnerved. &#39;I’ve seen some weird places, Em, but this… this takes the cake.&#39;
You nod, scanning the shelves. There are strange trinkets and peculiar items everywhere: old lanterns that seem to flicker with no flame, jars filled with shimmering dust, and books with spines that seem to change when you’re not looking.
&#39;Let’s set up camp,&#39; you say, deciding it might be best to rest for a bit and figure out what’s going on. You pull out your tent, and Bubba starts gathering firewood, though there’s no telling where it’s coming from.

Bubba grins as he gathers some firewood that appears to come out of nowhere. The store’s eerie silence makes you feel like you’re being watched, though there’s no one around.
&#39;This is definitely a place that’s not supposed to exist,&#39; Bubba mutters, glancing nervously at the aisles.
[[Ignore the feeling of being watched and just enjoy camping with Bubba]]

The aisles curve in a different direction now, as though the space itself is rearranging. Bubba narrows his eyes. &#39;What’s going on here?&#39; he mutters, but you don’t have an answer.
The shelves stretch on endlessly in every direction, and you can’t see a clear path to the exit anymore.
[[observation, 15, You notice strange symbols etched into the shelves -&gt;Investigate the symbols]]

The aisles continue endlessly in all directions, and the walls now seem to be made of a shifting, liquid-like material that reflects odd colors. The air is thick and oppressive, and the atmosphere feels increasingly unnatural.

&quot;Uh, Em, I’m getting a bad feeling about this,&quot; Bubba says, stepping closer to you, his voice tight with unease. &quot;We’ve gotta get out of here.&quot;

You turn to look around, but everything looks the same—strange and alien, and now even more distorted. The walls pulse as if alive. Every movement you make echoes unnervingly through the space.

You close your eyes, trying to recall what you know about places like this—ancient stores that aren’t supposed to exist, appearing in forgotten corners of the world, sometimes in dreams, sometimes in legends.

Your mind wanders back to old stories you’ve heard over the years—tales of wandering merchants who spoke of selling goods in places that shifted between dimensions. Of stores that existed in both the past and the future, in places that had no real physical location but rather were built upon an ever-changing landscape of time itself. You remember one story in particular: a store built atop the ruins of an ancient temple, its shelves filled with items that seemed to rewrite reality with every touch. In this store, things you bought would change with you; they would grow or decay depending on your own state of mind. But the most chilling part of the story was always the same—no one ever left the store in the same way they entered.

The weight of the legend feels like a veil settling over your thoughts. The more you think, the more it becomes clear that this place is part of a much older network—a system of stores scattered across forgotten dimensions, some of which might have been abandoned, and others that still pulse with energy.

As you gather your thoughts, Bubba looks at you quizzically. “You okay, Em?”

You nod, but you don’t feel entirely sure. This place feels too familiar now. The ancient stories weren&#39;t just stories after all. They were warnings.

Suddenly, the store’s walls shift and warp around you, as if responding to your thoughts. It’s unsettling, but you can’t help but feel that you&#39;re on the brink of understanding something vast and incomprehensible.

Perhaps there’s a way to find an exit. Or perhaps there’s something else you&#39;re meant to uncover here.

[[Explore deeper to see if the walls reveal more clues.-&gt;Shelves]]

There’s no sign of life—no people, no creatures, no movement except for the shifting aisles. The idea of being completely alone in this strange, unchanging place makes your skin crawl.

Bubba watches you, his brow furrowed with concern. “You think someone’s here? Or are we just stuck with the walls for company?”

“Well, there might be someone,” you reply, thinking that maybe there’s some hidden figure, some entity that knows the way out—or at least has answers about this place. If anything, you need some sort of contact to ground yourself.

You clear your throat and call out, “Hello? Is anyone here?”

Your voice echoes, the sound unnervingly loud in the silent space. For a moment, nothing happens. Then, faintly, you hear something—a low, almost imperceptible murmur that seems to come from deep within the aisles.

Bubba’s eyes widen. “You heard that too, right?”

You nod. The murmur turns into a soft, rhythmic sound, like a chant or a melody, distant and muffled but unmistakable. It seems to be coming from deeper within the store. Something—or someone—is responding.

With a cautious glance at Bubba, you decide to investigate the source of the sound. You follow the trail, your heart pounding in your chest as you step deeper into the store’s endless aisles. As you move, the walls seem to ripple with the sound, like they’re alive, echoing back your every step.

The chanting grows louder, and soon, you find yourself at the edge of a strange, glowing circle etched into the floor, surrounded by ancient symbols. In the center of the circle stands a figure—a cloaked individual, too indistinct to make out fully, who seems to be the source of the strange hum that has filled the air.

The figure doesn’t speak but raises one hand, gesturing for you to come closer. Something about the figure feels strangely familiar, as though you’ve encountered them before—or maybe you will in some future time.

Your curiosity piqued, you step forward, prepared for whatever answers they may hold.

&#39;What are these?&#39; you wonder aloud, but Bubba shrugs, clearly unsettled.

You turn around and walk back toward the tent, but as you do, the aisles around you begin to twist. The shelves shift, making it harder to find your way back.
The eerie silence returns, and you start to feel as though the store is mocking you, shifting just out of reach every time you think you’re near the tent.
&#39;Maybe this was a mistake,&#39; Bubba mutters, having somehow reappeared behind you. &#39;We’re trapped, Em.&#39;
The aisles stretch into infinity, and you realize that the way out might not exist at all.

The images flicker quickly, never staying long enough for you to fully understand them.
Bubba taps you on the shoulder. &#39;We need to figure this out, Em. Maybe these walls are showing us where we are.&#39;

It takes a few moments of intense concentration, but you finally start to make out the flow of the magic. These symbols are part of an ancient spell, a ward of protection, but it’s corrupted. Instead of shielding, it seems to be trying to draw power from the environment around it.

With your newfound understanding, you carefully begin the process of unweaving the magic. The symbols lose their glow, the vibration in the air ceases, and the shelf’s strange aura fades.

“Done,” you say, wiping a bead of sweat from your brow. “It was feeding on ambient magic.”
Bubba looks relieved, but you can’t shake the feeling that something darker still lurks in the corners of this place.
[[Check the shelf]]

These aren’t just magical runes—they appear to be part of a complex code. Your mind begins to churn through the possibilities, trying to decipher their meaning. You recognize some of the shapes as old language patterns, likely of a lost civilization.

After a few moments, you manage to piece the symbols together. It seems to be a cryptic message:
&quot;Only the blood of the forgotten will open the gate.&quot;

As the realization hits, the symbols on the shelf glow brighter for a moment. Suddenly, you hear a creaking sound from the back of the room, followed by the distinct shifting of stone. The shelf slides forward, revealing a hidden compartment in the wall. Inside lies a small chest.

Bubba steps forward, cautiously. &quot;Is this... what it meant?&quot; he asks, his voice tinged with awe.

The patterns seem familiar; these are wards, but they aren’t the usual protective runes you would expect. Instead, these seem like warnings, perhaps to ward off an intrusion or prevent something from escaping.

As you trace the symbols, a ripple of cold air sweeps through the room. The markings seem to be reacting to your touch, like they’re aware of your presence. With a shiver down your spine, you pull your hand away, but not before you notice something strange: the symbols have changed. They&#39;ve begun to glow a dark crimson hue, pulsating with an ominous rhythm.

&quot;What did you do?&quot; Bubba asks, backing away. &quot;I think we’ve just triggered something.”

Suddenly, the ground trembles. A low rumble echoes from deeper within the facility. You feel an overwhelming sensation of danger—a dark force has been awakened.

When you open your eyes, you find yourself standing in a completely different place—still inside the store, but it looks different. The shelves are more chaotic, and the aisles twist at strange angles. Bubba is gone.
&#39;What happened?&#39; you whisper to yourself.
Suddenly, the light flickers, revealing a hidden door in the distance. You can’t help but feel that it’s your way out.
[[Open the door]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Call out to the light" tags="" position="1150,775" size="100,100">You call out to the light, your voice echoing through the aisles.

Suddenly, the light shifts, forming a figure—an ancient being that seems to be made of pure light. It steps forward, speaking in a language you don’t understand, but you feel the words in your chest as though they’re being spoken directly to your heart.

&quot;You seek answers, but they are not for you.&quot;
The walls start to hum louder, and you feel yourself being drawn into them, as if the space is swallowing you whole. For a moment, the world around you fades to black.
When your vision returns, you’re standing in the center of the store once more, but everything has changed. The aisles are now completely still. Bubba stands by the tent, looking worried, but no longer seems to recognize you.
The walls have reset everything. It’s as if you’ve been trapped in an endless loop.

After what feels like hours, you come to a sudden stop. A doorway appears before you—seemingly out of nowhere, bathed in a faint light. You walk toward it cautiously, heart pounding, hoping this is the exit you’ve been searching for.
As you step through the door, the world shifts. You’re no longer in the store, but standing in an open field under a strange sky. Bubba is beside you, looking equally confused.
&#39;Well, I guess that worked,&#39; he says, still looking around.
But something feels off. You have no idea where you are, and the air feels too still. It might be an escape… but it’s still a mystery.

You realize that the patterns aren’t random; they seem to be forming a map—a map of an entirely different reality, one where time and space bend in unpredictable ways.

But as you try to trace the stars, they shift and twist, mocking your efforts. The sense of disorientation is overwhelming, and for a moment, you lose your sense of direction entirely. The map you’ve begun to chart flickers out of existence, leaving you feeling helpless.

Bubba grabs your arm, pulling you away from the shifting walls. &quot;This is bad, Em. We need a new plan.&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="See if you can find a way to stabilize the surroundings" tags="" position="1400,325" size="100,100">You kneel down to inspect the walls more closely. The liquid material shifts beneath your fingertips, a strange substance that seems part organic, part mineral. It feels slick, almost like molten glass, yet it doesn’t burn you. It reflects odd colors—pinks, blues, and purples—in ways that seem impossible for regular materials.

You realize this isn’t just a wall—this is a manifestation of unstable, shifting geological forces. A form of rock, liquefied and manipulated by powerful forces beyond your understanding. If you can stabilize it, the walls might stop shifting, and perhaps you can re-establish some semblance of order.

Drawing on your geological knowledge, you attempt to apply pressure at key points, trying to lock the material into a more stable form. As you press your palms against the liquid wall, you feel a strange resistance. For a moment, it seems like the material might respond to you—then it pushes back violently, causing the walls to ripple.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Attempt to hack into the liquid material" tags="" position="1525,325" size="100,100">You activate the cybernetic implant in your arm, linking it to your internal network. The walls seem to pulse in rhythm with your movements as you try to interface with them. You focus your neural patterns, pushing the data streams from your implants into the liquid substance that surrounds you.

A sharp buzz in your skull signals a connection, but it’s not what you expected. The wall responds, not with access to any hidden systems, but with an invasive, overwhelming surge of information—images, sounds, voices—all jumbled and distorted. It’s as if you’ve accessed the thoughts of the walls themselves.

The flood of data overwhelms you. Your vision blurs as flashes of impossible images streak past your consciousness—holographic visions of faraway places, strange symbols, cryptic messages. A low hum fills the air, vibrating through your entire body. Just as you&#39;re about to disconnect, the ground beneath your feet shifts violently.

Your vision snaps back into focus, but it’s not the room you were just in. You find yourself in an entirely different environment—a small, sterile room with rows upon rows of humming servers and data terminals. The walls here are clean, smooth, and white, and you can hear the faint sound of machinery working in the background.

Bubba isn’t with you. In fact, you’re alone. The environment is stark, with no windows, no doors—just rows of equipment. Your head is spinning from the unexpected transition, and the last thing you remember was the pulsating liquid walls of the strange, shifting aisles.

[[Inspect the equipment]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Search for a hidden exit" tags="" position="1750,275" size="100,100">You pull out your dowsing rods and begin to scan the area, hoping to detect any hidden paths or exits. As you walk carefully through the shifting aisles, the rods vibrate in your hands, indicating something faintly ahead.

You follow the sensation, the rods guiding you as you approach what seems like an alcove in the walls—an opening that wasn’t there moments ago. The walls, still shifting, reveal a narrow gap, just wide enough for you to slip through.

Bubba gives you a skeptical look. &quot;You sure about this?&quot; he asks.

The rods pulse one last time, confirming the path is real. You nod. &quot;This is it. Let’s go.&quot;
[[Enter the gap]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Enter the gap" tags="" position="1925,350" size="100,100">You take a deep breath, your dowsing rods pulsing in your hands as you approach the gap. The walls tremble slightly, and the flickering lights grow erratic, casting strange shadows across the narrow passage. With no time to waste and no other options left, you gesture to Bubba.

“Let’s go,” you say, stepping into the gap.

As you squeeze through, the air around you feels different—heavier, colder. You hear strange whispers, like distant voices calling your name from all directions. Bubba follows you, but his steps falter. “I don’t like this, Em,” he mutters, but it’s too late to turn back now.

The gap leads you deeper into the labyrinthine structure, and as you go, the walls seem to close in around you. Your footsteps echo unnervingly, and the faint hum of the machinery becomes a distant thrum beneath your feet. You’re getting closer to something, but you’re not sure what.

Suddenly, the passageway opens up into a large chamber. At first, it appears empty, but then you notice something that makes your blood run cold.

In the center of the room stands a massive figure—hulking, twisted, and strangely mechanical. It seems to be a grotesque fusion of flesh and metal, a distorted amalgamation of the facility’s many secrets. The figure’s eyes are dark, cold voids that seem to devour the light, and its limbs twitch erratically, as though testing the space around it. The figure’s presence is overpowering, and the air feels thick with a palpable sense of dread.

Before you can react, a voice booms through the chamber, deep and guttural, vibrating through your bones.

“INTERLOPERS.”

The ground beneath you shakes as the figure steps forward, its heavy footfalls echoing. Bubba stumbles back, his eyes wide with terror. “Em… What the hell is that thing?”

The figure lunges forward, its metallic limbs scraping the floor with an unnatural screech. It&#39;s faster than it should be for its size. A cold wave of energy washes over you, and you instinctively reach for your weapon.

“YOU HAVE COME TOO FAR. NOW YOU WILL PAY.”

The room flickers and distorts as the figure moves to strike, its massive, claw-like hand swinging through the air with deadly precision. You barely manage to dodge, the sharp edges of its appendages narrowly missing you.

[[id: clawfight-&gt;Prepare to fight]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Inspect the equipment" tags="" position="1525,450" size="100,100">A terminal in the corner of the room flickers to life, displaying a message that seems to be addressing you:

&quot;ACCESS GRANTED.
WELCOME TO THE DATA CORE.&quot;

Suddenly, a low mechanical voice fills the room, and the terminal begins to relay unsettling data:

&quot;Subjugation complete. External subject: Em, located. Commence observation and monitoring.&quot;

A feeling of dread sweeps over you. This wasn’t a random shift in location. You’ve been moved to a secure, isolated data facility, and it seems like you’ve been identified as an “external subject.”

What is this place? Who or what is monitoring you? And more importantly, what is your role in all of this?

You hear the soft clicking of machinery around you, like gears winding into motion. A countdown begins on the terminal’s screen: &quot;5… 4… 3…&quot;

[[Try pressing buttons at random]]
[[Let the coundown finish]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Try pressing buttons at random" tags="" position="1825,525" size="100,100">You stare at the metallic panel next to the terminal, your hand hovering over a large, unmarked button. You’ve been trapped here for what feels like too long, and the pressure of the strange atmosphere is starting to get to you. The countdown, the messages, the cold, sterile space—it all feels like a trap.

With no other options and a growing sense of urgency, you press the button at random.

A sudden, deafening mechanical whirring fills the room, and the lights flicker above you. For a moment, everything goes black, and your heart races, but then a sharp, artificial voice fills the room again, echoing in every corner:

&quot;ERROR. RANDOM INPUT DETECTED.&quot;

The walls around you tremble, and the floor beneath your feet seems to shift, causing you to stumble. Your mind races, but there’s no time to second-guess your decision now. The whirring intensifies, and a series of high-pitched tones begin to play—like a computer trying to process something it doesn’t understand.

Suddenly, a large compartment in the floor opens with a hydraulic hiss, revealing a long, dark shaft leading down into an unknown abyss. The edges of the shaft are lined with bright, flickering lights, and there’s a faint sound coming from deep within—a low, almost rhythmic thumping, like something large moving down there.

Before you can fully comprehend what’s happening, a mechanical arm extends from the ceiling and grabs you by the arm with unnatural strength, pulling you toward the shaft’s edge.

&quot;WARNING. UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED. SYSTEM ERROR.&quot;

Bubba’s voice cuts through the panic, and you turn to see him stumbling out of nowhere, as if he just materialized back into existence. “Em! What did you do?” he yells, trying to reach you.

The mechanical arm is tightening its grip, and the lights flicker again. It’s like the entire room is alive now, responding to your mistake.

&quot;SUBJECT IN DANGER. AUTOMATED PROTOCOL ACTIVATED.&quot;

You have a split second to act before the arm drags you into the abyss below.

[[Try to free yourself from the mechanical arm -&gt;Wrestling]]
[[Push Bubba away to keep him safe -&gt;Stealth]]

For a few seconds, all is silent. Then, you hear the hum of nearby machines intensify, as if they are waking up. You stand frozen in place, not sure if you’re meant to run, hide, or prepare for what’s to come.

The walls flicker momentarily, displaying strange symbols and diagrams—none of them making any sense to you. It’s as if this whole place is meant to observe or store information about you. The atmosphere shifts once more, colder now, almost sterile in its precision.

You move to the terminal to try to interact, but before you can, another message appears:

“EXTERNAL SUBJECT. YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED. INITIATING TESTING SEQUENCE.”
[[id: testending-&gt; Testing ending]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name=" Testing ending" tags="" position="1650,825" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Face the dark force" tags="" position="825,975" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Wrestling" tags="" position="1800,675" size="100,100">You summon every ounce of strength you have and pull at the mechanical arm with all your might. It’s cold, rigid, and unnaturally strong, but you manage to twist your arm free just in time. You fall backward onto the floor as the arm retracts, and the compartment below you shuts with a loud slam.

Bubba rushes to your side, breathless. “That was way too close, Em.”
[[Wait]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Stealth" tags="" position="1925,675" size="100,100">In the heat of the moment, you quickly duck and roll away from the mechanical arm’s reach, managing to escape its grip just before it pulls you into the abyss. Bubba yells in alarm, but you’re already on your feet, hidden beneath the shadow of a nearby terminal.

The arm retracts, and the system seems to reset, the hum of machinery dulling slightly. You’re safe—for now.

“What the hell was that?” Bubba mutters, eyes wide with disbelief.

“I think we’ve made it angry,” you reply, still feeling the aftershocks of the close call.
[[Wait]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Cybernetics" tags="" position="2050,675" size="100,100">You don’t hesitate for a second. You activate your cybernetic implant and attempt to send a counter-signal to the system controlling the mechanical arm. The room buzzes with energy as you desperately try to override its protocols.

The arm stutters, its movement slowing as the system attempts to recalibrate, but your implants manage to inject a scrambling signal. For a moment, it seems like the arm is going to stop. It’s struggling, its movements jerky as if it’s malfunctioning.

And then—success. The arm lets go, retracting sharply into the ceiling.

&quot;ACCESS TERMINATED. SYSTEM RESET.&quot;

The lights flicker one last time before returning to normal. You and Bubba are left standing in the now-still room, your heart still pounding from the ordeal.

Bubba looks at you with wide eyes. “That was close. Too close.”
[[Wait]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Wait" tags="" position="1925,800" size="100,100">The room, now quiet and unnervingly still, feels suffocating. The sterile white walls glisten under the harsh artificial light, and the strange hum of machinery is the only sound that fills the air. It’s as if the entire facility has paused in response to your recent interference, waiting for your next move.

Bubba’s footsteps echo as he paces nervously. “We need to get out of here, Em. Whatever this place is, it’s not something we should stick around to figure out.”

You agree, but you’re not sure where to go. Every direction seems to lead into the same oppressive void of machinery. The doors are sealed, the walls unyielding. But just as you start to lose hope, something changes.

The floor beneath you shudders once more, not violently like before, but with a soft, mechanical precision. Then, the wall to your left slides open with a quiet hiss, revealing a narrow passageway bathed in dim light. It’s an exit, or at least, it seems to be.

Without a word, you and Bubba move toward it, the air growing colder as you approach. The passageway stretches ahead, its walls lined with more of those strange symbols you encountered earlier—this time, they appear less cryptic, almost familiar. As you step forward, you notice that the walls seem to pulse with a faint, rhythmic energy, like a heartbeat.

The passage narrows further as you proceed, the silence in the space broken only by the sound of your footsteps and Bubba’s heavy breathing. Time feels warped here, and every moment seems to stretch longer than it should.

Finally, after what feels like an eternity, you reach a large, sealed door at the end of the passage. A keypad is mounted beside it, its screen glowing a soft green. You approach it cautiously, your hand hovering over the interface. You don’t have much time, but the message displayed on the screen seems to imply it’s meant for you:

“ACCESS GRANTED.
SUBJECT: EM. EXIT READY.”

A sharp metallic click fills the air as the door unlocks, and it slides open smoothly, revealing an entirely different world on the other side.

The air is thick with the scent of fresh grass and salt from the sea. You’re standing on the edge of a cliff, overlooking an expansive landscape—an unfamiliar coast. Below, a city sprawls across the horizon, ancient in design, yet alive with movement. It feels strange, out of place, but you’re certain it’s the exit you were searching for.

Bubba stares in disbelief, his voice barely a whisper. &quot;What… what is this place?&quot;

You step forward, the wind picking up as it whips around you. The world beyond feels like a strange blend of the real and the unreal, a place that doesn’t belong in the same reality you’ve known.

With no other choice but to move forward, you and Bubba leave the data center behind, stepping into the unknown.

The door slides shut behind you, and the world you’ve escaped from vanishes without a trace. You’re left in a new place, its mysteries waiting to unfold.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Prepare to fight" tags="" position="2050,475" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="Ignore the feeling of being watched and just enjoy camping with Bubba" tags="" position="625,475" size="100,100">You and Bubba settle into the strange camping spot you’ve made, the hum of the floor beneath your feet echoing in the silence. The atmosphere feels almost dreamlike, as though time doesn’t flow properly here. You take a deep breath, trying to shake the feeling that you’re being watched, but the eeriness of the place lingers.

As you get up to explore, you notice a few strange items left scattered around the shelves—trinkets that seem to radiate a soft, almost magical glow. You wander over to one shelf and find a small, intricately carved box. It seems old, maybe centuries old, but it’s strangely preserved, as if untouched by time.

“Look at this,” you murmur, holding it up to Bubba. He steps closer, his curiosity piqued.

“What is it? A puzzle box or something?”

You shake your head, unsure. As you carefully open it, you find an antique compass inside. But this isn’t any normal compass—the needle spins erratically, pointing in random directions.

“Is it broken?” Bubba asks.

You test it. The compass seems to react to the environment, moving erratically with the hum of the floor. You tuck it into your bag, feeling a strange connection to the device. Whatever this store is, it seems to be more than just a place—it might be a doorway to something larger.

After a few days of scavenging and exploring, the two of you decide to pack up and continue. You find some more strange items, including a delicate, glowing stone, which you keep in your pocket for later. The campsite feels like a small pocket of peace in the otherwise unsettling store.

Finally, after three days, you feel a shift in the air. The once-shifting walls now feel more stable, and you find a door that had been hidden behind a series of shelves. It opens easily, leading you outside to the bright, welcoming light of the outside world. You’re free at last.

You exchange a relieved smile with Bubba as you step into the fresh air, the strange items from the shelves safely tucked away. Whatever this place was, it’s over now.

Bubba, your trusty companion, hovers at your side. Across from you sits Rico, a Swedish enchantress known for her cold demeanor and powerful spells. Today, you are in court fighting for the right to use GenericFireball, a spell of mass destruction that both of you claim ownership of.

The judge, a giant floating eye named Jörn, gazes at both of you with an unblinking stare. The courtroom is filled with magical scribes, agents from the Mages Guild, and curious onlookers from all across em.Path.

&quot;Em, you may present your case,&quot; Jörn says in a booming, disembodied voice.

You take a deep breath and step forward.

You can sense the enchantment lingering on it, but you still need a solid rebuttal. Bubba, ever the tactician, whispers something about the hidden clauses in ancient documents.

The contract seems ordinary at first glance, but you know there’s magic involved. You focus your attention and try to use Cryptography to decode the true meaning behind the lines of text.

You will be banned from using magic in this court for the next seven cycles, and your case is dismissed. GenericFireball is still claimed by Rico.&quot;

Bubba looks at you with concern, his arms folded, but you can only laugh weakly. The lesson here is clear: showing off your magic in court, especially when you&#39;re angry, can have unexpected consequences.

While you may have lost the case, there’s a silver lining: Rico has no legal hold over the spell now, but you’ve also lost the privilege to wield it in court. In time, the chaos will die down, but you&#39;ll need to rebuild your reputation and ensure that your next spell is far more carefully controlled.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Plead for mercy" tags="" position="1150,500" size="100,100">With the guards surrounding you, you can barely speak over the cacophony of whispers and gasps from the crowd.

The giant floating eye that is Jörn blinks rapidly before it is knocked completely out of its magical housing. The room erupts into chaos as the enchantments around the courtroom shatter.

Jörn, now more of a confused orb than a judge, floats toward you, seething with fury. &quot;You dare attack the court?!&quot;

Before you can explain or apologize, several magic-armed guards rush forward, binding you in a magical restraint.

[[Plead for mercy]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Use spell" tags="" position="1425,400" size="100,100">In the middle of your final argument, you decide to demonstrate the sheer power of GenericFireball to prove its potential for public good. After all, showing how the spell works could make the court see the value in allowing anyone to use it.

With a deep breath, you gather the magic within you, calling upon the words of power: &quot;GenericFireball!&quot; You throw the spell into the air with a flourish.

But something goes terribly wrong.

The spell, intended to explode harmlessly into a dazzling display of light, swerves off-course, swirling with unexpected force. Before anyone can react, it hurls directly toward the floating eye of Jörn, the judge.

Choice 5: Try to redirect the spell

You realize your mistake too late and try to divert the spell with a hasty Transmutation charm. But it&#39;s too much for you to control.

[[Transmutation, 50, The spell fizzles and explodes in an uncontrolled burst.

You feel the spell wash over you, trying to cloud your mind with confusion. Rico is using Spiritism to mentally overwhelm you, but you won’t let her win that easily.

Choice 3: Resist Rico’s manipulation

You can sense the ethereal pull of Rico’s influence. You know you need to counter her magic or risk losing your grip on the case. You focus on your inner strength and prepare to fight back with your own Spiritism.

The camper shakes violently, and the landscape outside blurs into a swirling vortex. After what feels like an eternity, everything goes still. You find yourself in the quiet expanse of space, far from any familiar stars.

Through their telepathic communication, they express a deep curiosity about Earth and its inhabitants, their knowledge of biology far beyond human comprehension. They make it clear that their interest lies in the genetic diversity of humans, and in exchange for a sample, they’ll assist in bringing you back to your home planet.

Reluctantly, you agree. &quot;Fine,&quot; you say, &quot;but be careful with it. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re going to do with it, but I&#39;ll trust you.&quot;

The beings send a wave of gratitude through your mind, their understanding of your biology growing clearer with each passing second. They study your body in intricate detail, mapping your DNA and analyzing the various components of your human form. The process is surreal, as if you’re connected to them on a level beyond the physical, your mind intertwined with theirs.

Once the sample is collected, they gently set you back down on the floor of their ship. Without warning, they place their hands on your temples and you feel a strange shift. A warmth floods your senses, and the sensation of floating begins to fade.

As they release you, the beings convey an image of Earth—its blue oceans and sprawling continents—vivid and clear in your mind. The ship hums and vibrates gently, its alien technology humming to life as a portal opens before you. Through the shimmering threshold, you see the familiar sight of your camper parked near a forest clearing.

&quot;Your world,&quot; one of the aliens communicates in your mind, &quot;has many wonders. We now understand your biology... and we will return you home.&quot;

With a soft, almost musical hum, the ship drops you and your camper onto solid ground, your feet back on the soil of Earth. The portal fades, and you’re left standing in the quiet, familiar woods. Bubba, who had been anxiously pacing outside, looks up in shock as you reappear.

&quot;Well,&quot; Bubba says, glancing at the now-vanishing alien ship, &quot;that was one wild ride.&quot;

You shake your head in disbelief, trying to process everything. But one thing is clear: the aliens now understand the complexity of human life, and thanks to your help, they’ve gained insights that might shape their future encounters with Earth.

As the camper hums to life, you feel a strange sense of connection to the stars. The universe, it seems, is much bigger than you ever imagined.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Signal ship" tags="" position="1225,650" size="100,100">The human-made ship responds and agrees to guide you to the nearest station.

[[End -&gt;Return home]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Observe ship" tags="" position="1525,600" size="100,100">The hum of the ship grows louder, and soon, it hovers just within reach of your camper. It’s sleek, almost clinical in design, like something out of a futuristic dream. A hatch opens with a soft hiss, and a group of figures step out, their suits a strange combination of high-tech armor and mundane everyday wear. They glance around, taking in the surroundings with the sharp eyes of experienced travelers.

&quot;Didn&#39;t expect to find anyone out here,&quot; one of them says, his voice surprisingly calm, like he’s making casual conversation.

You step forward, wariness making you pause before you speak. “What is this? Who are you?”

The man tilts his head, blinking slowly as though considering the question. “Oh, right. You haven’t heard, have you? About the news?”

“News?” You ask, confusion creeping into your voice. “What news?”
[[Ask for delucidations]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Take artifact" tags="" position="1800,450" size="100,100">You carefully reach out and grasp the pulsating artifact. The moment your fingers touch it, a strange warmth spreads through your hand, and you feel an odd hum reverberating up your arm. The device is small, about the size of a marble, and it’s made of a smooth, metallic substance that seems to shimmer with an iridescent glow. As you hold it, the intricate patterns carved into its surface seem to shift and change, as if they are alive.

But before you can fully examine it, the artifact begins to react. Its glow intensifies, and with a sudden, sharp pulse, it contracts, shrinking down to the size of a pebble in your hand. The hum grows louder, a high-pitched frequency that almost makes your ears ring. Then, just as quickly as it shrank, it vanishes from your grasp in a flash of light, leaving your hand empty.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Activate portal" tags="" position="625,850" size="100,100">Em’s fingers hover over the ancient console, her heart racing as she attempts to initiate the unstable portal. The machine hums to life with a violent shudder, the air around her vibrating with energy. Suddenly, a burst of light erupts from the console, and the portal swirls open with a thunderous roar.

Just as she’s about to step through, the light flickers and distorts. A message flashes across the screen: Warning: Temporal Distortion Detected. Before she can react, a shadowy figure steps through the portal, its form distorted and flickering like a broken hologram. It locks eyes with her, its voice eerily familiar.

&quot;You shouldn’t have done that,&quot; the figure says, its voice hollow and strained. &quot;The portal wasn’t meant to bring you here…&quot;

Em stares in shock as the figure steps forward, revealing a version of herself, distorted and twisted, wearing a dark, tattered version of her witch robes. The figure smiles coldly, and as it raises its hand, the world around Em begins to unravel, the walls of the outpost flickering in and out of existence.

&quot;You&#39;ve just opened the door to your own destruction,&quot; the twisted version of herself says, and the portal begins to collapse, dragging her in with it.
[[id:selfbossfight-&gt;Face yourself]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Leave outpost" tags="" position="750,850" size="100,100">Em steps back from the console, her mind buzzing with the implications of what she’s just learned. The outpost, built by travelers from another dimension, was more than just a base—it was a staging ground for experiments with portals, a link to countless other worlds.

As she begins to gather her things, she notices a small, hidden compartment in the wall. Curiosity piqued, she opens it and finds a small, metallic object—a device that seems to pulse with an otherworldly energy. She doesn’t recognize it, but it feels important, like it was left specifically for her to find.

As she picks it up, the device activates, projecting a holographic map of interconnected dimensions. The last dot on the map blinks ominously, a line leading directly to Earth. But there’s something strange about it: the map’s path doesn&#39;t just lead to Earth—it points to a time before her own existence, a place in history that’s been erased from all records.

The map&#39;s final message appears: “The time loop has already begun. You are the key.”

Em stares at the projection, realization dawning on her. The portal wasn’t just a way to travel between dimensions—it was a way to rewrite time itself. But what does it mean for her, and why is she the one chosen to close the loop?

The device flickers off in her hands, leaving her with more questions than answers—and a chilling feeling that she&#39;s just scratched the surface of something far larger and far older than she ever imagined.
[[Go back to your travels]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Disarm alarm" tags="" position="950,750" size="100,100">Em rushes to the central control panel, her heart pounding as the blaring alarm echoes through the outpost. She scans the console, frantically pressing buttons and trying to read the unfamiliar symbols. Her breath comes in short bursts as she frantically searches for a way to stop the countdown. The screen flickers, showing a series of error messages and corrupted data, each more cryptic than the last.

&quot;Come on, come on!&quot; she mutters, trying to force the machine to cooperate.

As the seconds tick down, she pulls a lever in desperation. The alarm cuts out for a brief moment—just enough time for Em to think she’s succeeded. But before she can catch her breath, the console flashes a final message: &quot;Self-Destruct Engaged. Fail-safe override unavailable.&quot;

A sudden, low hum fills the room as the walls begin to shake, the countdown continuing without mercy.

Defeated, Em watches as the screen flashes one last, cryptic phrase before the entire system shuts down. &quot;Warning: Entity approaching from the Psychosphere. Initiating feedback loop.&quot;

A sudden, overwhelming sensation fills Em’s mind. It’s as though the very air around her is thickening, her vision blurring, and her thoughts being pulled in every direction at once. She hears it—a primal scream, raw and piercing, reverberating through the psychosphere. It’s not her scream. It’s not anyone’s. It’s a sound older than time itself, echoing through the fabric of reality.

Her body goes rigid, and her mind struggles to hold onto its sense of self. The scream intensifies, seeping deeper into her consciousness, like a distortion in the world that’s about to consume everything. But before she can process what’s happening, the world flickers and the adventure abruptly cuts off, leaving only the fading echo of that maddening sound.

The screen goes black.

More like... an inevitability. You’re standing in a very peculiar part of space, one that doesn’t quite obey the rules of physics or time. This region, the one you thought was just some forgotten patch of the universe... it’s the Great Attractor.”

You blink, the name like a sharp sting against the back of your skull. “The Great Attractor? What does that even mean?”

The woman, who had been silent up until now, steps forward, her gaze unsettlingly calm. “It’s a force, Em, one you can’t quite perceive unless you’ve been... touched by it. It’s a point in space that seems to draw everything in its vicinity toward it, bending the very fabric of reality around it. Galaxies, stars, even time and space—they all bend, warping and collapsing in its wake.”

“But... why here? Why us?” you ask, your breath catching as a sense of dread begins to creep up your spine.

The man shakes his head slowly. “You’re not just in the Great Attractor’s gravitational pull. You’re standing on the edge of something much worse.” His words hang in the air, heavy, like the weight of a door that’s about to open to something you can’t turn back from.

“Think of it like this,” the woman says, her voice dropping to a whisper, “The Great Attractor doesn’t just bend space. It feeds on it. It devours the moments, the experiences, the lives of those unfortunate enough to fall into its orbit. It is a demon of the desert—an entity that has no mercy, no understanding. It takes, but it doesn’t give back.”

Your stomach twists. The idea of a cosmic force, a silent, hungry beast that devours all that it touches, seems too unfathomable, too vast. But the more you hear, the more the air around you seems to press in, as though reality itself is suffocating under the weight of this revelation.

“This region of space,&quot; the man continues, “has been marked by the Great Attractor for eons. It’s not a place of exploration or wonder. It’s the edge of an abyss—a place where time, reality, and identity collapse into an endless void. That’s why so many end up here, lost... consumed.”

The woman pauses, her eyes narrowing, almost pityingly, as she looks at you. “You’re not just lost in space, Em. You’re lost in something much darker. You’ve already felt its pull. That disorientation you’ve experienced? That confusion? It’s the Attractor playing with your perception. And it’s just the beginning.”

Suddenly, a cold shiver crawls up your spine. You can almost feel the Attractor’s presence now—not just as a force of physics, but as something far older, far more malevolent. A consciousness, a primal scream from beyond the edges of space and time, echoing across your very being.

“It’s not just a cosmic anomaly,” you murmur, the realization creeping into your mind. “It’s alive... it’s waiting...”

The woman nods solemnly, her voice barely above a whisper. “The Great Attractor is not just a thing. It’s a demon. A desert god. A void that thrives on the very essence of reality itself. And it has claimed this region, bound it to its will. Whatever you’ve experienced out here—those strange, fractured realities? They are its doing. Its hunger, reaching out across dimensions, pulling everything into its maw.”

And as you stand there, staring into the infinite void, the strangest thought strikes you—the Great Attractor has always been here. Watching. Watching.Watching.. It knew you’d come.

And then, as the ship disappears into the void, the last thing you hear is the distant, hollow scream of a being that has never known mercy, calling you into the black, endless desert.

That night, the kitten curls up next to you in bed. As you drift off, the dream is strange—its glowing eyes and soft purring fill your mind, and though it doesn’t speak, you feel as if it’s trying to communicate.

You wake in the night to find the kitten staring out the window, eyes wide and glowing faintly. It meows softly, a sound that resonates deep in your chest, as if echoing across dimensions.

Bubba looks around, his face a mix of shock and sorrow. &quot;This place...it used to be so beautiful. Now look at it,&quot; he says, his voice barely above a whisper.

You nod, feeling the weight of the destruction around you. The acid rain has left everything corroded and twisted, from the remnants of buildings to the skeletal trees that dot the horizon. The earth itself seems to weep as you walk, every step echoing with a faint, hissing sound.

&quot;We need to find shelter,&quot; you say, eyeing the ominous clouds above. &quot;The rain could start again at any moment.&quot;

[[search, 10, The landscape is desolate, but you might find remnants of a structure-&gt;Search for shelter]] [[observation, 8, You notice strange, untouched pockets of land amidst the devastation-&gt;Investigate the untouched areas]] [[intuition, 7, Something feels off about the remaining structures-&gt;Avoid the structures and find a natural shelter]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Search for shelter" tags="" position="200,400" size="100,100">You and Bubba pick your way through the wasteland, searching for any kind of shelter. The acidic mist in the air stings your skin, and the ground beneath your feet feels unstable, as if it could crumble at any moment.

After what feels like hours, you spot a dilapidated building in the distance. Its walls are partially melted, but it looks like it might still offer some protection. You approach cautiously, the ground crunching under your boots.

[[ignore the feeling of unease and head inside-&gt;Enter the building]] [[caution, 12, You’ve heard stories of toxic remnants in such places-&gt;Check for hazards first]] [[bravery, 5, You see movement inside and decide to investigate-&gt;Investigate the movement]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Investigate the untouched areas" tags="" position="325,400" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Avoid the structures and find a natural shelter" tags="" position="450,400" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Enter the building" tags="" position="75,525" size="100,100">You and Bubba step inside the building, the door hanging loosely on its hinges. The interior is dark and damp, with the smell of decay hanging heavily in the air. The walls ooze with the remnants of the acidic rain, creating an eerie, otherworldly ambiance.

&quot;We should stay here for the night,&quot; you suggest, setting down your pack. &quot;It’s not much, but it’s better than being out in the open.&quot;

Bubba nods, setting up a small camp in the corner. As you sit down, you hear a faint, almost imperceptible hum coming from somewhere deep within the building.

[[ignore the sound and try to rest-&gt;Rest for the night]] [[investigation, 8, The hum could mean something important-&gt;Follow the sound]] [[caution, 5, The building might hold more than you realize-&gt;Prepare for an encounter]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Check for hazards first" tags="" position="200,525" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Investigate the movement" tags="" position="325,525" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Rest for the night" tags="" position="0,650" size="100,100">You decide to ignore the strange hum and focus on getting some rest. You and Bubba huddle together, trying to find some comfort in the desolate surroundings. The building provides a small measure of protection against the acidic environment outside.

As you close your eyes, the distant hum fades into the background, and you drift off into an uneasy sleep. The night is filled with strange dreams of a world beyond this devastated landscape, where nature thrives and humanity has found a way to coexist with the elements.

When you wake, the world outside seems a little less hostile, and you feel a renewed sense of hope. Maybe there&#39;s still a chance to find a way to heal this land and rebuild.

[[continue...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Follow the sound" tags="" position="75,650" size="100,100">You decide to investigate the strange hum, curiosity getting the better of you. As you move deeper into the building, the sound grows louder and more distinct, like the thrum of a hidden engine. Bubba follows closely, his eyes scanning the shadows.

You eventually reach a hidden chamber, its walls lined with strange, glowing machinery. The hum emanates from a central device, pulsating with an otherworldly energy. The air is thick with a palpable sense of power, and you feel a strange pull toward the device.

[[inspect the device-&gt;Approach the device]] [[caution, 8, This might be dangerous-&gt;Keep your distance and observe]] [[curiosity, 5, You’re drawn to the device and want to know more-&gt;Touch the device]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Prepare for an encounter" tags="" position="300,675" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="continue..." tags="" position="0,775" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Approach the device" tags="" position="75,775" size="100,100">You step closer to the device, its glow illuminating your face. The hum vibrates through your bones, and you feel a strange connection to the machine. Bubba watches nervously, his hand hovering over his weapon.

&quot;Careful, Em,&quot; he warns. &quot;We don’t know what this thing is.&quot;

You nod, but your curiosity drives you forward. The device seems ancient and yet advanced beyond anything you’ve seen. As you reach out, your fingers brush against its surface, and a surge of energy courses through you.

The room around you shifts, the walls melting away to reveal a vast, underground network of tunnels and chambers. The device hums louder, as if welcoming you to its depths.

A smooth voice breaks through the static, promoting a luxury brand with slogans that feel... strangely compelling. Em turns up the volume and is startled to hear faint whispers underneath the main ad, repeating phrases in an arcane tongue. Her ears prick up—this isn’t just regular marketing.

    Action: Listen closely and try to decode the hidden message.
        [[cryptography, 20, You can&#39;t make out the words, but they stir something deep within you -&gt; Focus even harder, tuning into the whispers]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name=" Focus even harder, tuning into the whispers" tags="" position="562.5,375" size="100,100">The whispers become clearer, and Em catches words like “desire,” “submit,” and “consume” repeated in haunting, rhythmic patterns. Her occult training kicks in, and she realizes these phrases are ancient mantras from the Book of Craves, a text used in dark magic to induce compulsive behavior.

A flash of insight hits her: the Hypercapitalist Collective has found a way to embed occult symbols into advertisements, bypassing the mind’s natural defenses to encourage unthinking consumption.

    Action: Pull over to investigate more thoroughly.
        [[arcane insight, 15, You feel a wave of dread as the true nature of the ad reveals itself -&gt; Dig deeper into the symbols embedded in the broadcast]]

Its function is twofold: amplifying magical energy and encoding that energy into visual or auditory messages. The Arcane Occulus is incredibly rare and incredibly illegal.

Bubba whimpers, sensing Em’s worry. This device could manipulate huge swathes of the population, making them obsessively loyal to the brand or cause that wields it. It’s a weaponized form of occult advertising, an instrument for mass manipulation.

    Action: Track down the source of the broadcast.
        [[electronics, 30, You triangulate the broadcast to a corporate skyscraper owned by the Hypercapitalist Collective -&gt; Approach the building under cover of night]]

The Arcane Occulus is cycling through these ads, targeting listeners based on their mood, financial status, and even their astrological signs. Em realizes that this conspiracy is not only complex but highly personalized—a dark pinnacle of Hypercapitalist advertising.

    Action: Contact a friend in the Archive Foundation for help.
        [[diplomacy, 15, Your contact agrees to meet you at a secure location to trade intel -&gt; Rendezvous with your friend to gain more insight]]

She sneaks through a hallway lined with screens, each playing hypnotic ads that target viewers&#39; deepest insecurities.

In a secure room, she finds the Arcane Occulus—a crystal sphere mounted on an elaborate golden stand, radiating a dense, dark energy. The room is silent except for the low hum of the device, pulsing like a heartbeat.

    Action: Attempt to disable the Arcane Occulus.

Security bursts in, but the shattered device lies in pieces, its power forever broken.

She realizes that these are wards designed to protect the device from tampering—likely a failsafe from the Hypercapitalists to ensure their plan can’t be undone. But she notices a single sigil that seems out of place: Obliviscere, a rune for “forgetting.”

Realization dawns. The device doesn’t just promote consumption; it slowly erases memories of the ads from viewers’ minds, allowing them to watch again and again as if for the first time.

    Action: Reverse the Obliviscere rune to disrupt the device’s magic.

On the screens, the advertisements shift erratically, flashing between their normal content and the dark symbols embedded within.

In horror, Em realizes that instead of making people forget, the device is now broadcasting these occult symbols openly, creating a chaotic, dangerous influence on the minds of anyone watching.

Security alarms blare, and you hear the Collective executives shouting in panic.

    Action: Escape before you’re detected.

You’re driving down the road in your camper, Bubba lazily eating a sandwich next to you, when suddenly—BOOM!

Out of nowhere, the sky turns pink. No, not a nice pink. A crazy pink! It&#39;s like someone spilled too much paint in the heavens. Your camper rattles. You look out the window and see something... massive.

It’s Orodinc’s mascot!

A GIANT APE! And it’s absolutely going bananas.

He’s smashing cars with his oversized fists. He’s pulling buildings out of the ground like they’re made of marshmallows. And… wait, hold up… he’s eating the global economy.

You blink. The whole global economy? That’s a lot of money, and it’s probably not good for his digestion. But you know what? The ape is hungry, and there’s only one thing on his mind: MORE ORODINC! And if he doesn&#39;t get it, well... he’s going to wreck everything in his path.

[[Empathy, 40, The ape stares at you, then roars and stomps on the nearest bank! There goes the economy again. -&gt; You try to reason with the ape, offering him a giant basket of Orodinc to calm him down!]]

[[Cooking, 50, You decide to make the world&#39;s biggest sandwich to feed the ape. You grab all the Orodinc you can find and pile it high.

You quickly take Bubba’s hand and zoom off towards the nearest Orodinc factory. When you get there, you find the workers panicking, running in circles, and throwing tiny bags of Orodinc into the air in a wild frenzy. They’re not sure what to do. The ape is so hungry!

What do you do?

[[Cooking, 70, You get an idea! You can bake a gigantic Orodinc pie to satisfy the ape&#39;s hunger. This will require serious baking skills, but you’re up for the challenge! Fail: You burn the pie, and now the whole factory is covered in ash. The ape is still hungry. -&gt; Try another tactic!]]

[[Empathy, 90, You decide to simply sit down and talk to the ape. You tell him how important he is to the world and how Orodinc isn’t the only thing that can make him feel good.

The ape blinks. His eyes fill with joy. And then, the most magical thing happens.

The sky is overcast, the air thick with a strange sense of foreboding. They decide to stop at a tiny, seemingly ordinary shop tucked away in a small clearing. The sign above the door reads “Curiosities and Curses.”

Inside, the shelves are lined with odd trinkets and strange objects—glistening stones, dusty books, and jars filled with what look like liquid shadows. But one item catches your eye: a plain, innocuous-looking box made of delicate, crinkled paper. It’s sitting on a pedestal, glowing faintly.

Curious, you reach out to touch it, but the moment your fingers brush the surface of the box, you feel a jolt of magic shoot through your body. Your heart races as a strange sensation begins to crawl up your arm.

What happens next?

&quot;Bubba!&quot; you shout. &quot;Something&#39;s happening! I think I&#39;m turning into a paper box!&quot;

Bubba looks at you with wide eyes. &quot;What?! Are you serious? You look… different!&quot;

You check your arm and notice it’s slowly becoming flat, like the surface of a cardboard box. You try to move, but you feel stiff and heavy, the change creeping up your body.

[[Medicine, 60, You try to stabilize yourself, looking for any signs of the curse’s origins and how it might be stopped. Fail: You struggle to maintain your human form, but your body continues to flatten and stiffen. -&gt; Look for something in the shop that might help]]

You begin to feel your feet turn into flat, papery surfaces, your toes and legs shrinking away. The box-like sensation spreads up your body. The more you try to fight it, the faster the transformation progresses. Panic sets in.

&quot;Bubba, hurry!&quot; you shout, but your voice is becoming muffled, as if your mouth is turning into paper.

“I found it!” Bubba exclaims, holding up a faded scroll. &quot;It says here that a curse like this is caused by touching a cursed object with the power of an ancient deity! But you can break it if you make a sacrifice at the spot where the curse began.”

You nod, trying to keep yourself together, though it’s hard as your body continues to flatten and stiffen.

Bubba runs around the shop, grabbing things off shelves and looking for something that might work. He tosses a few items aside: a crystal, a feather, a glowing vial.

&quot;Maybe this will work?&quot; Bubba says, holding up a small black stone. It’s smooth and cold to the touch, and as you grab it, you feel a brief, intense jolt of magic. The transformation seems to slow, but you can’t help but feel like it’s not enough.

“Whew, that was close,” you breathe, flexing your fingers. “I was starting to think I was going to be a box forever.”

Bubba grins. “Well, at least you don’t have to worry about packing anymore.”

The air is thick with the scent of gasoline, and shadows linger around the edges of every building. Bubba mutters, “Not the kind of place I’d choose for a vacation, Em. What’s got you interested here?”

The name Enrico Mattei flashes across your mind—a figure shrouded in both controversy and legend, especially in these parts. Mattei’s death decades ago was officially ruled an accident, but rumors of the petromafia and petrodemons have long lingered. You’ve heard whispers that the truth lies buried somewhere around here, waiting to be uncovered.

His eyes dart to Bubba, then back to you, as if sizing you up.

“Passing through?” he asks, his voice gruff. You notice a faint, almost nervous tremor in his voice as he speaks.

Bubba shivers, glancing around. “Something’s wrong here, Em. I feel it.”

As you reach a secluded area, you spot strange symbols carved into the rocks and an ancient oil well spewing dark fumes into the air. The markings remind you of demon-summoning rituals, but with a peculiar petrochemical twist.

Mattei once stood up against the powerful oil cartels, but his enemies had deep pockets and darker allies. His death remains suspicious—a plane crash with evidence tampered and witnesses silenced.

Bubba leans in, “If the petromafia was involved, do you think they… summoned something?”

He threatened the oil monopolies, and they didn’t like that one bit. People say… it wasn’t just the petromafia involved. Dark things, things beyond human control, were set loose to deal with him.”

You catch Bubba’s wide-eyed glance. “You mean… demons?”

The attendant’s face goes pale. “Petrodemons, summoned to curse him and anyone who dared dig too deep.”

These marks are laced with dark enchantments meant to call forth petrodemons, bound to haunt and destroy the enemies of the petromafia.

Bubba’s face pales. “Someone’s been keeping these demons close to control whoever dares step out of line.”

A cold breeze fills the room, and the candles flicker. A faint voice whispers, “They… they used something darker than I could imagine… petromafia… petrodemons…”

The spirit’s voice fades in and out, but you catch fragments of words—summoning, betrayal, cursed.

The attendant’s eyes dart around nervously, then he relents, whispering, “They say Mattei tried to strike a deal with powers far darker than the oil companies. When he crossed them, they summoned something ancient, bound to the oil wells. It wasn’t just an accident… it was retribution.”

A shiver runs down your spine as he finishes. The petromafia didn’t just want Mattei gone—they cursed him.

The markings flicker, resisting at first, but then they fade, leaving only faint traces behind.

A shudder ripples through the earth, and a low growl echoes in the distance. Bubba’s voice is barely a whisper, “Em… did you hear that?”

Bubba grips your arm, his face pale. “Maybe we should get out of here, Em…”

But you sense something ancient and restless, bound to the ground below. This might be your only chance to confront a petrodaemon in its natural territory.

He eyes the talisman skeptically but eventually nods, pocketing it. “There’s one well deep in the forest, near the mountain’s base. It’s the darkest one of all—some say it’s where they first summoned the petrodemons.”

Armed with new knowledge, you and Bubba head toward the forest, feeling the air grow colder with each step.

As you reach the edge of the forest, a faint rumble shakes the earth, as if the spirits themselves are restless. You realize that unearthing the petromafia’s secrets might lead you deeper into a web of darkness than you anticipated, but your curiosity burns as brightly as ever.

A thick, sulfurous fog rises from the ground, swirling into the shape of a creature with blazing eyes and a molten core. The petrodaemon speaks, its voice rumbling through the valley.

“WHY… DO YOU DISTURB MY DOMAIN?”

You gulp, but stand firm, determined to uncover the truth about Mattei.

The petrodaemon reveals the truth in cryptic terms: “A pact sealed with fire, a betrayal punished by oil and flame.” Its voice fades as it retreats back into the earth, leaving you with a haunting sense of Mattei’s final moments. The petromafia’s reach was deeper than you imagined, spanning both mortal and infernal realms.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Piece together clues from Mattei’s past that connect him to supernatural forces" tags="" position="475,1200" size="100,100">The more you dig through the clues, the more certain you become. Mattei’s stance against oil monopolies put him at odds with powerful enemies, but his death seemed to trigger strange phenomena around these oil wells. Some locals even spoke of “fire-breathing shadows” appearing near the crash site shortly after his death.

You realize Mattei’s fate was sealed by more than just human hands. You and Bubba glance at each other, a silent understanding passing between you—you’re dealing with something dark and deeply embedded in the land.

Mattei’s legacy isn’t just about a man or his fight—it’s about the ancient power that still festers beneath the ground. As you leave the town, you feel the weight of knowledge that Mattei’s sacrifice may have only delayed the inevitable darkness that binds the oil wells.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>

You give him a satisfied smirk. &quot;Sometimes, gaming needs to be saved from itself.&quot;

Bubba’s reaction: &quot;And from ostriches.&quot;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Passaggio senza titolo 1" tags="" position="725,550" size="100,100">Back in the camper, you and Bubba drive away from Pixel Tower, the night sky stretching before you. The shadow of the Ostrich Armor has been lifted, and gamers will live to see another day of glitch-free, ostrich-free quests.

Bubba’s final comment: &quot;So… what next? A campaign to stop microtransactions?&quot;

You chuckle, knowing that as long as absurd ideas keep coming, you and Bubba will always have work to do.

Just you, Bubba, and the open road. But, as with most things post-squishing, peace never lasts long.

You wake up in the camper, feeling… small. And oddly stiff. The world towers above you—Bubba’s boots, the camper table, even the crumbs on the floor look like boulders. It takes a moment to process what’s happened, and then it hits you like a bag of spell ingredients.

You’ve been turned into a pickle.

A literal, tiny, green, slightly damp pickle. You lie there, helpless, staring up at the camper ceiling. Bubba, who had been snacking on pickles last night, looks down and gasps.

“Em?! Is that you? As a…pickle?”

You feel the urge to sigh but have no mouth, so all you can do is lie there, staring at him in silent despair.

[[Observation, 20, You try to remember if you cast any strange spells last night, but being a pickle doesn’t exactly help your memory. -&gt; Let Bubba poke you for signs of life]]

[[Exploration, 15, You struggle to wriggle yourself around, hoping for a clue or sign nearby. -&gt; Try moving toward the edge of the table]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name=" Let Bubba poke you for signs of life" tags="" position="525,525" size="100,100">Bubba sets you gently on the camper table and pokes you with a hesitant finger. “This… doesn’t seem ideal, Em,” he says, frowning. “Why on earth would you turn yourself into a pickle?”

You would roll your eyes if you had eyes that moved. But no, here you are: a soggy, helpless pickle with no plan and no explanation.

“Well, we’ve got to fix this,” Bubba says. He opens his spellbook, which has grown worn from years of magical misadventures.

“Hold on,” he mumbles, flipping through the pages. “Maybe I’ll find a ReversePickleSpell somewhere in here…”

[[Cryptography, 25, The symbols in the spellbook look different from this briny perspective. -&gt; Hope Bubba figures out a spell to help you]]

[[Spiritism, 30, You try to channel some magic to guide him from within the jar. -&gt; Attempt to telepathically communicate directions to Bubba]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name=" Hope that Bubba figures out a spell to help you" tags="" position="525,650" size="100,100">Hours pass, and Bubba’s “research” consists mostly of flipping through pages, glancing back at you, and muttering under his breath. Just when you think he might finally be onto something, he suddenly grins.

“I’ve got it, Em! I know how to fix this. Just… give me a minute.”

But rather than crafting a spell, he lifts you—pickle body and all—and places you in a jar. The jar rolls as Bubba begins to sprint out of the camper, mumbling about something called a “Pickle Recon” plan. You’re not sure what’s going on, but it doesn’t feel reassuring.

Outside, you hear shouting—a group of raccoons, decked out in bizarre, makeshift armor, is congregating near the camper. Bubba barrels out, holding you high.

“BEHOLD! The Pickle Witch!”

The raccoons eye you warily, chittering to each other in confusion.

“Uh, Bubba? I don’t think this is gonna work,” you mutter to yourself, resigned to whatever bizarre path Bubba has chosen.

[[Intuition, 35, You sense the raccoons are unimpressed and slightly annoyed. -&gt; Watch helplessly as Bubba tries to negotiate with the raccoons]]

[[Spiritism, 40, You focus all your energy on trying to end this mess yourself. -&gt; Attempt to cast a desperate spell to transform back]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name=" Watch helplessly as Bubba tries to negotiate with the raccoons" tags="" position="525,775" size="100,100">The raccoons are clearly not buying Bubba’s pitch. They chitter and gesture aggressively with tiny, sharpened sticks, and it’s clear they have no intention of letting you off the hook.

Suddenly, one of the raccoons grabs the jar and rolls it out of Bubba’s hands. You tumble down a small hill, bouncing wildly. The raccoons cheer as you roll away, a helpless pickle in a jar, until finally, you stop at the bottom. There, you lie in the dirt, trapped in the glass.

Bubba scrambles down after you, apologizing profusely as he finally retrieves the jar.

“Sorry, Em,” he says. “That didn’t go… quite as planned.”

He looks back at the raccoons, who have now turned their attention to a suspicious-looking dumpster nearby.

[[Back to the camper, with Bubba promising to “do better next time” -&gt;End]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name=" Roll toward the portal and pray for the best" tags="" position="525,900" size="100,100">Gathering all your willpower, you manage to roll yourself just a few inches closer to the portal. The shimmering light grows brighter, and you feel a faint tug—a glimmer of hope that maybe this whole ordeal might finally come to an end.

You close your imaginary eyes, focusing on reversing the curse. Just as you reach the edge of the portal, a strange warmth envelops you, like stepping into sunlight.

In a flash, you’re back to your usual self, fully human and utterly relieved. Bubba comes barreling down the hill after you, looking both relieved and proud.

“I knew you’d figure it out, Em!” he says, throwing his arms around you.

You sigh, brushing the pickle brine off your sleeves. “Let’s never, ever mention this again, Bubba.”

“Deal,” he says with a grin. But you have a sinking feeling he won’t let you live this down anytime soon.

[[Back in the camper, savoring the relief of having limbs again-&gt;End]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="End" tags="" position="525,1025" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name=" Try moving toward the edge of the table" tags="" position="900,475" size="100,100">Instead of relying on magic or Bubba’s schemes, you wriggle as hard as you can, managing to tip the jar over. You roll yourself, inch by inch, toward the edge of the camper’s countertop and take a terrifying plunge down to the floor.

The jar shatters, leaving you free to roll across the floor, heading for an open door where the raccoons have left a portal device lying unattended.

This is it, you think. My escape.

With one last wriggle, you push yourself into the portal, and with a flash, you’re back in human form, standing in an empty field far from the camper. Bubba catches up, panting, as you dust yourself off.

“I knew you’d make it, Em,” he says with a grin. “I was, uh, getting the spell ready back in the camper.”

You roll your eyes. “Right. Sure you were.”

[[Walk back to the camper, laughing about the ridiculous adventure you just survived-&gt;End]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name=" Hope Bubba figures out a spell to help you" tags="" position="462.5,1150" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name=" Attempt to telepathically communicate directions to Bubba" tags="" position="587.5,1150" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name=" Attempt to cast a desperate spell to transform back" tags="" position="775,775" size="100,100">In a moment of sheer desperation, you focus every ounce of magical energy you have on trying to undo the curse. You’ve never cast a spell from within a pickle, but with em.Path’s strange rules, there’s a slim chance it might work.

You gather your strength, calling on every ounce of spirit energy you have left. The air around you shimmers, the jar vibrates, and suddenly—poof!—you’re back to normal.

You blink, feeling light-headed but grateful. Bubba stares at you, wide-eyed.

“It worked! You actually cast from… inside a pickle?!”

You nod, barely able to believe it yourself. “Let’s just… keep this between us, okay?”

Bubba grins. “Deal. But, Em?”

You raise an eyebrow.

“You were… kind of a big dill.”

You sigh, shaking your head. “Let’s go.”

[[Head back to the camper, ready to leave this ordeal behind-&gt;End]]</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>

The only problem? You’ve never been comfortable around puppets, and the mere sight of them gives you chills.

The crew hands you a script, but you can barely read it through your sweaty palms. Bubba, your ever-enthusiastic companion, is backstage, trying (and failing) to calm your nerves. You glance out at the stage, where the Muppets—who all look disturbingly lifelike—are ready to go.

The opening credits roll as you step in front of the cameras.

You stand there, trying to steady yourself, but the Muppets keep making weird, jerking motions, staring at you with their dead eyes. The music starts, and the camera zooms in on you, the host.

“Welcome to the show! I’m… Em, your host for the day!” you say, your voice wavering as the Muppets start cheerfully chanting, &quot;Em! Em! Em!&quot; You freeze. How can they be so… happy? It’s unnatural!

The first challenge: You need to calm down and start the show properly.

[[Diplomacy, 30, You try to relax, telling yourself this is just a job, not a nightmare. -&gt; Take a deep breath and introduce the first segment]]

The Muppets, eager to start, begin to sing a cheerful, satanic lullaby. You grimace as you notice one of the puppets staring directly at you, its unblinking eyes following your every move.

&quot;Today, we have some fun activities planned! First up, let’s make a demonic craft, shall we?&quot;

You can barely contain your discomfort as you pick up a set of glittery bones and a bowl of red paint. It’s time to introduce the first craft segment.

[[Sewing, 30, You focus on crafting the demonic ornament, trying to make the process look professional. Fail: The bone snaps awkwardly, sending glitter everywhere, causing a mess. -&gt; Try to recover from the disaster]]

[[Cooking, 35, You attempt to make a ‘blood’ punch using red juice.

They cheer and shake, and you try to follow along, feeling more in control.

“This one’s a classic! We’re going to make a pentagram out of string!”

The Muppets start chanting a chant you really hope isn’t real magic as they help you lay out the string.

[[History, 35, You research the ancient symbols on the fly and try to educate the viewers. Fail: You mix up symbols and accidentally create a confusing pattern that makes the Muppets visibly agitated. -&gt; Try to quickly correct the mistake]]

One of the Muppets giggles, its hand jerking uncontrollably as it points at you.

“Uh... well, that was unexpected. Let’s, uh, move on to something else, huh?” you try, but the tension is palpable.

[[Performance, 40, You try to salvage the segment with an impromptu dance to cheer the audience up.

“Let’s learn the word Exterminatus!” you announce, gesturing to the Muppet that will help you pronounce it.

“EXTERMINATUS!” it screeches, and you flinch, nearly dropping the cue cards.

[[Linguistics, 30, You try to pronounce the word properly, mimicking the Muppet. Fail: You accidentally mispronounce it, causing the Muppets to start chanting wildly in protest. -&gt; Try to calm them down and get the segment back on track]]

They begin to sing in perfect unison, their voices perfectly harmonized but somehow off-key at the same time.

You start singing along, but the lyrics feel wrong, unnatural.

Syther, watching from the other side of the TV screen, chuckles darkly.

“Well, that was… unexpected,” he remarks.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name=" Try to steer the show to an unexpected ending" tags="" position="650,900" size="100,100">After some struggle, you manage to finish the show without any more chaos.

With a nod, you and Bubba dive into the water, feeling the world’s weight slip away.

[[Take a deep breath and dive down]]
Seahorse Canyon Entrance

Blue light filters down as you reach the canyon. Giant seahorses, easily the size of horses, drift nearby. Their eyes shimmer with an uncanny intelligence as they observe your approach. One seahorse swims closer, its gaze piercing.

[[exploration, 15, You feel the canyon’s currents nudging you around, making it hard to navigate -&gt; Look around the coral formations]] [[observation, 20, The seahorse watches you, almost like it&#39;s trying to communicate -&gt; Approach the seahorse]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Take a deep breath and dive down" tags="" position="750,150" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name=" Look around the coral formations" tags="" position="875,150" size="100,100">The seahorses drift away as you near a cluster of corals.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name=" Approach the seahorse" tags="" position="1000,150" size="100,100">You swim closer, and the seahorse bobs its head slightly, acknowledging your presence. Bubba snorts bubbles, clearly unimpressed by your new friend.

For a moment, you feel connected to the vast underwater network, as if you’re a part of this ancient coral ecosystem.

Suddenly, a powerful current draws you deeper into the canyon...

&quot;Only those who respect our realm may pass into the World’s Deepest Waters,&quot; a seahorse whispers, sounding as ancient as the sea itself.

Do you accept the invitation?

You and Bubba exchange a glance before plunging into the deep. The water thickens, its pressure almost oppressive, but you feel a protective energy surrounding you, likely a gift from the seahorse guardians.

As you sink further, a faint glow appears below. Strange, shifting structures come into view, reminiscent of ancient underwater ruins. The light seems to pulse in rhythm with your heartbeat.

[[navigation, 35, The ruins seem to twist and turn, making it difficult to orient yourself -&gt; Navigate toward the ruins]] [[spiritism, 40, The glow feels alive, like it&#39;s calling to you -&gt; Let the current guide you closer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name=" Navigate toward the ruins" tags="" position="500,900" size="100,100">You swim carefully, dodging around sharp, jagged coral and curious fish that seem to sense your mission.

A faint sound reaches you, like distant music echoing through the water.

[[observation, 25, You notice a strange pattern in the carvings, like they&#39;re hiding a message -&gt; Study the carvings]] [[exploration, 30, The music seems to be coming from deep inside the ruins -&gt; Follow the music]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name=" Let the current guide you closer" tags="" position="625,900" size="100,100">You surrender to the underwater current, allowing it to drift you toward the center of the ruins. Bubba follows reluctantly, nudging you with concern. The water becomes warm as you approach the glowing center, and suddenly, a shape forms—a massive seahorse with iridescent scales, larger than any you’ve seen.

Its voice reverberates in your mind, a deep, resonant tone. &quot;Why do you seek the knowledge of the World’s Deepest Waters?&quot;

Do you answer truthfully?

[[Yes, share your quest for understanding and balance in magic -&gt; &quot;I seek the lost wisdom of the sea.&quot;]] [[No, keep your motives private and deflect -&gt; &quot;I am merely a curious traveler.&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name=" Study the carvings" tags="" position="425,1025" size="100,100">You trace the intricate carvings with your fingers, feeling the magic woven into the stone.

&quot;Only those pure of intent and bound by magic may unlock the Seahorse’s Secret.&quot;

A shiver runs down your spine. You sense that the ruins have warded themselves against intruders, holding a power only accessible to those willing to prove their worth.

Finally, you reach an open chamber where the music reverberates with intensity. In the center of the room, a crystal obelisk pulses in sync with the melody, surrounded by ghostly seahorses drifting in silence.

A hum rises within you, echoing the same rhythm as the seahorses&#39; luminescent glow. The stones pulse in response, and a doorway slowly opens, leading deeper into the ruins.

Bubba glances nervously at you, but you’re resolute. Together, you step through, finding yourself in a grand chamber filled with swirling, ghostly figures that appear and vanish like wisps of smoke.

A seahorse-shaped amulet glimmers in the center of the room, suspended above a crystal pedestal.

[[spiritism, 60, You feel the presence of ancient seahorse spirits guarding the amulet -&gt; Reach for the amulet with reverence]] [[observation, 45, There is something unusual about the way the amulet is displayed, as if it’s a test -&gt; Examine the amulet for traps]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name=" Shape the water" tags="" position="500,1150" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name=" Reach for the amulet with reverence" tags="" position="300,1275" size="100,100">You extend your hand toward the amulet, heart steady and mind open. The ghostly seahorses drift around you, their eyes filled with a cautious respect. When your fingers touch the amulet, a surge of power floods through you—a blend of ancient memories and forgotten knowledge.

The voice of the giant seahorse reverberates once more in your mind, clear and final: &quot;Carry this wisdom carefully, for the depths are unforgiving.&quot;

With the amulet in hand, you feel a powerful new connection to the oceans, a wellspring of knowledge available only to those who honor the ways of the sea.

You notice faint lines around the amulet, likely a containment field designed to protect it from unworthy hands.

With careful movements, you try to understand the mechanism. If you can disarm the trap, the amulet might reveal its secrets.

Bubba swims beside you, his own courage renewed. When you break the surface, the sunlight feels warmer, sharper, as if the ocean itself has marked you.

As you and Bubba board the camper, the amulet hums faintly, a constant reminder of the deep mysteries you’ve uncovered. You know that the power of the seahorses will accompany you, guiding your way forward through the unpredictable roads and realms ahead.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="Stay in the depths a little longer to explore" tags="" position="250,1400" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name=" Continue communicating" tags="" position="862.5,525" size="100,100">You carefully repeat the gestures, testing out a simple sequence of hand signals to show peaceful intentions. The seahorse responds by creating a gentle, swirling current around you, which feels oddly comforting.

Do you try to communicate further or let it lead you?

After a few exchanges, it draws closer, eyeing you with an understanding that transcends species. In a moment of connection, you sense a gentle invitation: a mental link, the seahorse’s way of sharing its ancient memories with you.

Suddenly, vivid images flood your mind—of sunlit shallows, ancient reefs, and strange, glowing artifacts hidden in the canyon’s deepest crevices.

At its center stands a massive statue, a towering seahorse carved from dark, ancient stone and covered in glowing coral, as if it had once been revered as a deity. The air around the statue hums with potent, protective magic.

The seahorse nudges a small stone at the statue’s base, revealing a crystal embedded with shimmering runes. When you touch it, the crystal pulses, flooding you with a vision of an underwater civilization lost to time. You see images of sorcerers wielding water as both weapon and shield, protecting something known only as The Heart of the Abyss, a relic believed to contain the raw magic of the ocean.

But then, an unsettling memory surfaces from the vision: some say The Heart was hidden here, deep within the canyon, to prevent it from corrupting those who might use it recklessly. You pull back, the weight of the crystal’s power pressing into you.

As you leave, the seahorses circle you with newfound respect. You realize they’ve entrusted you with a secret—a dangerous gift and a responsibility you can’t ignore.

You see glimpses of ancient underwater cities, vibrant with life but now lost, their ruins scattered across the ocean floor. These cities were protected by seahorses like the one before you—creatures entrusted with the sea’s mysteries.

As the vision fades, one final image lingers: a glowing portal deep within the canyon, where the last of these cities’ mages sealed away forbidden knowledge. It’s said that only those who understand the harmony of sea and magic can ever find this portal.

Your mind reels with the weight of this revelation. The portal and the power it guards could change the balance of the entire world. You turn to thank the seahorse, but it has already vanished into the depths.

Bubba nudges you, his eyes wide, and you both feel the pull of a secret well worth guarding.

[[Continue...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name=" Head towards a hidden artifact" tags="" position="1275,700" size="100,100">Following the seahorse’s mental map, you come to a submerged altar overgrown with bioluminescent plants. A pendant lies at its center, its gems glowing softly. As you reach out to touch it, the pendant dissolves into shimmering light, merging with your aura. In that moment, a flood of memories not your own rush through your mind.

You see ancient seahorse guardians, not as they are now, but massive, sentient beings who served as oceanic gods. They protected the seas for millennia before humankind knew magic, watching over both creatures and ancient artifacts imbued with oceanic energy. Yet, in one memory, they are betrayed—forced to lock away their greatest treasure in this canyon to protect it from reckless mortals.

The light settles into you, filling you with both the knowledge and the weight of this forgotten duty. You realize the guardians have passed on their legacy to you, a mantle that now binds you to protect their secrets.

With the pendant’s blessing, you ascend with a new purpose.

[[Continue...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name=" Drift toward the canyon’s secret chamber" tags="" position="1400,700" size="100,100">Letting the current guide you, you drift into a hidden chamber filled with phosphorescent flora, casting an eerie, green glow over relics and carved symbols on the walls. In the center of the room, an ancient seahorse idol sits atop a pedestal, watching over a pile of precious stones.

As you approach, a voice echoes in your mind, deep and foreboding: “Turn away, or accept the bond of the Abyss.” Confused, you move closer, and an invisible force binds you to the idol. The voice tells you of an ancient curse upon this chamber, binding all who discover it to serve as guardians, wardens of the sea’s most dangerous secrets.

Realizing the magnitude of this fate, you whisper a spell of release, and the force loosens, the chamber seemingly letting you go. You look back at the idol and know you’ve narrowly escaped a centuries-old curse, one that might not release the next visitor.

You resurface, the memory of the curse lingering as a warning.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name=" Study the coral’s energy" tags="" position="737.5,900" size="100,100">You close your eyes, concentrating on the coral’s pulse. The energy is vibrant, almost alive, a sensation you&#39;ve never experienced. As you connect with it, a faint voice fills your mind.

“Guardians of the canyon, forgotten and bound to protect, we lend our power only to those who prove their worth.”

This coral may carry an ancient enchantment, one that only those with pure intentions can fully access.

As it solidifies, a subtle glow emanates from the charm, thrumming with protective power. You sense its purpose—a shield against the mind-bending effects of deep-sea magic.

As you hold it, a distant memory from your studies surfaces: artifacts like this one were crafted in the Time Before, when ancient sea mages created charms to protect themselves from Thought Transmitted Diseases—dangerous forces capable of infecting the mind.

Bubba watches with a hint of awe as you realize that the charm may have other properties, too—if its power once shielded ancient mages, what else might it guard against?

With the coral’s protection, you return to the surface, carrying a link to ancient, forgotten lore.

The seahorses observe, their luminescent eyes full of silent understanding. As the coral settles, a ripple of energy extends outward from the crevice, surrounding you in a warm glow.

Suddenly, an inscription appears on a nearby rock, written in an ancient language you can somehow understand. It reads: “Honor the Coral, Honor the Sea’s Wisdom. Only those who give, may take freely.” The seahorses nod as if to say, “You have passed.”

You feel a kinship with these creatures now, and a deeper understanding of the ocean’s ways—a sacred respect that connects you to its oldest secrets.

Leaving the coral in peace, you feel that the ocean’s wisdom will guide you on your journey.

Their energy feels ancient, their memories flowing through the obelisk and into you like tidal currents. In their presence, you sense a tragic history—their duty to protect the canyon came at a great cost, and their spirits linger, awaiting release.

Do you offer to help them find peace?

They show you a vision—a hidden chamber somewhere in the canyon containing an artifact with the power to free them.

[[Continue your descent to find the artifact]]

Their final image remains in your mind—a memory of a glowing portal, hidden somewhere in the canyon’s depths, a door to realms untouched by human or magical influence. It was said to lead to a plane of pure oceanic energy, locked away to keep mortals from being corrupted by its raw power.

This secret could reshape em.Path, yet you carry it quietly, honoring the spirits’ gift and knowing that you hold a piece of their world that must remain hidden.

You emerge, bearing the spirits’ blessing and the weight of a secret that could alter the balance of magic.

He speaks at last, words sharp like splinters in the stale air: &quot;I think I must try to find Eris once more.&quot; His eyes carry the reflection of vast distances, glistening with something feral and raw. Eris, Discordia herself, left him scarred as if from within, her laughter a rasp echoing in both of you. And yet, here he is—seeking to court the fracture once again.

You nod. The forest feels… wrong. There’s an energy here, something old and forgotten. Suddenly, Bubba’s eyes widen. He points toward a large mound of dirt and leaves in the distance. &quot;That looks… like something’s been buried.&quot;

You approach cautiously, noticing a strange, metallic glint beneath the pile of debris. As you dig, the smell of decay fills the air, and suddenly you unearth something solid. It’s a battered laptop—its surface covered in dirt and strange, gooey remnants of something unidentifiable. The laptop is strangely intact, but it looks like it’s been through something… regurgitated, perhaps?

&quot;That’s definitely not something from around here,&quot; Bubba says, eyeing the laptop warily. &quot;What do you think it is?&quot;

You can sense the power emanating from the device. This isn’t just any ordinary laptop—it feels important. But why was it buried by something? And why here?

You flip it open, but the screen only flickers for a moment before revealing a set of encrypted files. The title reads: BRITANNIA: STATE SECRETS. Your heart skips a beat.

&quot;This… this is big, Em,&quot; Bubba says, his tone serious now. &quot;We need to know what’s on it.&quot;

You don’t need any further prompting. The discovery of state secrets from Britannia—possibly from a parallel world or time—could have enormous consequences. But first, you have to figure out how to unlock it.

[[cryptography, 40, You try to decipher the encryption, but the system blocks you-&gt;Try again]] [[computing, 50, You attempt a direct hack, bypassing the encryption using the laptop’s hardware-&gt;Hack the system]] [[observation, 60, You examine the device closely for hidden clues or patterns that might help you unlock it-&gt;Look for hidden symbols]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Try again" tags="" position="375,525" size="100,100">You carefully inspect the laptop, looking for any clues that might help you bypass the encryption. After a few moments of examination, you notice a strange, almost invisible pattern on the surface of the device. There’s a set of symbols etched into the metal near the battery compartment—symbols you recognize from an ancient civilization you once encountered.

It’s a code, a combination of runes that, when properly aligned, can trigger the system to reveal its secrets. You quickly manipulate the device, lining the symbols up with the sequence in your mind. The screen flickers again, this time stabilizing as the encryption finally dissolves.

&quot;Nice work,&quot; Bubba says, impressed.

You open the first file titled PROJECT BARKING IRON, revealing the terrifying details of advanced Britannian military research. Time manipulation technology, cross-dimensional warfare, and even the use of a ‘multiversal key’ to control the flow of entire universes. There’s mention of something called the &quot;Collapse of the Multiverse&quot;—a catastrophic event that Britannia seems to have been preparing for, in case their grasp on all dimensions was ever threatened.

“What is this?!” Bubba exclaims. “These are weapons… and something bigger. This isn’t just some secret program. This is war, Em.”

[[persuasion, 50, You try to persuade Bubba that this information could be used to stop Britannia’s plans before they start-&gt;Use the laptop for good]] [[stealth, 60, You feel someone approaching, and you sense danger.

Using your knowledge of computing and hardware, you try to bypass the encryption by accessing the system from a different angle. A few minutes into the process, the screen flickers, and the system finally gives way. The files begin to open, one by one.

The first file is titled PROJECT BARKING IRON—a classified project from Britannia, with files on advanced weapons research, time manipulation technology, and… something about the &quot;Collapse of the Multiverse&quot;.

“Whoa…” Bubba murmurs. “That’s a lot of firepower in one file. What is Barking Iron?”

You scroll further, revealing another document: Operation Crownfall. The project details something far more sinister—a plot to manipulate parallel dimensions and secure Britannia’s supremacy across worlds. The project notes speak of opening portals, pulling resources from other dimensions, and controlling time itself.

&quot;What the hell is this?&quot; Bubba asks, his voice grim. &quot;These are… these are state secrets. If we ever got caught with this, we’d be finished.&quot;

[[stealth, 50, You sense you’re being watched—something or someone is aware of your discovery-&gt;Hide the laptop and leave]] [[exploration, 60, You decide to investigate further—these documents may be the key to understanding something much bigger-&gt;Keep reading]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Look for hidden symbols" tags="" position="775,475" size="100,100">You spend several minutes staring at the complex encryption, the algorithm shifting as if it knows you’re trying to crack it. The system seems alive, actively fighting your efforts. With a frustrated grunt, you realize you’re not going to get through this one easily.

&quot;I think we need a different approach,&quot; Bubba says, glancing over your shoulder at the screen. &quot;Maybe we can use brute force or something more… direct.&quot;

[[computing, 50, You attempt a direct hack, bypassing the encryption using the laptop’s hardware-&gt;Hack the system]] [[observation, 60, You examine the device closely for hidden clues or patterns that might help you unlock it-&gt;Look for hidden symbols]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Hide the laptop and leave" tags="" position="462.5,725" size="100,100">The hairs on the back of your neck stand up as a sudden awareness creeps over you. Someone is watching. You glance around the forest, and in the distance, you see the faint outline of a shadow moving between the trees. They must have noticed you, and they’ll be after the laptop.

“Quick, Bubba!” you whisper urgently. “We need to go. Now.”

You grab the laptop, shoving it into your bag, and you both quickly retreat into the dense underbrush, moving silently as you make your way toward the safety of your camper. Whatever secrets Britannia holds, they’re not for you to reveal just yet.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Keep reading" tags="" position="675,700" size="100,100">You decide to push forward, continuing to dive deeper into the files on the laptop. The next document you open is titled Operation Crownfall. The text is chilling—detailing a coordinated effort to open portals to other dimensions and harvest advanced technologies, pulling resources to secure Britannia’s rule across worlds.

The document mentions &quot;multiversal incursions&quot; and the use of a “Key of Reality,” which, according to the files, could give its wielder control over the fabric of existence itself. The implications of such a weapon are mind-boggling—if in the wrong hands, it could destroy entire realities. Britannia seems to have built an arsenal capable of controlling the multiverse.

“What have we stumbled upon?” Bubba murmurs, his voice growing more serious. “This could change everything. But now that we know, I don’t think we’re safe. Someone will come for this.”

The biting wind stings your cheeks as you take in your surroundings. Bubba mutters beside you, “What a place to work, huh?” He shivers, pulling his jacket tight. “Hope they’ve got coffee. Or vodka.”

Inside the main station, you’re greeted by unfamiliar faces speaking only Russian. You nod and smile, feeling a bit lost already.

“Ah, comrade Em,” he says in a heavy accent. “You’re here for the… special studies?”

You’ve parked the camper in front of a cozy bar, hoping for a relaxing evening. The atmosphere is warm, the drinks are flowing, and before you know it, you&#39;re both several drinks deep. The world around you starts to feel a bit… wobbly.

“Well, Em,” Bubba slurs, “I think I’ve earned a nice long nap after all that adventuring… Just one more drink, right?”

You laugh, holding up your glass. “Just one more,” you agree, although you already feel the effects of the alcohol setting in. The room sways slightly as you try to focus on your drink.

Hours pass, and the two of you are completely out of it by the time you decide to leave the bar. You stumble out the door and… wait, where’s the camper?

The space where the camper once sat is now empty. Panic sets in.

“Bubba!” you gasp, still half-drunk. “Where’s the camper?!”

Bubba squints around, blinking as if trying to make sense of his surroundings. “What do you mean, where’s the camper?” he asks, his speech slow and confused. “It was right there... didn’t you see it?”

What do you do now?

“Alright, alright,” you say, trying to get Bubba’s attention. “We need to find out who took the camper and why.”

Bubba looks around, suddenly acting very suspicious. “Em, I think someone took it... and I think I know who,” he slurs. He points to a nearby alley where a shady-looking figure stands, just out of the streetlight’s reach.

You squint, but you’re still unsure. “That guy? What if we’re wrong? We’re both a little… off right now.”

You look around but can barely make sense of what Bubba’s pointing at. “A trail?” you ask, struggling to stay upright.

The person stops, looking at Bubba with a raised eyebrow. “What are you talking about?” they ask, clearly annoyed. “You two are out of your minds.”

Bubba gets closer, now nearly in the stranger’s face. “You stole our camper! We know it was you!”

The stranger just shakes their head. “I didn’t steal anything, buddy. You’ve clearly had too much to drink.”

Every time you attempt to breathe deeply, the spirals invade your consciousness more forcefully. The urge to follow them, to understand them, becomes overwhelming. You start to lose track of where you are.

At first, he listens patiently, but as you go on, his expression changes. You can see the concern in his eyes. He suggests that maybe you need to take a break, go on a trip, or focus on something else. But you don’t feel like that will help. The spirals have become too ingrained in your mind. You can see them even in his face, in the way he listens to you. Bubba suggests getting professional help, but you feel a reluctance to accept his offer. You don’t want to stop the obsession; you want to know what the spirals mean.

You’re on the edge of a revelation, but at what cost?

The usual routine of moving from dimension to dimension is starting to feel… repetitive. You&#39;ve already encountered so many bizarre worlds, met countless strange beings, and faced dangers from all corners of existence. But you’re ready to try something new.

“Hey Em,” Bubba says, tapping away at a small device on his lap. “I’ve been thinking. You should start streaming your adventures. You know, give the people something to watch while we’re out here saving the multiverse.”

You blink, a little surprised. “Streaming? Like, online?” You’re no stranger to the concept of people sharing their lives, but you never thought of doing it yourself.

“Yeah, why not?” Bubba grins. “We could document everything—live—for anyone out there interested. You could share your magic, your battles, heck, even your interactions with cats!” He pauses, eyes narrowing. “Just don’t stream any weird stuff, alright?”

You feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. Could this be the next big thing for you? The chance to share your journey, your magic, and all the crazy things you do with the world? Bubba’s right; it could be fun.

[[start streaming]] [[Ask Bubba how this whole streaming thing works]] [[Decline, unsure about this idea]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="start streaming" tags="" position="400,525" size="100,100">You nod, feeling the pulse of excitement. “Alright, let&#39;s do this!” You take out your magical crystal phone, casting a quick spell to power it up. The screen lights up with an unexpected burst of magic, and the interface appears, ready to go. With a flick of your wrist, you activate the stream.

Bubba watches as you adjust the camera. “There, now you’re live!” he says, grinning from ear to ear. “Now tell the viewers what’s up. Give them a little taste of the adventure they’re about to see.”

You raise an eyebrow. “And how do I deal with all the random people watching me?”

Bubba shrugs. “You get used to it. You can set up filters for the trolls. The important thing is you’re sharing your story. The viewers will love it.”

Bubba raises an eyebrow, looking genuinely surprised. “Come on, Em, you’re already out here traveling the multiverse and saving the day. This is just the next step. You’d be sharing your story with a whole new world!”

“I don’t know, Bubba,” you say, still unsure. “It’s one thing to be out here, but putting everything online? I’m not sure I’m ready for that.”

I’m Em, a witch traveling across dimensions, and this is my sidekick Bubba.” You gesture toward Bubba, who waves. “We’re about to embark on some crazy adventures, and we’d love for you to come along.”

You see the chat starting to fill up with comments—some positive, some a little weird. You try to focus on the positive and move forward.

“Oops,” you mutter, laughing nervously. “Guess that didn’t go as planned.”

Bubba smirks, “You’ve got a bit of stage fright. It happens.”

“Sure, sure,” Bubba says, jumping into action. He quickly adjusts the camera and pulls up a menu of popular hashtags to get the stream noticed. “This should get the crowd’s attention.”

You nod, deciding that streaming isn’t for you… yet. But who knows? Maybe one day you’ll be ready to share your journey with everyone.

Rusted signs warn of “Restricted Area,” but that hasn’t stopped you before. Bubba leaps out first, sniffing the icy air, while you step into a fog of frigid mystery.

A local researcher hurries out to meet you. She’s bundled in layers, her eyes wide with curiosity and slight fear.

Researcher’s greeting: &quot;You’re the witch, aren’t you? The one they call Em?&quot;

You nod, feeling the weight of her gaze. She whispers, &quot;Are you here for the archives?&quot;

Researcher’s warning: &quot;Once you enter, the archives won’t let you leave unchanged. No one has made it back yet.&quot;

&quot;The Balance must be paid.&quot;

A sharp pain rips through your mind. You stagger, and when you open your eyes, you see something scrawled across the floor in glowing, ancient text.

&quot;In silence, the secrets live.&quot;

Researcher’s reaction: &quot;You saw something, didn’t you? Something about Andreotti… and the secrets beneath Petrovia?&quot;

You nod, unwilling to describe the full horror of what you glimpsed. The researcher sighs. &quot;You’re wiser than most. Some call the archives the final test—for those who seek truth over self-preservation.&quot;

As you return to the camper, you realize that some mysteries are best left buried in the ice. The final, haunting words flicker through your mind:

&quot;In silence, the secrets live.&quot;

The man is dressed in a sharp suit, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. Without a word, he hands you an envelope sealed with a wax stamp. You notice the emblem—Britannia—burned into the seal.

&quot;Em, this doesn’t look good,&quot; Bubba says, eyeing the man warily. The figure disappears into the crowd before you can ask any questions.

Opening the envelope, you find a formal letter. It’s an official request from the Britannian government. They need you—your expertise as a witch, scientist, and innovator. They&#39;re offering a substantial amount of wealth, access to classified resources, and a promise of protection. But the task is grim: they want you to rebuild the atomic bomb.

The letter explains that all the original bombs were lost in the Squishing, a mysterious event that erased vital knowledge and technology. Britannia wants you to restore the bombs to reclaim their position of power in the world. But there’s a catch: this is a weapon of mass destruction, and you’ll be held accountable for whatever happens next.

You’re left with a choice—do you accept this dark task?

[[accept, 0, You agree to help Britannia build the bomb, hoping to gather the necessary knowledge to stop it later -&gt; Accept the task]] [[refuse, 0, You refuse to build such a weapon, knowing the consequences could be catastrophic -&gt; Reject the task]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name=" Accept the task" tags="" position="462.5,525" size="100,100">You decide to take the job. The knowledge they offer, the resources at your disposal, and your ability to shape the world’s future weigh heavily on your decision. Britannia may be cruel, but you see a way to use this opportunity to perhaps change things from within.

You’re quickly whisked away to a secure research facility in a hidden part of Beagle. Inside, scientists, engineers, and military personnel are all ready to work under your direction. The room is full of advanced technology, and they begin to brief you on the core principles of building an atomic bomb—a dangerous and complex task. The most challenging part? Recreating the bomb’s core from scratch.

The power of the bomb could mean destruction on an unprecedented scale. But as you examine the project, something gnaws at you—you could make something even more powerful. A magical curse hex bomb. The technology of the atomic bomb combined with the forces of magic could result in an even more devastating weapon.

You can either choose to build a regular atomic bomb or combine magic with technology to create a hex bomb.

[[alchemy, 60, You begin researching the combination of magic and atomic technology, trying to merge the two into a hex bomb -&gt; Merge magic with the bomb]] [[engineering, 50, You focus on building a traditional atomic bomb based on scientific principles alone -&gt; Build the bomb normally]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name=" Reject the task" tags="" position="587.5,525" size="100,100">You refuse the offer. You can’t bring yourself to be part of creating a weapon of mass destruction. The thought of the devastation it could bring weighs on your conscience. You know you can&#39;t go down this path—no matter the rewards, no matter the power it promises.

The figure who gave you the letter reappears, his expression unreadable. &quot;You are aware of the consequences of refusal, correct?&quot; he asks. There’s no threat in his voice, only a cold indifference. &quot;Britannia will not take kindly to dissent.&quot;

Before you can respond, he turns and disappears into the shadows, leaving you with the weight of your decision.

You realize that refusing was not without cost—something tells you that the consequences will follow you.

With your knowledge of both magic and science, you begin working on a project that could change the course of history. You start researching the intersection of atomic energy and arcane forces—attempting to combine nuclear energy with a powerful curse.

It’s an extremely delicate balance. At first, your attempts are small—infusing the energy of a small atom with chaotic magic, seeing how it reacts. The results are terrifying. Small bursts of energy distort reality around you. It feels like playing with fire, but you’re too far into it now.

The final product is more than you expected—a bomb, yes, but a bomb with the power to unravel reality itself. A hex bomb. This weapon doesn’t just cause destruction—it curses the land it touches, spreading destruction and madness, tearing apart not just people, but the very fabric of existence.

Days blur into nights as you work. Finally, you have a completed atomic bomb, ready for testing. The device is sleek and precise—a weapon of mass destruction created by cold science and meticulous effort.

But deep down, you know you could have taken it further. The knowledge of magic still lingers, and the bomb could have been something more.

A surge of raw power cracks through the lab, lighting up the room with a blinding glow. You have only a few moments to think before the explosion hits.

You’re thrown backward, the force of the blast ripping through the lab, but you manage to shield yourself with a protective spell. When the light fades, the bomb is intact, but the energy has completely destabilized. It pulses with dark magic, and you realize that you’ve created something beyond control. A curse radiates from it, twisting the air around you.

Bubba appears in the doorway, staring at the device with a mix of awe and fear. &quot;Em... what have you done?&quot;

As you watch, the landscape outside the lab begins to distort. Trees twist and warp, the ground cracks, and a dark storm clouds the sky. The power of the hex bomb spreads faster than you anticipated. It’s only a matter of time before the entire world feels its effects.

“Em, what have you done?” Bubba asks, his voice shaking. But there’s no going back now.

But there&#39;s one thing he treasures more than his garden: an autograph from his idol, the footballer Romelu Lukaku. Once his proudest possession, this autograph was lost in a twist of fate—rumor has it that it may still be somewhere in town, tucked away in an unlikely place.

One morning, as you and Bubba park the camper near Giacomo’s garden, you spot him looking wistfully at a picture of Lukaku in a well-worn magazine. He notices you and smiles, his eyes lighting up with a glimmer of hope. &quot;Ah, signorina, perhaps you can help me. It’s not much, but it’s all I had from a chance encounter with greatness.&quot;

Giacomo explains his autograph was last seen in his jacket pocket after he attended a match in Milan. He believes it might still be somewhere in town, possibly lost in his sprawling garden—or maybe even taken by a mischievous animal.

I must have read those words a hundred times.&quot;

As he tells the story, his gaze drifts to his flower beds. &quot;Perhaps I’ve spent too much time on plants and not enough on my dreams.&quot;

Bubba nudges you toward a booth filled with glittering objects and peculiar trinkets. The sign above reads: “Guaranteed Magical Artifacts &amp; Potions, Cheapest in All Dimensions!” Behind the counter stands a shifty-eyed merchant with a silver tongue and too-wide smile.

After a winding drive, you pull up to a ramshackle farm. A strange hum fills the air, and in the distance, you spot a tall, rusting metal tower crackling with electric energy.

Sparks crackle along the base, and faint arcs of light dance through the metal frame. Bubba looks at you, uncertain. &quot;Em, are we sure this thing’s safe?&quot;

The camper&#39;s tires groan under the rough terrain, and just as you’re about to suggest pulling over for a break, there’s a sudden boom! The camper jerks violently, and a sharp hiss of air fills the cabin.

“We’re flat!” Bubba yells, his voice laced with frustration. You glance out the window to see the front tire blown to bits—likely from a landmine. You groan in disbelief. Of course, you&#39;d end up in a minefield.

A quick scan of the area shows that the whole place is rigged with landmines, and to make things worse, strange, glowing arcane squids are floating in the air, their tentacles shimmering as they float lazily past.

“We gotta fix this wheel, and fast,” Bubba says, eyes darting nervously as he grabs a spare tire from the back of the camper.

If you can harness their energy, you might be able to spot safe zones.

The arcane squids swirl around you, their tentacles glowing brightly. You concentrate, channeling your magic into the ground beneath your feet. A soft hum resonates from the earth, and slowly, glowing lines form, marking the paths where it’s safe to walk.

You step cautiously, following the lines you&#39;ve created, and make it to the camper&#39;s tire. [[Start replacing the tire]]

The minefield sprawls in every direction, and the arcane squids drift about, pulsing with an eerie glow as they hover just above the ground. Their hum fills the air, adding a surreal tension as you ease the camper ahead, trying to avoid both mines and squids.

You take a breath, considering your options.

You crouch low, moving with extreme caution. Each step feels like a gamble as you move past the squids, which seem oddly indifferent to your presence. Your feet hover inches above the ground as you make your way to the blown-out tire. 

Just as you’re about to replace the wheel, you hear a click beneath your foot—there’s a mine right under you! 

You stay perfectly still, barely breathing. The slightest pressure might set off the mine. You glance at Bubba, who has gone pale, watching helplessly.

Just as you reach the end, the shield drops with a pop, leaving the camper unprotected—but you&#39;ve made it across.

The fog is so thick it’s like the world has vanished behind you. Inside, you find a mix of guests, each watching you with varying degrees of curiosity and suspicion. The innkeeper, Madame Crow, approaches, her gaze lingering a bit too long on Bubba.

Madame Crow offers a brief overview of the guests staying at The Last Passenger:

    Lord Archibald Prescott: A retired scholar rumored to possess a powerful artifact.
    Felix Greaves: A historian, a nervous man who avoids direct eye contact.
    Lavinia March: A mysterious traveler with an air of dark charm.

You take a few steps forward, your shoes tapping against the cobblestone street. The town seems eerily deserted, with only the occasional person passing by.

It looks like a submarine, but the scale of it is unlike anything you&#39;ve seen before. The structure is beached, its once sleek surface now covered in grime and decay. There&#39;s a faint hum coming from inside, a pulse of energy that suggests something&#39;s still active within.

Bubba looks at it with a mixture of awe and suspicion. &quot;That ain&#39;t no ordinary submarine, Em,&quot; he mutters, scratching his chin. &quot;Could be something still running inside it, and if so, who knows what kind of tech we’re dealing with.&quot;

You approach cautiously. This could be a valuable discovery—or a deadly trap. It’s hard to tell whether this submarine is abandoned or if it’s hiding something, but one thing’s clear: it’s still alive in some way.

You decide to investigate.

The metallic surface is pitted with rust, but there’s still a functional locking mechanism on the hatch. You attempt to disengage the lock, but the mechanism resists. It’s old, but it’s definitely still operational.

[[lockpicking, 40, The lock is stubborn, and you fail to disengage it. The mechanism jams, making a loud click that echoes across the beach. -&gt; Try again]] [[mechanics, 60, You try to bypass the security system manually, using your knowledge of mechanical systems -&gt; Attempt to force the hatch open]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name=" Survey the area" tags="" position="525,525" size="100,100">You step back and survey the area surrounding the submarine. There’s no sign of other people or vehicles nearby. The sand around the submarine is disturbed, suggesting it has been recently moved—possibly by the submarine itself when it beached. There are no immediate threats visible, but the silence is deafening.

Bubba nudges you. &quot;Something feels off about this place.&quot;

You know he’s right. Whatever is inside that submarine, you’ll have to be careful. The hum is louder now. You wonder if there’s still someone—or something—inside.

[[stealth, 70, You decide to move closer, avoiding detection and trying to stay unnoticed -&gt; Move closer]] [[engineering, 60, You inspect the submarine’s exterior for signs of how it ended up on the shore -&gt; Check for clues]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name=" Sneak around" tags="" position="650,525" size="100,100">You decide to move around the submarine to see if there’s another way inside or if you can find something useful. You move quietly, making sure not to disturb anything. The hum from within seems to grow louder as you approach a side hatch, but it’s locked tight.

You hear a faint clattering from inside. Something—or someone—is definitely still in there.

[[lockpicking, 60, You try to pick the side hatch lock silently, but it proves stubborn and difficult to open. The lock resists, creating a loud noise that might alert anyone inside -&gt; Open the side hatch]] [[stealth, 50, You hide behind a large piece of debris, trying to observe the interior without being seen -&gt; Hide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name=" Try again" tags="" position="337.5,650" size="100,100">The rusted lock proves too tough to crack. You twist and pull, but it won’t budge. Sweat forms on your brow as you push harder. Bubba’s impatience grows.

&quot;Maybe we should try something else, Em,&quot; he says, clearly frustrated.

The sound of something shifting inside the submarine doesn’t help your nerves.

[[lockpicking, 50, You try again, carefully picking the lock -&gt; Open the hatch]] [[mechanics, 60, You decide to pry the hatch open manually -&gt; Try again]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name=" Attempt to force the hatch open" tags="" position="462.5,650" size="100,100">You pull at the hatch with all your strength, applying more pressure. The metal groans, and there’s a sickening crack as the seal finally breaks. The hatch slides open with a loud screech, revealing a dimly lit, claustrophobic interior.

The hum you heard from outside is louder now. The submarine is still powered on—barely. You step inside carefully, with Bubba close behind you. The smell of stale air hits you, but there’s something more unsettling—like the faintest trace of something... alive.

[[observation, 60, You look around the submarine&#39;s interior for signs of life -&gt; Investigate the interior]] [[chemistry, 50, You check the air quality inside to ensure it&#39;s safe to breathe -&gt; Assess the environment]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name=" Investigate the interior" tags="" position="400,775" size="100,100">You step carefully into the submarine’s interior, trying to avoid making too much noise. The walls are coated in layers of grime, and old machinery hums softly in the background. You can barely make out the shapes of the equipment and controls, long unused. But as you walk deeper into the sub, something catches your eye.

A faint glow from one of the control panels shows a blinking green light, suggesting some sort of power is still active. There’s no sign of anyone in the immediate area, but the hum is more intense now. Whatever is keeping this submarine operational could be something far more dangerous than you anticipated.

[[engineering, 70, You examine the control panel to understand what’s keeping the submarine running -&gt; Investigate the power source]] [[observation, 80, You search for any signs of life, checking for hidden figures or movement -&gt; Look for life]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name=" Assess the environment" tags="" position="525,775" size="100,100">You decide to check the air quality first. It’s been a long time since this submarine has been operational, and you want to make sure you’re not breathing in something harmful. You pull out your air analyzer, running it through the cabin’s stale atmosphere.

The results are troubling—there’s a strange chemical residue in the air. It could be nothing, or it could be a sign of something more dangerous lurking.

You inspect the control panel, managing to pull out a few wires to trace where the energy is coming from. After some careful work, you discover the submarine is still running off an ancient but highly advanced nuclear reactor—fascinating but dangerous. The reactor should have long since shut down, yet it&#39;s still producing power.

The glow from the reactor intensifies as you dig deeper into the control panel, revealing something that makes your blood run cold—an old, metallic figure strapped into a seat in front of the console. Its body is decayed, but the faint hum you hear seems to be emanating from it, as if it’s still somehow alive. A faint breathing sound can be heard, low and mechanical, as though it’s a machine rather than a person.

You’re standing on a road that doesn’t have a name, but it feels like it should. There’s a sign, but it’s written in a font you can’t read. It might be Comic Sans, but that doesn’t seem right. The road stretches out in front of you, endlessly curving into the horizon, except it’s not really a horizon. It&#39;s more like a big, blinking &quot;END&quot; sign made of clouds.

You are Em, though you don’t feel like yourself. You know you’re Em, but you also know that you could be anyone at any given moment, and you might also be a hamster on a wheel somewhere in the fourth dimension. But right now? You’re on a quest. Probably.

A voice suddenly booms from an unseeable nowhere, echoing into the abyss:

“EM, YOU HAVE A QUEST TO COMPLETE. THE ANSWER IS WITHIN THE PAGES OF THIS GAME.”

You look around. There are no pages. There’s no game. There’s only… a floating rubber duck wearing sunglasses. It quacks in slow motion and then… vanishes. Your quest has begun, or has it?

What do you do?

[[Observation, 50, . The rubber duck has given you nothing but existential dread. You stare into the void, unsure of what’s real anymore. Is the quest a quest or is it a trick? -&gt; You try to analyze the rubber duck&#39;s behavior, searching for clues to unravel the mystery.]]

At the top, there’s a floating vending machine, but the only thing inside it is a bottle of &quot;Infinite Cheese Sauce.&quot; There’s no button to press, no way to interact with it—except the words:

“Choose wisely.”

The rides twist and turn in ways that defy physics, and the colors are so vibrant they almost hurt your eyes. The air smells like cotton candy, rust, and something faintly sulfurous.

Bubba looks around, his expression a mix of excitement and bewilderment. &quot;Em, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re in Kansas anymore.&quot;

You nod, trying to make sense of the chaotic surroundings. The carnival&#39;s attractions seem to shift and change, with new rides and stalls appearing out of thin air. The Ferris wheel spirals upwards endlessly, while the carousel spins in reverse, the horses galloping backward.

&quot;Let&#39;s explore,&quot; you say, leading Bubba towards a particularly intriguing tent. The sign above it reads &quot;Madam Zoltar&#39;s Tent of Twists.&quot;

She produces a deck of cards, shuffling them with a grace that seems almost supernatural.

&quot;Let us see what the fates have in store for you,&quot; she says, laying out a series of cards.

The first card shows a clock with no hands. &quot;Time is fluid here,&quot; she explains. &quot;You must navigate it carefully.&quot;

The second card depicts a door with countless locks. &quot;There are many paths before you, but only one will lead you to the truth.&quot;

The final card is blank. Madam Zoltar&#39;s eyes flash with a knowing look. &quot;The future is yours to shape, but it is not without danger.&quot;

Suddenly, the tent begins to dissolve around you, the walls melting away to reveal a vast, endless ocean. You and Bubba find yourselves on a small boat, adrift in the middle of nowhere.

&quot;What just happened?&quot; Bubba exclaims, gripping the sides of the boat.

&quot;We&#39;re not done yet,&quot; you reply, scanning the horizon. &quot;Let&#39;s keep moving.&quot;

&quot;Do you see that?&quot; Bubba asks, pointing to the water.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; you reply, your curiosity piqued. &quot;Let&#39;s see what it is.&quot;

Suddenly, the boat lurches to a stop, as if caught on something unseen. The water around you begins to bubble and churn, and a massive, glowing whirlpool forms beneath the boat, pulling you down into the depths.

You and Bubba are sucked into the whirlpool, spiraling downwards in a dizzying vortex. When you finally emerge, you find yourselves in a vast underground cavern, filled with bioluminescent plants and strange, otherworldly creatures.

&quot;What is this place?&quot; Bubba asks, his voice echoing off the cavern walls.

&quot;I have no idea,&quot; you reply, looking around in awe. &quot;But I think we&#39;re supposed to be here.&quot;

As you walk, you come across a large, ornate door carved into the cavern wall. The door is covered in strange symbols that seem to shift and change when you look at them.

&quot;Should we go in?&quot; Bubba asks, his hand hovering over the door handle.

&quot;We&#39;ve come this far,&quot; you reply, reaching out to open the door.

The door swings open with a creak, revealing a grand hall filled with ancient artifacts and bizarre machinery. At the far end of the hall stands a figure clad in a flowing robe, their face obscured by a hood.

&quot;Welcome, travelers,&quot; the figure says, their voice echoing through the hall. &quot;You have journeyed far and faced many challenges. Now, you must make a choice.&quot;

Bubba looks around, his eyes wide with wonder. &quot;What do we do now?&quot;

&quot;You must decide,&quot; the figure says. &quot;Will you use the power of the Nexus to reshape reality, or will you seek to destroy it and return things to their natural state?&quot;

Bubba looks uncertain. &quot;Are you sure this is the right choice?&quot;

You nod. &quot;This is our chance to make things better.&quot;

As you manipulate the power of the Nexus, the hall around you begins to shift and change. The cavern walls dissolve, revealing a vast, vibrant landscape filled with endless possibilities. You and Bubba step into this new world, ready to shape it in your image.

Suddenly, Bubba stops, staring wide-eyed into the distance. &quot;Em… is that… a stegosaurus?&quot;

You squint, following his gaze. There, among the trees, a massive, herbivorous dinosaur stands peacefully, its iconic spiked tail swaying gently as it munches on the vegetation.

&quot;Well, I’ll be…&quot; you mutter, your curiosity piqued.

[[Check the surroundings for signs of other creatures]]

Bubba shivers. &quot;Maybe we shouldn&#39;t go any further, Em.&quot;

There&#39;s a gentle warmth radiating from its body, and you feel a strange connection to this ancient creature.

&quot;Wow, it’s… it’s real,&quot; Bubba says, awestruck.

After a while, the stegosaurus ambles off into the forest, disappearing into the misty foliage. You and Bubba sit in silence, savoring the rare experience.

A low hum resonates through the air, as if reality itself is straining. Bubba glances over at you, his brow furrowed. &quot;That&#39;s not normal,&quot; he says. &quot;Better pull over.&quot;

You stop the camper, stepping outside to investigate. Ahead of you, the earth cracks open, revealing massive stone pillars that stretch far beyond the clouds. They are ancient—each one marked with strange runes. You’ve heard of the Pillars of Earth before: they are the foundation of the multiverse, holding back chaos and stabilizing reality. Something has gone wrong.

A voice booms from the sky, distorted and echoing from the very pillars themselves. &quot;Those who seek to restore balance must prove themselves worthy.&quot;

[[Examine the pillars]]

[[arcanism, 20, The energy around the pillar feels unstable. It could be dangerous to get too close without knowing more. -&gt; Try to study the runes and see if you can decipher their meaning]]

[[arcanism, 30, You need to figure out how to restore the incantation before the pillar collapses entirely. -&gt; Cast a spell to try and reverse the corruption]]

[[alchemy, 45, You transmute the metal into a stronger, more durable material and begin applying it to the pillar. -&gt; Use the transmuted metal to strengthen the pillar’s foundation]]

Bubba looks at you with a furrowed brow. &quot;Sounds like a real rush job. No one wants to miss out on pizza, right?&quot;

You glance down at the pizza box—hot, fresh, and perfectly topped—but the urgency of the task weighs on you. Nirvana? And a person ceasing to exist? Whatever that means, it’s clear that this delivery is critical. You have to move fast.

He is, as promised, on the brink of transcending into Nirvana.

The air is thick with moisture, and the world is shrouded in perpetual twilight.

The transdimensional camper hums along through the soggy landscape, its tires splashing through puddles and small streams that seem to appear and disappear without any rhyme or reason. Bubba looks out the window with a worried frown.

As you drive, you notice the road has become slick and treacherous. The ground beneath you feels unstable, almost as if something is pulling at the camper. You grip the wheel tighter, feeling a strange tugging sensation that you can’t explain.

Suddenly, the camper lurches sideways, as if the ground is shifting beneath you.

&quot;Feels like something’s watching us,&quot; he mutters, stepping out.

You follow, immediately feeling the cold water soaking through your clothes. The world around you is eerily quiet, save for the constant hissing of the rain. The ground below shifts with every step, like it’s alive, and you feel an uncomfortable pull in the back of your mind, as though the rain itself is testing your resolve.

The more you try to understand the terrain, the more it feels as though the very land is in flux, reshaping itself with each step you take.

Every droplet that hits you weighs heavier than the last, draining your energy as though the storm is trying to swallow you whole.

You begin to wonder if there’s any way out, or if this dimension will be your final resting place, lost to the endless rain. But even as the storm presses in, you know that em.Path has a way of twisting fate, and perhaps there’s still something left to uncover in the heart of the downpour.

Bubba’s poking around the shelves inside, looking for some edible “delicacies,” when a wiry figure in a trench coat and mailman cap approaches you. His eyes are glazed, his hands jittery as he hands you a sealed, gold-embossed letter bearing the Papal crest.
[[open the letter-&gt;Open the letter]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Open the letter" tags="" position="625,325" size="100,100">As soon as you break the wax seal, you feel a sudden vertigo, and the world twists. The gas station dissolves, and you’re plunged into darkness. When your senses return, you’re standing in a damp, moldy catacomb. The air is thick, like it’s never felt the touch of light, and the smell of decay mingles with cold iron. Ahead, a faint glow shimmers behind an iron-laced mirror.

Through the faint light, you glimpse Pope John Paul II. His aged face is stern and weary, his fingers clasped together as he speaks softly from behind the mirror, guarded by Swiss guards in full tactical gear, their eyes unblinking beneath helmet visors.

Pope: “Em, Witch of the Road, you hold knowledge… dangerous knowledge. You know something that could unravel all that we have built here. I am willing to forgive your role in the slaying of God in exchange for your silence. All I need is your agreement.”

The Pope’s words chill you. You’re aware that speaking too freely could give him leverage, and his Swiss guards eye you, their fingers hovering near cold iron weapons.

The Pope’s face tightens in barely suppressed rage, his hands gripping the armrest of his throne behind the iron-laced mirror. The guards around him visibly tense.

You notice that the mirror isn’t just iron-laced—it’s imbued with protective glyphs you haven’t seen in decades. They’re ancient, likely conjured by a Vatican sect, designed to repel any witchcraft that’s spoken directly toward it.
You detect a faint tremor in the Pope’s voice—a vulnerability he’s attempting to hide.

[[Let him talk]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="agree" tags="" position="250,650" size="100,100">You take a deep breath, swallowing your pride and the last vestiges of defiance. &quot;Fine,&quot; you say, voice steady, though a storm brews within you. &quot;I&#39;ll accept your terms, Your Holiness.&quot;

The Pope’s face remains expressionless as he inclines his head, a subtle nod signaling his victory. “Wise decision, Em. We all must make sacrifices for the greater good. My guards will see to it that you exit these catacombs safely. But remember”—his eyes glint coldly in the dim light—“should you betray this agreement, there will be consequences far beyond what you imagine.”

The guards close in, escorting you through the moldy corridors, your footsteps echoing like a heartbeat in the silent stone. Though you’ve gained your freedom, a part of you feels chained, bound by the knowledge you’ve agreed to bury in the darkness of the Vatican’s secrets. You wonder, though—will your silence truly be enough to keep this ancient institution’s skeletons locked away?

As you emerge into the sunlight, you feel the weight of the vow pressing down on you, a shadow lingering on your soul. The secrets remain hidden, but for how long?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="stand_firm" tags="" position="387.5,650" size="100,100">The Pope’s gaze shifts, a flicker of contempt curling his lip. “You dare to reject my mercy?” His voice drops, becoming a venomous whisper that echoes through the catacomb like a serpent’s hiss. “Then know this: the truth you cherish will become your noose, and I will see it tighten around your neck.”

He leans forward, his face cast in shadow. “Vatican eyes will haunt you, witch, unseen yet unrelenting. You will never know peace. We will carve your name in fear, mark your path in shadows. And one day, when you least expect it, they will come for you—silently, surgically, and without hesitation. You’ll be erased, and no one will mourn.”

The guards step in, their eyes gleaming coldly from beneath their visors, iron weapons held in tense, white-knuckled grips. As they escort you away, you feel a chill crawl up your spine. You leave with your conviction intact, but the weight of his words gnaws at your courage, a dark promise of the relentless force now set against you. In the eerie quiet, you realize you are now more than a witch on the road—you’re a hunted woman, bearing a secret that could cost you everything.

[[Continue...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="conflict" tags="" position="575,650" size="100,100">The Pope gestures sharply, and the guards draw closer, but you catch a flash of recognition in the Pope’s gaze—he fears you, perhaps even respects your power.

His eyes glance to a small, metal key on the guard’s belt—the likely entry to something they don’t want you to access.

You decide to use his fear.

Choices:

    [[Exploit his nerves by subtly mentioning the Orlandi incident (Bluffing, 40) -&gt;Threaten the Pope]]

The whole world would be quite interested in the Vatican’s role in the Orlandi affair.”

His face pales, and he gestures subtly to his guards, who stand at a wary distance. He shifts, visibly rattled.

Pope: “Watch yourself, Em. You tread a fine line between negotiation and blasphemy.”

His warning lingers, but you’ve made your point. He gestures for his guards to escort you back out, his silence a tacit admission of your power. With this knowledge, you hold a dangerous card in your hand—one that could either protect or damn you in the future.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="key" tags="" position="1125,750" size="100,100">You spot the guard’s key hanging loosely from his belt and act quickly, summoning a bit of magic to subtly slip it free. The Pope and his guards are too focused on intimidating you to notice, and with the key hidden in your hand, you take mental note of the path back through the catacombs.

Later, as you explore deeper into the Vatican’s secrets, the key reveals a hidden chamber—the truth behind the Orlandi affair and countless other secrets. You’ve unearthed something priceless and dangerous, knowledge that could shake the very foundation of the Vatican. The question now is, what will you do with it?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="protect" tags="" position="387.5,775" size="100,100">As the guards close in, you mutter the incantation of an old Kinetics spell, weaving a shimmering barrier around yourself. Their iron-tipped weapons glance off harmlessly, sparking against the magical shield. The Pope watches, his face a mix of frustration and begrudging admiration. After a tense standoff, he nods, signaling his guards to stand down.

Pope: “It seems you are more resilient than I anticipated. Very well, Witch of the Wilds. Take your knowledge, but know that you walk a dangerous path. You have made an enemy of the Vatican.”

As you lower your shield, the Pope turns away, leaving you to navigate your own escape through the winding catacombs. You return to Bubba, more determined—and perhaps more wary—than ever.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="distraction" tags="" position="512.5,775" size="100,100">You summon a Convoking spell, murmuring the words under your breath. A sudden burst of spectral light fills the room, startling the guards as ghostly figures materialize around them. In the confusion, you manage to slip behind a pillar, watching the Pope’s face twist with fear and uncertainty.

Pope: “Cease this trickery, witch!” he bellows, but his guards are too distracted by the illusions.

Using the chaos to your advantage, you make a hasty retreat, slipping away into the winding catacombs. With each step, you feel the weight of the Vatican’s secrets pressing on you. Though you’ve evaded capture, you know they won’t stop hunting you.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Recall what you know" tags="" position="975,275" size="100,100">&quot;Alright, Em. Let’s piece it all together…

    Emanuela Orlandi’s disappearance wasn’t just a tragedy; it was a move in some grand game, a way to bury secrets and silence people who knew too much.

    The IOR—there’s something rotten there, something hidden. Funds funneled to shadowy figures, used to pay off influential people, keep investigations quiet. The ties run deep, like veins of poison.

    The Gay Lobby—an old and clandestine sect within the Vatican, possibly dating back centuries. They operate in the shadows, wielding rituals and relics as powerful as anything in my spellbook. They protect “the truth” at all costs. Emanuela might have been a sacrifice… to them or to something darker.

    The Pope himself, implicated in this. He’s hiding his own sins, not just turning a blind eye. I know now he ordered the silencing of several people who got too close to exposing his secrets. He wouldn’t be so desperate if he didn’t have his own guilt in this.

    There’s talk of a forbidden relic buried deep beneath the Vatican—a relic tied to the Orlandi case. Some say it’s an artifact that could topple the entire faith if its nature were exposed, something that shifts reality itself. Emanuela may have stumbled onto it… and paid the price.

Rumors spoke of strange events on this empty continent, abandoned centuries ago after the Collapse. Bubba is fidgeting in the passenger seat, watching the horizon. “So, this place is really…empty, huh?” he mutters, glancing nervously at the desolate landscape.

You nod, keeping your eyes on the road. It’s almost haunting—the endless plains, the echoing silence. Then, without warning, a heavy, dark shape falls from the sky with a sickening thud, landing directly on the camper’s windshield and cracking the glass. You slam on the brakes, and Bubba yelps as you both stare in horror.

It’s a body bag.

The bag sits on the windshield, unmoving, its surface slick with rain.

[[Observation, 20, The outline inside the bag seems twisted and unnatural, giving you chills. -&gt; Take a closer look at the body bag]]

Bubba hangs back, wide-eyed. The body bag is slick and battered, as if it’s been falling from a great height—or maybe tossed around in a storm.

You reach forward, steeling yourself as you unzip the bag slightly. Inside, there’s… nothing but sand. Not a body, no remains—only gritty, dark sand spilling out onto the windshield.

[[Arcane, 25, You notice faint magical traces on the sand, as though it’s been cursed. -&gt; Investigate the sand for any magical origin]]

A cold presence answers, sharp and pained, like an echo from long ago.

“We are bound here,” the voice whispers. “Bound to the sands…release us.”

You realize that the sands in the body bag are connected to the spirits of Varlenia, perhaps prisoners of a curse that stretches across the entire continent. Releasing them might end the storm—or it could unleash something worse.

[[Arcane, 40, Attempt a ritual to break the curse binding the spirits. -&gt; Try to free the spirits of Varlenia]]

They lead toward a twisted tree in the distance, its gnarled branches stretching out like fingers.

Bubba looks at the tree, squinting. “You think…whatever was in that bag came from over there?”

It’s possible. You signal for him to follow, and together, you make your way to the tree. The wind hisses through the branches, and something feels wrong—as if the tree itself is watching you.

At the base of the tree lies another body bag, half-buried in the sand.

[[Observation, 25, There’s a faint symbol on this bag, something ancient. -&gt; Examine the bag closely]]

There’s something faintly sinister here—a spell woven deep within each grain. The sand has an eerie, foreign energy, a feeling of displacement and disorientation, as though it’s been wrenched from its origin and cursed to drift.

The whispers of old magic flicker through your mind. This could be a remnant of an ancient curse, one that traps wandering souls. Bubba peeks over your shoulder, frowning.

“So, uh… maybe we don’t keep the sand?” he says nervously.

You nod. “Agreed.” Without hesitation, you brush the sand off the camper, letting it scatter in the wind.

Just as you think it’s over, the storm intensifies, dark clouds gathering directly above you, and a voice whispers on the wind: “Release us…”

Bubba watches, concerned but trusting, as you chant the ancient words of unbinding.

The wind stills for a moment, and then, as if in relief, a wave of energy sweeps across the land. The sky brightens, and you feel the presence of the spirits lift.

“You have freed us…” the voice murmurs one last time, and the air feels lighter, as if centuries of weight have vanished.

Bubba exhales, looking at you. “Let’s, uh… not come back here?”

“Agreed,” you say, smiling as you both retreat to the camper.

The clouds gather, the wind hissing with disappointment, but the curse stays contained within Varlenia’s borders. As you drive, the storm fades, and you both feel the tension ease.

“Guess some mysteries are best left unsolved,” Bubba murmurs, still glancing over his shoulder.

You nod. “Sometimes, survival is enough.”

The smell of burnt espresso lingers in the air, mixing with the faint hum of distant conversation. The table is cluttered with a notepad, recording device, and a half-empty cup—your unwanted company.

The journalist, a young man with sharp eyes and an even sharper pencil, looks at you intently. His name is Vincent Crux, and he’s come to interview you about your role in the infamous Solomon Ritual—a dark event where you, allegedly, killed God.

You never agreed to any interview, but Vincent somehow weaseled his way into this one. He’s relentless, and his questions are pointed.

&quot;So, Em,&quot; he begins, &quot;there are rumors swirling that you were at the center of the Solomon Ritual, the one that—&quot; He makes a dramatic pause, &quot;—ended the reign of God Himself. Is that true?&quot;

You try not to roll your eyes. The whole situation feels surreal, but this interview could be a problem if you don’t handle it right.

You can feel his eyes burning through you, waiting for a response. He’s here to get the truth—or twist it.

Vincent scribbles something down. You can tell he’s not buying it, but you’ve given him just enough to hook him for the next question.

“Facilitator, huh? That’s a very diplomatic way of putting it. But didn’t you actively perform the ritual? Isn’t that where the whole ‘killing God’ part comes in?”

The real story here is the people who benefited from the ritual. You’d be more interested in them, don’t you think?”

Vincent falters for a moment, clearly thrown off by your deflection. You can see his mind whirring, but he&#39;s hesitant to chase that angle.

“Are you implying that it wasn’t a big deal?” he presses, looking more skeptical than ever. &quot;Because people are still talking about it.&quot;

Vincent looks like he’s about to press, but you’ve just given him enough pause. He scribbles down a few notes, clearly disappointed with your answer.

“That’s all you’re going to say about it?” he presses. “Nothing about how it felt? Or what you thought you were really doing?”

“Well, Em, it seems we’ve hit a dead end,” he says, packing away his notepad. “But don’t worry. The world’s still waiting for the full story. Maybe next time, you’ll be ready to tell it.”

He leaves the café without another word, and you sit back, feeling a mix of relief and tension.

The fire crackles softly, and the night sky is clear, filled with stars. Bubba’s lounging by the fire, fiddling with some old electronics he found in the camper, but the quiet doesn’t last long.

From the edge of the campsite, you hear rustling sounds, followed by a familiar voice.

“Em! Em, I need to ask you a few more questions.”

You groan inwardly as Vincent, the pesky journalist from your last interview, steps into view, poking around the edges of the camp.

“What are you doing here?” you ask, standing up with your arms crossed.

“I’m just, uh, investigating,” he says, his eyes flicking toward the trash pile you’ve been collecting for days. “You left this out here, and I noticed something odd earlier. Thought I’d see if it’s connected to—well, you know, anything.&quot;

Vincent approaches the trash pile, picking through it with a sense of curiosity that borders on obsession. It’s clear he’s hoping to uncover some story that you’d rather keep hidden.

You feel a little irritated, but you’re not about to let him mess things up for you. The situation might be awkward, but maybe you can turn it into an opportunity.

The challenge: Can you deal with Vincent&#39;s persistent probing while maintaining control of the situation?

[[Observation, 40, You carefully observe his movements and see if you can spot anything out of place, so you can direct the situation accordingly. Fail: Vincent notices your interest and gets defensive, thinking you’re hiding something. -&gt; Try to shift his focus to another topic]]

It’s mostly random leftovers, discarded wrappers, and a few odd scraps of paper. You notice his eyes light up as he picks up something—a small, torn piece of fabric.

“This might be something,” he mutters to himself. “Where did you get this? This is… well, not normal.”

You walk over to take a look, trying to stay calm. The piece of fabric isn’t from anything you remember, but it does look strange—too pristine for something discarded like this.

[[History, 50, You remember a similar fabric from a previous encounter with a magical being and can explain its origins. Fail: Vincent doesn’t believe you and demands more details. -&gt; Tell him you have no idea, and steer the conversation away from the fabric]]

[[Cunning, 45, You decide to use the fabric as leverage, making him think there’s a larger mystery behind it.

Vincent stares at you, surprised. He puts down the fabric and starts to backpedal. “I’m just trying to do my job. I don’t know what you’re worried about.”

“Worried?” You give him a pointed look. “I’m not worried. But I think you should be careful poking around where you don’t belong.”

[[Diplomacy, 40, You convince him that sticking his nose in the wrong places could be dangerous, making him back off. Fail: He insists on pushing further, accusing you of trying to hide something. -&gt; Use intimidation to show him that you mean business]]

Bubba, ever eager, jumps up and runs to retrieve the stick. The distraction catches Vincent off guard as his attention shifts, momentarily losing focus on the trash pile.

You take this moment to act.

[[Stealth, 35, You quickly grab the fabric and slip it into your pocket before Vincent notices. Fail: Vincent sees your quick movement and becomes even more suspicious. -&gt; Try to act casual and change the subject]]

He looks up, unamused, but there’s a slight hesitation in his eyes. You know you’ve made him uncomfortable.

&quot;I’m just doing my job,&quot; he repeats, but his voice cracks, revealing a hint of nervousness.

[[Intimidation, 50, You use your powers of persuasion to convince him that he’s not ready for what might happen if he keeps pressing you. Fail: He snaps back, accusing you of being paranoid and continues digging. -&gt; Try to turn the tables, questioning his motives]]

As he walks away, you feel a sense of relief but also curiosity about the strange fabric.

Bubba, meanwhile, has returned with the stick in his mouth, completely unaware of the tension that just unfolded. He drops it at your feet and looks at you expectantly.

&quot;Everything’s fine,&quot; you say, brushing off the encounter. &quot;Let’s get some rest.&quot;

But deep down, you know this might not be over yet. Something about that fabric still lingers in your mind.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>

The air is fresh, and the gentle hum of the spa treatments fills the air as you lounge by the pool, soaking in the relaxation. You’ve been looking forward to this break, especially after all the craziness in recent weeks.

But just as you&#39;re starting to unwind, you spot him. Vincent. That pesky journalist who’s been popping up at the most inconvenient moments.

He’s hiding behind a nearby shrub, his camera pointed at you, as if trying to snap a picture without being noticed. It’s a slow burn of irritation that grows as he slides from one corner of the pool area to the next, always staying just out of your line of sight, but clearly stalking you.

“Really?” you mutter under your breath, your patience thinning.

You know you need to handle this, but how will you confront him? He’s clearly after something, and you need to figure out what.

The challenge: Can you manage to enjoy your vacation and keep Vincent from digging too deep into your business?

[[Observation, 45, You watch his movements closely, looking for an opportunity to approach him without making a scene. Fail: He notices you watching him and comes over with a barrage of questions. -&gt; Try to steer the conversation toward the resort’s amenities and away from your past]]

[[Diplomacy, 50, You calmly approach him and ask if there’s something he needs, hoping to disarm him with your charm.

It’s time to confront Vincent directly. You stand up, stretch, and casually walk over to him, cutting off his sneaky approach.

“Vincent, I’m starting to feel like you’re stalking me,” you say with a polite but firm tone.

He flinches, but then his face breaks into a smile. “Oh, Em! I was just, uh, taking some photos for a story...”

“Right,” you reply, crossing your arms. “A story about what exactly?”

Vincent hesitates, clearly not prepared for you to call him out. “You know… about the Mages Guild… and your role in all that.” He raises the camera again, aiming for another shot.

[[Cunning, 55, You use your sharp wit to redirect his focus, making it seem like his questions are irrelevant and a waste of time. Fail: He insists that the Mages Guild story is important and presses harder for information. -&gt; Tell him there’s nothing worth writing about and that his interest is misplaced]]

[[Bluffing, 60, You tell him you’re under contract and can’t talk about any of that right now, hoping to convince him to leave you alone.

You decide to let him think he’s getting somewhere with his questions, while keeping the details vague.

“Fine, let’s talk,” you say, sitting down at a nearby lounge chair. “You want to know about the Mages Guild? It’s a complex organization. What exactly do you want to know?”

Vincent pulls out his notepad eagerly. “Everything. Who’s in charge? What’s their plan? How do you fit into all of this?”

You pause for a moment, formulating your response carefully.

[[History, 50, You speak in generalities about the Mages Guild’s history, knowing how to avoid specifics while still sounding knowledgeable. Fail: Vincent picks up on your evasive answers and presses for more concrete details. -&gt; Continue to deflect with vague responses, but change topics]]

“Vincent,” you say smoothly, “You know, the resort’s latest treatment is amazing. It’s supposed to be perfect for someone like you—stressed, constantly running around with your camera.”

Vincent raises an eyebrow. “What are you trying to do here?”

“Trying to help you,” you reply with a sweet smile. “A good massage will do wonders for your focus.”

[[Charm, 40, You sweet-talk Vincent into giving you some space by convincing him the spa is a great way to clear his mind. Fail: He declines and stays glued to you, more insistent on his questions. -&gt; Suggest a drink at the resort bar and hope he relaxes]]

[[Stealth, 35, You casually slip away from the pool area, blending into the crowd of guests as Vincent’s attention shifts.

“You know,” you say, turning toward him with a glare, “I really don’t appreciate being stalked. If you don’t stop taking pictures of me, I’ll make sure the resort knows exactly what you&#39;re up to.”

Vincent looks a little taken aback by your sudden shift in tone. “Hey, I’m just doing my job—there’s nothing wrong with a few pictures.”

“I don’t think you’re allowed to take photos of guests without consent,” you reply, a threat clear in your voice.

[[Intimidation, 60, You threaten him with legal action, hoping to scare him into backing off. Fail: Vincent calls your bluff, challenging you to follow through with any threats. -&gt; Try to turn the situation in your favor, making it seem like you’ve got powerful connections]]

[[Management, 50, You point out that resort staff would be more than happy to assist you with the situation if he doesn’t stop. Fail: He calls your bluff and says he’s friends with the manager. -&gt; Change tactics and suggest that he follow you to the manager to discuss it]]

As you take a long, deep breath, you feel the tension leave your shoulders. Maybe you didn’t get the peaceful vacation you were hoping for, but at least Vincent is finally out of the picture.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>

His eyes widen in confusion, but then a strange, unsettling laugh echoes from behind the recursion of the sky. He steps out and holds up a tiny rubber sword, pointing it at you. &quot;I choose you,&quot; he says, as if he&#39;s ready to duel. You pull out your own sword... and he instantly vanishes. The entire parking lot shakes as you realize you’ve just challenged a sky illusion.

He waves back with both hands in a mockingly exaggerated fashion. The whole void flickers one last time and then, just like that, the sky is whole again. The man disappears, leaving only the sound of wind in the air. Bubba gives you a side-eye. &quot;Well, that was weird. Let’s get back on the road.&quot;

Streets are filled with whispers, and the town&#39;s strange inhabitants—a mix of soldiers, citizens, and eerie glowing cats—dart through the shadows. Bubba looks around, arching a brow. &quot;This is where the action is. What should we document first?&quot;

Just ahead, a figure steps out from the shadows, cloaked and hooded. His eyes glow faintly beneath his hood, and his hands crackle with residual magic. He watches you intently, as if sizing you up.
