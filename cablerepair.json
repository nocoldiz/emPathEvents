      "description": "You've just received a contract to repair a submarine hypernet cable that has been severed deep underwater. The cable is crucial for a major corporation, and any delay will result in a loss of data for thousands of clients. You're descending into an underground maintenance chamber on a remote island, where the hypernet cable is supposed to be accessed. The environment is dark, the air is humid, and the humming of machines fills the space. You need to assess the damage and begin the repair work immediately.",

A few sparks are visible where the cable is damaged, but the area is too wet to safely approach without precautions. The cable is made of complex fiber-optic components, and it looks like the severance has damaged the inner conduits. You'll need to use specialized tools to repair the fibers without causing more harm. Time is critical, and you need to act quickly.",
