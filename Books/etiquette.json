They are customs because they are the best rules of conduct\r\nthat have been garnered from the experiences of succeeding generations\r\nunder common conditions.\r\n\r\nTo know them, to catch their spirit, and to follow them in an\r\nintelligent way, without slavish punctiliousness but with careful\r\nobservance, make one skillful in the art of social intercourse, and at\r\nhome in any society.\r\n\r\nEtiquette will not take the place of character, nor of an accurate\r\nknowledge of human nature and the arts of practical life. Given these,\r\nhowever, it will unlock to any man or woman doors of success and\r\nprofit and real happiness which, without it, would have remained\r\nforever closed.\r\n\r\n                                                           E.

A man who is not happy in the\r\n        company cannot find any word in his memory that will\r\n        fit the occasion. All his information is a little\r\n        impertinent. A man who is happy there finds in every\r\n        turn of the conversation equally lucky occasions for\r\n        the introduction of that which he has to say. The\r\n        favorites of society, and what it calls _whole souls_,\r\n        are able men, and of more spirit than wit, who have no\r\n        uncomfortable egoism, but who exactly fill the hour\r\n        and the company, contented and contenting, at a\r\n        marriage or a funeral, a ball or a jury, a water party\r\n        or a shooting match.\"\r\n\r\n                                                  _Emerson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ETIQUETTE OF TO-DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE REWARDS OF ETIQUETTE\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIETY is a game which all men play. \"Etiquette\" is the name given\r\nthe rules of the game. If you play it well, you win. If you play it\r\nill, you lose. The prize is a certain sort of happiness without which\r\nno human being is ever quite satisfied.\r\n\r\nBecause the demand for social happiness is thus fundamental in human\r\nnature, the game has to be played quite seriously. If played\r\nseriously, it is perforce successful, even when the outward signs of\r\ntriumph are lacking. Played seriously, it becomes a worthy part of the\r\ngreat enterprise of noble living, the science of which is called\r\n\"Ethics.\" Therefore the best etiquette is that which is based upon the\r\nfundamental principles of ethics.\r\n\r\nThe etiquette, as well as the ethics, of to-day may well be summed up\r\nin the one maxim known as the \"Golden Rule\": \"Do unto others as you\r\nwould that others should do unto you.\" Or in the philosophic statement\r\nof it, given by Kant: \"Act so that the maxim of thy conduct shall be\r\nfit to be universal law.\"\r\n\r\nA certain social sense is, therefore, the foundation upon which all\r\nconcerted action rests; and this, permeating the character and winning\r\nconformity in the life, produces a social order which is at once the\r\ncriterion of civilization and the source of its power.\r\n\r\nEvery social code presupposes the trained personality, that is, the\r\nindividual who is intelligent enough and controlled enough to conform\r\nto the rules prescribed for the good of all. It is only in the common\r\ngood that true individual good can be found. Therefore is it so\r\nessential that every man regard his brother's welfare as anxiously as\r\nhis own, and permit himself to be curbed in his extravagances, limited\r\nin the indulgence of even legitimate desires, in order that he may not\r\ndefraud another, or menace the general well-being.\r\n\r\nNot only in social life, but in business, politics, and international\r\nrelations, this principle of the common good as the ultimate goal, the\r\nsupreme authority for conduct, holds good. To it society approaches,\r\nnow by direct progress and now by seeming reaction, but ever with a\r\nhigher evaluation of justice. This is shown in the fulfillment of both\r\nsmall and large obligations.\r\n\r\nFollowing the rules of courtesy, men give to each other that deference\r\nwhich each believes is his own due, and each receives in return\r\ntwofold the deference that he sincerely gives. Men show, at home and\r\nabroad, the courtesy to women in general that they would wish shown to\r\nthose of their family, and thereby the standard of respect for woman\r\nis so lifted that even the city street at night is a safe place for a\r\nwoman to pass unaccosted, if it is necessary for her to go unattended.\r\n\r\nRigidly do we hold ourselves to the established rules of good\r\nbreeding, endeavoring to make of ourselves all that Nature will\r\npermit; and we are surprised to find that Nature's own gentlemen and\r\ngentlewomen gather about us, and rare souls look to us for\r\ncompanionship, as finding in us kindred spirits.\r\n\r\nNo field so surely bears a like harvest as the one sown with the seeds\r\nof good-will and consideration for others.\r\n\r\nEtiquette tells us how to accomplish what we desire,--to make clear\r\nthe path to the goal of high companionship with many worthy\r\nminds,--and enables us to get out of social intercourse the honey that\r\nis hidden there. Without it, as social beings, we should be as\r\nworkmen without tools, architects without material, musicians without\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, etiquette is only a tool, and should never be\r\nmistaken for the finished work itself. How you carry yourself at a\r\nreception is not a matter of so great moment, as is the fact that you\r\nwent, and there exchanged certain worth-while thoughts with certain\r\npeople. It is the people, the thoughts they gave you and you gave\r\nthem, and the practical influence on your life of those people and\r\nthose thoughts, which are of moment.\r\n\r\nJust as, from a musicale, you must carry the music away in your soul,\r\neither in definite memories or in a refreshed and more joyous frame of\r\nmind, or it is of no avail that you attended, so from social\r\nintercourse it is absolutely necessary that you carry away the\r\ninspiration of meeting others and the thoughts that they have given\r\nyou, and garner from those help and guidance in your life, or the most\r\nelaborate of toilets, the most perfect of manners, and the most\r\nceremonious of customs are of little worth.\r\n\r\nThe tool, however, becomes invaluable when the master desires to\r\ncreate. Therefore, if we wish to gain from social life the enjoyment\r\nand happiness and help which it should yield, we should become\r\nfamiliar with the practice of the best forms of etiquette, so that we\r\nshall have skill and aptitude in their application.\r\n\r\nThe rewards of etiquette are, therefore, both spiritual and material.\r\nThat fine poise of soul which restrains all selfish and unlovely\r\ntendencies, that clear insight which sees the individual as but a\r\nsingle unit in the composite of the human race, that high aspiration\r\nwhich culls only the best from the mingled elements of life,--all\r\nthese come from a true and sincere adherence to the spirit of\r\ncourteous observances, and each of these is its own reward.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, human hearts open only to gentle influences, and\r\nall that it is in the power of human beings to bestow upon one another\r\ncomes most readily and most lavishly to those who outrage no social\r\ninstinct. To be highly and sincerely honored socially means to be well\r\nloved, and that must mean to be lovable. Wealth and family position\r\nare matters of chance as far as the individual is concerned, but good\r\nbreeding is a matter of personal desire and effort. It makes for power\r\nand influence, and often literally commands the wealth and position\r\nwhich the accident of birth has refused. It is the necessary colleague\r\nof intellectual ability in winning the farthest heights of success,\r\nand makes the plains of mediocre attainment habitable and pleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPERSONALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE social world is a world of personalities. Each individual has a\r\nvalue and importance according to the sum total of his\r\ncharacteristics, physical, mental, and moral. Other and more external\r\nfacts enter into his social position, but in the circle of his friends\r\nand acquaintances, in whatever grade of society he may move, his place\r\nis determined by his personality. Personality alone is the final test\r\nof a man's worth to society.\r\n\r\nA man's worth to the business world as a doer, maker, or as any other\r\nexecutive, his worth to the state as an incorruptible official, his\r\nworth to his family as a devoted husband and father, his worth to\r\nliterature or art as a thinker or maker,--these values are imprinted\r\nupon his personality, howbeit with almost imperceptible lines.\r\n\r\nIf a man would present a pleasing personality as his claim for\r\nrecognition in society, he must not neglect his mental attitude, his\r\nappearance, his manners, or his speech. They are all true expressions\r\nof his real self, and they, together with his deeds, are all that his\r\nfellow men have by which to appraise his real worth.\r\n\r\nCharacter is the foundation of all true courtesy, for manners are but\r\nminor morals, as many a writer has shown. It is not the part of a book\r\non etiquette to tell how to keep out of prison, or to explain that one\r\nshould be honorable and should do no murder. No book or person,\r\nhowever, can inculcate etiquette without showing that the roots of all\r\ntrue courtesy lie deep in the spirit of unselfish consideration for\r\nothers. To master this spirit until it becomes one's own is the best\r\nfitting one can have for social achievement. Such consideration is the\r\ntouchstone by which all social customs are tried, to see whether they\r\nbe worthy of perpetuation or not. It is the sure test of correct\r\nconduct under all circumstances, and can be so utilized in case of\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nA veneer of virtue long passes as currency in no society. It is\r\nnecessary to have character in order to be respected. As etiquette is\r\nfounded upon certain simple virtues, it is necessary, at least, to\r\naffect the semblance of them. To be long effective they must be\r\nsincere, as a little experience shows.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor moral virtues which in social life are of major\r\nimportance are those of self-control, sincerity, and unselfishness.\r\n\r\nThere is no place for anger in social life. To give expression among a\r\ngroup of people to any strong feeling, no matter how justified it may\r\nbe, is not courteous, because you may be inadvertently treading upon\r\nthe beliefs or prejudices of some of your hearers. There are times\r\nwhen debate and the taking of sides on questions of common interest\r\nare in order, but that is not usually in the mixed society of men and\r\nwomen, who are supposedly dropping, for a time, the burdens of life\r\nfor the sake of enjoyment and recreation.\r\n\r\nSelf-control is necessary not only in the constant curbing of anger\r\nand the more violent emotions, but in pushing into the background\r\none's personal desires in order that one may do one's social duty. A\r\nbridesmaid may have assumed the obligations of that honor, and then\r\nfound that, for personal reasons, they were distasteful to her. She\r\nshould not, however, permit herself to fail in one iota of her duty.\r\nThe always-remembered disappointment of the bride, or bridegroom, if\r\neither bridesmaid or best man should fail, at a time when life should\r\nbe as full of happiness as it possibly could, should more than offset\r\nthe pain of even difficult control on the part of the chosen friend,\r\nin order to carry out his or her obligations satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nIn thousands of minor circumstances the need of absolute self-command\r\nfor the sake of social virtues is evident. The man and woman who can\r\nso control themselves, and think only of others, win warm places in\r\nthe hearts of their friends.\r\n\r\nIt is a dreary thing to be always sustaining a sham of any sort.\r\nSincerity has its pleasure as well as its virtue. One should seek to\r\nbe sincere, as perhaps no social virtue is of greater importance than\r\nthis. The possibilities of development of character and of the\r\nbetterment of social customs depend upon the exercise of this virtue.\r\nFor that reason it is well to follow carefully the acknowledged rules\r\nof etiquette, in the hope and expectation of growing into the attitude\r\nof mind which will make them a natural expression of one's self.\r\n\r\n\"The little observances of social life,\" says Dr. T. L. Nichols in his\r\nbook on \"Social Life,\" \"are more important than many people think\r\nthem. The outward signs or expressions of any sentiment not only\r\nmanifest it to others, but help to keep it active in ourselves. This\r\nis the use of all ceremony and ritualism in religion . . . and the same\r\nprinciple governs all social ceremonies and observances.\"\r\n\r\nWithout unselfishness and a fine consideration for others, the art of\r\netiquette would be impossible. True etiquette learns no maxims to\r\npractise mechanically. Rather, it learns all the maxims upon which it\r\nmay have to draw, and practises them only as the considerate heart\r\nsees an opportunity and desires to embrace it.\r\n\r\nPersonal appearance is next to character in importance. The most\r\nimportant factors in this, with the average person, are not those that\r\nNature alone is responsible for, but those that the individual himself\r\nis alone responsible for. Beauty is a pleasant thing, and not to be\r\ndespised, although beauty alone is of little worth. The social\r\nconquests of history have not been confined to the possessors of\r\nbeauty, and there have been many notable cases where decided plainness\r\nand even ugliness was the lot of one who nevertheless was a person of\r\ngreat charm.\r\n\r\nOne's figure and bearing count perhaps for most, as they give the\r\nfirst and distant impression, and are, as it were, the outlines of the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nSelf-consciousness, for any reason and to even the slightest degree,\r\nis a great barrier to social intercourse and to mental freedom. It\r\nshows as often in a person's carriage as in his words or features. It\r\nshould be broken down at all costs, and this can be done only by the\r\nperson himself. It may be done, usually with comparative ease, by\r\nbecoming and staying interested in something. Then awkwardness, and a\r\ndefiant attitude of spirit and body, will vanish. Haughtiness is\r\nusually the outward sign of a great inner self-consciousness. All of\r\nthese traits, as well as their opposites, stamp themselves upon the\r\nbearing of the body, and reveal there the clearest manifestations of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nDress is almost as essential. By this is not meant a rigid adherence\r\nto fashion,--the stamp of a weak mind,--or even good taste, but an eye\r\nto the appropriate and fitting. First of all, dress should be\r\nsubordinated to character, that is, it should be no more costly than\r\nthe wearer can afford, and no more striking than modesty and good\r\ntaste allow.\r\n\r\nGood taste in dress means plain and simple styles, but material as\r\nelegant, serviceable, and pleasing as one's purse permits. It means\r\nalso a few things well chosen and kept in good order, rather than many\r\nthings more or less untidy; that one's wardrobe will be\r\nharmonious,--not a cheap, shabby garment to-day, and an expensive,\r\nshowy one to-morrow. It means also that the wardrobe throughout, not\r\nonly the external garments, is equally well chosen and well cared for.\r\n\r\nOne should not mix one's wardrobe. A coat of one suit and the skirt of\r\nanother should not be worn together. A carriage parasol should not be\r\nused on a sunny promenade, nor an umbrella in a carriage, or open\r\nautomobile.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to wear a dress appropriate to the occasion in order\r\nto be well dressed. No matter how excellent one's costume may be, if\r\nit does not suit the time and place it is absurd and incongruous. Some\r\nof the major rules for appropriate dress are as follows:\r\n\r\nFull evening dress demands one's most elaborate gown, made of silk,\r\nsatin, velvet, lace, or crepe-de-chine, as costly as one's purse\r\npermits, with decollete effects, gained by either actual cut or the\r\nuse of lace and chiffon. One should wear delicate shoes, white or\r\nlight-colored gloves, and appropriate jewels, of which it is not good\r\ntaste to have too lavish a display.\r\n\r\nAs hostess at an afternoon reception or luncheon one may wear an\r\nelaborate gown of the richest materials, with either long sleeves and\r\nhigh neck, or elbow sleeves and slightly low neck. As guest one may\r\nwear a walking suit, with pretty blouse, white gloves, and decorative\r\nhat.\r\n\r\nThe usual dress for a formal breakfast is much the same as for a\r\nluncheon,--a pretty afternoon street costume, with a dainty blouse,\r\ngloves, and \"picture\" hat, which is not removed. In summer, a gown of\r\nlight material, such as organdie, muslin, or other soft goods, dainty\r\nand somewhat elaborate, is in good taste. Hat and gloves are\r\ninvariably worn with this gown if the affair is ceremonious.\r\n\r\nFor church wear, a quiet, rather simple street dress, which does not\r\nproclaim that either money or time has been spent upon it to any\r\nnotable extent, is by far the most appropriate. The suit should be\r\nbecoming but inconspicuous.\r\n\r\nBall costume is conventionally gay and elaborate, the lightest of\r\nmaterials being used, especially by those who intend to take part in\r\nthe dancing, and a dainty effect being sought. Any costly,\r\nrich-looking materials are used, and a wide range of fashion is\r\npermitted. The gown is cut short-sleeved and decollete, and the\r\ndancing shoes are of satin or very fine kid. Jewels are worn but\r\nsparingly by young women in their first season in society. The costume\r\nof a debutante at her first ball is usually white.\r\n\r\nAt an informal dinner, any pretty gown may be worn, with special\r\nattention to the coiffure.\r\n\r\nBlack should never be worn at a wedding. If one does not care to lay\r\nit aside for the time being, one should not attend.\r\n\r\nFor men, the proper costume for an early morning breakfast is the\r\nblack cutaway coat with gray trousers, and other details as for a\r\nformal breakfast. In summer a gray morning suit with fancy waistcoat,\r\nor white flannels or linen, with appropriate hat, shoes, and tie, is\r\npermissible.\r\n\r\nAt a formal breakfast men wear frock coats, fancy waistcoats, gray\r\ntrousers, patent-leather shoes, large ties, high hats, and gray\r\ngloves.\r\n\r\nAfternoon dress for formal functions between noon and evening\r\nconsists of a double-breasted black frock coat, or a black cutaway\r\ncoat, with either light or dark waistcoat, gray trousers,\r\npatent-leather shoes, light four-in-hand tie, and light gloves.\r\n\r\nEvening dress is the correct attire for all occasions after six\r\no'clock. It consists of a black suit,--coat cut \"swallow-tail,\" and\r\nwaistcoat cut low and in the shape of a \"U,\"--with white lawn tie,\r\npatent-leather pumps, black silk stockings, white gloves, and no\r\njewelry but shirt studs, cuff links, and an inconspicuous watch fob. A\r\nblack overcoat of some stylish cut and a silk hat or crush or opera\r\nhat is also worn.\r\n\r\nFull evening dress is a man's costume for a formal dinner. The Tuxedo\r\nor short dinner coat with a black tie is intended only for dinners\r\nwhere women are not present. Although its use on other occasions is\r\ncommon, it is not correct, and ill accords with the elaborate gown\r\nwhich is usually worn at the formal dinner.\r\n\r\nOne should always have the appearance of being \"well-groomed.\" It is a\r\nminor matter to add to habits of personal cleanliness, which every man\r\nand woman of refinement adheres to with scrupulous conscientiousness,\r\nthat attention to the little details and finishing touches of\r\ndressing, which give the impression conveyed in that graphic\r\nexpression \"well-groomed.\" The niceties of life are always matters of\r\nsmall care but great moment.\r\n\r\nThe aim to be beautiful is a legitimate one, and worthy of the\r\nattention of every lover of beauty. To make the most of one's self,\r\nboth for one's own sake and that of those about one, is a duty. Much\r\ncan be done if good taste is consulted, and one's salient good points\r\nstudied and emphasized. One can at least dress characteristically, and\r\nso bring out the ideals to which one gives adherence.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the business woman, in business hours, dresses with that\r\nsame effort after efficiency and economy of time and strength that she\r\nhas to put into her business to make it successful. She is, therefore,\r\nbesides being scrupulously neat, perfectly plainly and yet durably and\r\ncomfortably dressed. The sudden storm does not catch her unprepared,\r\nfor she cannot afford to lose even an hour's work next day because she\r\n\"caught cold.\" She permits no fussing with her garments, therefore\r\nthey have to be in perfect working order, as fussing takes time, and\r\ntime is money. Her hair is done neatly, and as becomingly as possible,\r\nbut securely for the day.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the business woman be a milliner, whose own\r\nartistic personality must be her best advertisement, she takes pains\r\nto dress artistically even though she wear less serviceable and more\r\nelaborate costumes. She should, however, give the same impression of\r\nneatness and businesslike serviceableness, with the additional\r\nartistic impression which is going to show her customer that she knows\r\nhow to bring out the telling points in her own personality, and create\r\na charming effect.\r\n\r\nThe housewife needs, in her choice of morning garments, the same\r\neffectiveness as the business woman, for she must also work with real\r\nefficiency; but, in addition, she needs to give the impression of\r\nhomelike abandon, as well as beauty and grace, which shall appear\r\nrestful.\r\n\r\nThe art of correct speech and intelligent conversation is one which\r\nevery one who wishes to hold an envied place in society should\r\npossess. There is no more attractive accomplishment. Others have only\r\na limited use and give only an occasional pleasure, while good\r\nconversation is appropriate to almost any occasion, and amuses and\r\nentertains when all other interests have palled.\r\n\r\nIf one does not undertake to cultivate the art of conversation, one\r\nshould at least be correct in speech. One should not permit slovenly\r\nexpressions, or slang, or the thousand and one faults of\r\nmispronunciation and ungrammatical construction into which people\r\nfall, to be characteristic of one's speaking. For if one has time to\r\ngo into society, one should have time and money enough to make one's\r\nself presentable mentally as well as physically, and nothing so\r\nclearly shows lack of intelligence and appreciation of the matters of\r\nthe intellect, as carelessness and neglect of the words one uses and\r\nthe thoughts one utters. No physical defect is more glaring than the\r\nmental defect revealed in every sentence of such a person.\r\n\r\nMannerisms of speech or act are glaring flaws in the personality which\r\nwould delight to charm, and successfully preclude the possibility of\r\npopularity among refined people. Many a man and woman of character\r\nhave been barred from the pleasurable enjoyment of society, even by\r\npeople of less character though of more surface refinement than\r\nthemselves, because they lacked the intelligence and the good sense to\r\nabolish certain mannerisms of act or expression, which, though they\r\nmay have had normal and logical causes, were not such as society could\r\nenjoy or approve, and would not tend to anything but harm if\r\ncharacteristic of many people.\r\n\r\nCertain rather glaring faults are quite conspicuous among all classes\r\nof women, for reasons which are hard to determine, but which must be\r\ngeneral as the faults are so prevalent. Women, as a rule, do not\r\nrespect an appointment and keep it punctually, interrupt conversation\r\nrepeatedly and ruthlessly, keep visitors waiting by needless delays,\r\nand do not seem to notice or regret the sacrifice that some courtesy\r\nto them may have caused another.\r\n\r\nThe arraignment of women for these faults is indeed serious, for\r\nsocial misdemeanors could not easily be much worse. It means that the\r\ndeep heart-feeling of courtesy is quite lacking from certain classes\r\nof women,--classes not to be marked off distinctly from any grade of\r\nwealth or learning. If the ladies of a fashionable and progressive\r\nintellectual club will not, after two or three years of repeated\r\nrequests, make it a habit, one and all, to remove their hats during a\r\ndinner and the subsequent speeches in a crowded and level-floored club\r\ndining-room, it is useless to look for any finer courtesy among the\r\n\"cultured\" than among the work-worn \"laboring\" classes.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the women least at fault in these matters are the business\r\nwomen, a fact which would seem to prove that lack of business and\r\nprofessional training was in part responsible for the general apathy\r\nand indifference toward these matters of ordinary courtesy.\r\n\r\nCourtesy, like honesty, is the best policy in all our dealings with\r\nour fellow men. Therefore, we cannot afford to neglect to exercise it.\r\n\r\nPoliteness and interest in others alike lead one to make those\r\ninquiries concerning friends and their families which show real\r\nconcern in their welfare, and which are exceedingly gratifying to\r\nall. Often this kindly trait alone gives one a reputation for charm,\r\nalthough it has its disadvantages, to be sure, in its demands upon\r\none's sympathy and patience.\r\n\r\nWe each know that we are worth while. We should, therefore, treat\r\nothers on that assumption, and thereby make them rise to their\r\npotential worth. The good that a person, who thus calls out the good\r\nwithin people, may do is limited only by his acquaintance.\r\n\r\nPersonality is, after all, one's greatest asset in life. No thought or\r\neffort should be spared in making it pleasing and inspiring,--a fit\r\nexpression of one's character and ideals, and a worthy gift to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFAMILY ETIQUETTE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE permanence of a courteous manner is the test of its sincerity. If\r\none is polite invariably everywhere but at home, one's politeness is\r\nas superficial as a disguise, and as easily penetrated by the\r\ndiscerning.\r\n\r\nUnselfish consideration for others meets its sternest discipline in\r\nthe home and in family relations, and becomes, under that discipline,\r\na reliable guide, instinctively consulted in every emergency.\r\n\r\nWithout manners at home, it is impossible to preserve the real\r\nnobility and unselfishness of character which make a man or a woman\r\nsocially desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Obligations of the Married_\r\n\r\nThe marriage relation, while based upon certain fundamental\r\nprinciples, and not to be preserved without adherence to them, has\r\nsome little etiquette of its own which adds to its happiness.\r\n\r\nThe solemnization of marriage is a sacred ceremony and should be\r\nobserved in a reverent spirit. To partake of its home intimacies for\r\nthe first time as of a sacrament, and to perpetuate that same spirit\r\non the anniversaries of the day, will do much toward making it a holy\r\nand a happy union.\r\n\r\nEvery marriage should be at least a perfect friendship; so a married\r\ncouple should observe with each other the same little courtesies that\r\nthey would observe if still only friends, being as deferential in\r\ngreeting one another in public, as careful of each other's feelings,\r\nand as observant of each other's preferences.\r\n\r\nA woman should remember to accept from her husband, as her due and\r\nwithout surprise or awkwardness, the little attentions which she\r\nexpects and receives in society. A man, also, should expect, and not\r\nbe disappointed in receiving, the graceful little appreciations and\r\ncourtesies which the woman of charm extends to the man of achievement\r\nin her social circle. The difference between the appreciations of\r\nsociety and those of the family is mainly that, in society, only the\r\nmen of mark receive them, while, in the home, every man should receive\r\nhis due; for there his efforts are known, even though they are not\r\nsignal enough for society to recognize.\r\n\r\nAs equality is the only basis upon which the authority of the home\r\ncan happily rest, so a complete union of interests is the only basis\r\nfor the successful financing of a home.\r\n\r\nWhile all the virtues of good management of her household, economy in\r\nthe expenditure of money, taste in dressing herself and her children,\r\nand promptness and charm in fulfilling her social duties are expected\r\nof a wife, and should be fulfilled to the best of her ability, there\r\nare some minor things which make for happiness which should not be\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nThe wife who shines socially should remember that her family needs the\r\ncharm of her presence more than society does, and it should be a daily\r\nhousehold quality rather than for use only on state occasions.\r\n\r\nThe wife should confide in her husband on every matter of importance.\r\nShe should not trouble him with trivial things, but, if a matter is of\r\nconcern to her, she should not fail to let him know about it, and get\r\nhis advice upon it. The cement of love is mutual confidence.\r\n\r\nIf a wife takes pains to understand her husband, to be his companion,\r\nand to do her full duty by him, by her children, and by her home, she\r\ncannot fail, under the ordinary circumstances of the American home, of\r\nwinning happiness and making her husband happy. It is in the lack of\r\ndesire to understand and love that the real menace to the happiness of\r\nthe home lies. The deep-hearted and thoughtful people approach\r\nnearest the ideal of love.\r\n\r\nIt is taken for granted that the husband will perform the major duties\r\nof his relation, such as being a good citizen, a good business man,\r\nand hence a good provider for his family, and that he will in all\r\nthings seek the mutual happiness of his family and himself.\r\n\r\nHe must be considerate to his wife if he would keep her love and\r\nrespect. He should confide his business to her as far as she, in her\r\ninexperience, is able to grasp it, and he should teach her the things\r\nabout it which it is important for her to know. Through his\r\nconversation alone she can get the rudiments of a good business\r\ntraining, and she will at least be able to comprehend the changes he\r\nmay make or the difficulties in which he may find himself, and, seeing\r\ntheir cause, thus be able to sympathize, and not to blame, if reverses\r\ncome. He should so train her in business ways and methods that, in\r\ncase of his death or disability, she could attend to the business of\r\nhis estate, even though she could not, or need not, earn money for the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe work of adjusting the labors of each to those of the other, so\r\nthat there shall be time for recreation and social life together,\r\nshould be a matter of mutual effort, and should not be dropped until\r\nsolved to mutual satisfaction. If the members of the family cannot\r\nmove in the same social circle, and together, a serious breach of\r\nfamily happiness is threatened.\r\n\r\nThere is no marriage license which gives the right to constant harping\r\nupon one another's faults. In this, as in all other respects, the rule\r\nof friendship should prevail.\r\n\r\nA husband should not open his wife's letters, nor should a wife her\r\nhusband's.\r\n\r\nAll invitations are sent to a husband and wife jointly, except those\r\nfor such occasions as a stag dinner, or a luncheon or \"shower\" to\r\nwhich ladies only are invited. If for any reason either the husband or\r\nthe wife cannot attend a function, the other also must decline. The\r\nexceptions to this rule are those cases where a man or a woman of\r\nparticular talent moves in a circle the interests of which are not\r\nespecially enjoyable to the other one of the couple, or where the\r\nhealth of the one precludes the possibility of attendance upon affairs\r\nof which the other should not be deprived. Too long or too frequent\r\nuse of the excuses which cover these exceptions, reflects seriously\r\nupon the marital happiness of the pair.\r\n\r\nAlthough present together at a function, husband and wife are not\r\npaired off together in their entertainment. He takes some other woman\r\nout to dinner, and she is escorted by some other man. Even at dances\r\nand balls it is not good form for them to dance together too\r\nfrequently, except at public dances where they are two of a private\r\nparty of four or six, in which case rotation of partners would bring\r\nthem together more frequently than if a larger number of their\r\npersonal friends were present.\r\n\r\nIn America a wife never shares her husband's titles.\r\n\r\nConsultation and advice together on everything which concerns either\r\nis one of the privileges as well as the duties of marriage.\r\n\r\nTo reproach for errors which were made with good motives and the best\r\nof judgment available at the time is always unjust.\r\n\r\nAlways to greet and to part from each other with affection is the\r\nsource of much happiness.\r\n\r\nNeither parent should be overambitious. Their personalities make the\r\nhome, and if they are overworked and crowded with care, the home is\r\nnot happy.\r\n\r\nThe mother should always remember that home comes first, and should\r\nnot absent herself from it save at those times and for that length of\r\ntime when she is really not needed there.\r\n\r\nNeither husband nor wife should confide family matters to any one but\r\neach other, nor discuss each other with any other person.\r\n\r\nCompanionship means the willingness to let one's own mood be dominated\r\nby another. Therefore, if they would be companionable, a husband and\r\nwife should meet each other's moods halfway. For what is lost\r\npersonally now and then, far more of greater mutual value is obtained;\r\nand it is largely by a habit of companionableness that the happiness\r\nof the home can be made so satisfying that there can arise no question\r\nof its permanence.\r\n\r\nTo keep one's self up to one's best standard of speech and conduct is\r\nnecessary, for only thus can the family standard be kept high.\r\n\r\nAn arbitrary disposition in the home ruins the comfort of all.\r\nCompanionship and mutual authority and helpfulness are the only\r\nfoundations for a happy home.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Rules of Conduct_\r\n\r\nSeek the companionship of the refined and the gentle-mannered if you\r\nwould be the same. Move in that society in whose ways you are versed\r\nand whose rules you practice, if you would be appreciated or met with\r\nlike courtesy.\r\n\r\nNever fail to say kind words to those in distress whom you meet. The\r\nkindness, however, must be genuine, and come from the heart, never in\r\nstereotyped and hollow phrases.\r\n\r\nThe courtesy which offers attentions should be met with graciousness\r\nin receiving them. Surprise is a sign that one rates one's self lower\r\nthan did the person who showed the courtesy. Attentions should be\r\nwarmly accepted, and the gratitude expressed should be of the sort\r\nwhich does not forget.\r\n\r\nA woman, when in the presence of the men of the family, should expect\r\nthat doors will be opened for her, that she will pass through them\r\nfirst, that packages will be carried, and errands run. She should not,\r\nhowever, let these little attentions be paid her by her father or an\r\nelderly relative.\r\n\r\nEnter a room filled with people in a dignified manner and with a\r\nslight bow to the general company. \"We all do stamp our value on\r\nourselves\" is true enough, and our private stamp is never more\r\nconspicuous than when we confront a roomful of people. If we show\r\nmodesty but intense self-respect in our bearing, there is no one who\r\nwill not raise his personal estimate of us no matter what it was.\r\n\r\nThe head should be well up, the body squarely erect, the chest out.\r\nSelf-consciousness at such a time is a mistake, if natural, and shows\r\nthe actual littleness which one is trying by an upright bearing to\r\nconceal. One should train one's self until the meeting of people, no\r\nmatter who they may be, whether singly or in large numbers, is a\r\nmatter of no particular concern as to deportment.\r\n\r\nNever enter a room noisily, nor fail to close a door after you,\r\nwithout slamming.\r\n\r\nNever take another's seat unless you give it up upon his return.\r\n\r\nDignified postures in sitting are marks of respect to yourself and the\r\ncompany you are with. A gentleman does not sit astride a chair, nor\r\nwith legs spread out, nor a lady with her legs crossed. Never put out\r\nyour foot, in the street car or elsewhere, or place it where it may\r\ntrouble others in passing by.\r\n\r\nWhen several people enter a room in a private house where you are\r\nsitting, always rise, especially if they are older than you. When an\r\nelderly person enters the room alone, it is always a graceful show of\r\ndeference for all younger than he to rise and remain standing until he\r\nis seated.\r\n\r\nThe greetings of night and morning are due to all members of one's\r\nhousehold, and should not be omitted. The one who enters a room where\r\nothers are assembled gives the salutation first.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning\" is the appropriate greeting till noon. \"Good afternoon\"\r\nand \"Good evening\" are the greetings for the later hours of the day.\r\n\"Good-by\" is, however, the common and most acceptable form of\r\nfarewell. After an evening's entertainment, it is permissible also to\r\nsay \"Good night\" instead. \"Good day,\" \"Good afternoon,\" and \"Good\r\nevening,\" used in farewell, are provincial.\r\n\r\n\"I beg pardon,\" spoken with an inquiring inflection, is much better\r\nthan simply \"What?\" when you do not hear what is said. The abruptness\r\nof the latter savors of rudeness.\r\n\r\nWhispering is not permissible in company, and it is not necessary in\r\nprivate. Therefore, whisper not at all, especially not in a sick-room\r\nor in church, where the whisper is far more penetrating than a low,\r\ndistinct tone.\r\n\r\nThe calling up or down stairs is inconsiderate, for you attract the\r\nattention of two floors of people, as well as publish your message. To\r\ncarry on a conversation over the banisters is also equally bad. Even a\r\nword of inquiry should usually be spoken at short distance in a hall\r\nwhich leads to several rooms, and where many people may hear or be\r\ndisturbed by the noise. Such calling should never be permitted to\r\nservants or children, for once begun its convenience will demand its\r\ncontinuance.\r\n\r\nInterrupting another's conversation is a serious breach of courtesy.\r\n\r\nFinding fault is a very disturbing feature of home life, no matter how\r\nglaring the faults which may be criticised. Faults have to be\r\nremedied, but every effort should be made to do it skillfully, and\r\nnot make the remedy worse than the disease.\r\n\r\nDo not open your letters in company, except in case of emergency, and\r\nin the latter, ask the permission of the company to do so. Never,\r\nunder any circumstances, open a private letter addressed to another.\r\nIf the one to whom it is addressed is near enough to give you\r\npermission to open it, he can usually open it himself; if he is not by\r\nto give permission, the letter should go to his legal representative,\r\nwho then acts according to the law.\r\n\r\nPoliteness as well as pity impel one to be especially polite to the\r\ncaller or visitor who is uncongenial, or stupid, or unattractive. By\r\neven an excess of hospitality one should try to make up for the\r\ninevitable slight which society always puts upon such a one.\r\n\r\nImpartial courtesy is the right of all guests. The close friend and\r\nthe distant and far less welcome relative are entitled to equal\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\nThe holding of a grudge, and the failing to forgive a slight for which\r\napology has been made, are the height of discourtesy. It is invariably\r\ntrue that the same spirit with which you mete out social slights will\r\nbe shown you in return. Resent each one, whether intentional or a mere\r\noversight, and you will surely crush the spontaneity out of all\r\nattentions shown you, and be met only with distrust.\r\n\r\nWhen applied to for a favor, if you intend to grant it, grant it\r\ngraciously and readily; if you intend to refuse, refuse with equal\r\ncivility even though firmly. None but the unmannerly will urge a\r\nrequest when the slightest token of refusal has been given.\r\n\r\nA gentleman may offer personal service to a lady, if there is need,\r\ntying her shoe, or hooking or buttoning her dress, or doing any other\r\nlittle act which she cannot herself do.\r\n\r\nIn a company of people, it is the height of rudeness to call attention\r\nto the form or features or dress of any one present.\r\n\r\nIn using a handkerchief, always do so unobtrusively. At the dining\r\ntable it should be used very sparingly. Better retire than be\r\nobnoxious to even the most fastidious.\r\n\r\nNever look over the shoulder of any one who is reading or writing,\r\nwhether in the home, of in a car, or at a concert, or anywhere else.\r\n\r\nDo not touch any one in order to arrest his attention, but address\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTo lend a borrowed article is an appropriation of it which is next to\r\nstealing, unless one has permission of the owner to do so.\r\n\r\nSelf-control in excitement of any sort is a most valuable trait. It\r\nalways makes for comfort of one's self and of others, and often for\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nDo not pass between two persons who are talking together, if\r\navoidable. If it is not, then apologize.\r\n\r\nNever refuse to receive an apology. Courtesy requires, no matter how\r\nunforgivable the offense, that an apology should be accepted.\r\nFriendship may not be restored, but friendly courtesy should always\r\nthereafter be maintained.\r\n\r\nNever neglect to perform a commission which a friend intrusted to you.\r\nForgetfulness denotes lack of regard for the friend.\r\n\r\nNever fail to be punctual at the time appointed, in keeping every\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nTo make yourself the hero of your own story, or to speak much of your\r\nown performances, denotes deep-seated self-conceit, and may be very\r\ndistasteful to others, who also have achieved.\r\n\r\nOne's social obligations should never be neglected unless one is\r\ndetermined to drop out from one's place entirely. To acknowledge one\r\ninvitation and not another is surely to be discredited with all.\r\n\r\nNever question a child or a servant upon family matters.\r\n\r\nFulfill your promises,--or do not promise.\r\n\r\nDeaf persons should be treated with special consideration. Act as\r\nthough they could hear what is being said, yet without laying the\r\nburden of reply upon them, and without permitting it to be conspicuous\r\nin any way that they may have lost the drift of the talk. It is well\r\nto talk both louder and more expressively when they are present, but\r\nalways more distinctly, and somewhat more slowly. Never shout at\r\nthem, or attract their attention by touching them suddenly. This\r\nlatter is not polite to any one, but the stronger impulse to do it in\r\ncase of the deaf must be withstood. It is always better to come within\r\nthe range of their vision before speaking to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Table Etiquette_\r\n\r\nA man should not seat himself at the dinner table until his wife or\r\nhis hostess is seated. This rule holds good in the home, for if it is\r\nnot practised there, it will not be observed gracefully in society.\r\n\r\nSeat yourself not too close to nor too far from the table.\r\n\r\nErect position at table is the first requisite. One should so place\r\none's seat that correct position is possible, and then should keep it.\r\n\r\nElbows should never be placed upon the table.\r\n\r\nThe hands should be kept quietly in the lap while not busy with the\r\nfood. One should sit quietly at the table, without handling the\r\ncutlery or making useless motions, while waiting to be served. If\r\nthere is some form of grace said, or some simple ceremony preliminary\r\nto the meal, one should pay respectful attention silently.\r\n\r\nDo not seem impatient to be served. The meal is a social occasion and\r\nthe food is an adjunct to friendly intercourse. The success of the\r\nmeal depends equally perhaps upon the food and the conversation.\r\nBecause of the interruptions of service, conversation cannot be long\r\ncontinued, or deeply thoughtful. It must be on subjects of no great\r\nmoment nor grave interest, or on such subjects lightly touched; but it\r\nshould be on bright, cheerful topics, and as witty as the talent of\r\nthe company affords.\r\n\r\nEating should be slow, and mastication of the food thorough, for\r\nreasons of health as well as for the sake of appearance. No meal can\r\nbe eaten properly and adequately in less than thirty minutes, but more\r\nthan an hour for a meal is sheer waste of both time and food, unless\r\nthe company is large, the times of waiting between courses long, and\r\nthe portions served very small.\r\n\r\nEat silently. The noise of food being masticated is very distressing,\r\nand except in cases of crusts and crisp vegetables, perfectly\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe napkin is unfolded and spread over the lap. One is supposed to be\r\nskillful enough in raising food to the lips not to need the napkin in\r\nfront of the dress or coat to prevent injury.\r\n\r\nIn case you do not care for a course, you should not refuse it.\r\nReceive it, and take what part of it you desire, trying to take some;\r\nor, if you wish, leave it untouched, but do not have the appearance of\r\nbeing neglected or ill-provided for, even if you do not eat of it. A\r\nlittle more attention to conversation on your part may make\r\nunnoticeable to those about you the fact that you do not eat of a\r\ncertain course.\r\n\r\nIf your preference is consulted as to food, whether the matter be\r\ntrivial to you or not, express some preference so that the one who is\r\nserving, and who has asked to be guided, may be so far assisted.\r\n\r\nNever place food or waste matter upon the tablecloth. An exception to\r\nthis may be made in regard to hard breads and celery, when individual\r\ndishes for these are not furnished. Always use the side of some one of\r\nthe dishes about you for chips and scraps.\r\n\r\nThe fork is used in general except with semi-liquid sauces, where a\r\nspoon is of necessity used. It is not permissible to eat peas with a\r\nspoon.\r\n\r\nThe mouth should be closed while it contains food. It should not be\r\ntoo full, as it is often necessary to reply to some question when\r\nthere is food in the mouth.\r\n\r\nDo not leave the table until you have quite ceased chewing.\r\n\r\nBe dainty and skillful in using your napkin and cutlery, avoiding\r\nsoiling the tablecloth.\r\n\r\nDiscussions and unpleasant topics of conversation should never be\r\nintroduced. One should regard not only one's own aversions but those\r\nof the others present.\r\n\r\nNever put your finger in your mouth at table, nor pick your teeth.\r\n\r\nTidiness of personal appearance is never at a higher premium than at\r\nthe dining table. Soiled hands, negligee dress, shirt sleeves, and\r\ndisheveled hair are disgusting there.\r\n\r\nIt is quite proper to take the last helping of any dish which may be\r\npassed you. To refrain looks as if you doubted the supply.\r\n\r\nBread is not cut, but broken into fairly small pieces. One should\r\nnever nibble from a large piece.\r\n\r\nIt is permissible to eat crackers, olives, celery, radishes, salted\r\nnuts, crystallized fruits, corn on the cob, bonbons, and most raw\r\nfruits from the fingers. Apples, pears, and peaches are quartered,\r\npeeled, and then cut into small pieces. Cherries, plums, and grapes\r\nare eaten one by one, the stones being removed with the fingers and\r\nlaid upon the plate.\r\n\r\nCheese may be laid in small pieces on bread or crackers, and conveyed\r\nto the mouth in that way.\r\n\r\nAsparagus should be eaten with the fork, the part which is not readily\r\nbroken off by it being left.\r\n\r\nAt a formal meal a second helping of a dish is never offered, and\r\nshould never be asked for; but at an informal dinner party it is not\r\nout of place to accept a second helping, if one is offered, but is\r\ncomplimentary to the hostess, who is responsible for the cook.\r\n\r\nIn passing the plate for a second helping, the knife and fork should\r\nbe laid across it full length,--not held in the hand until the plate\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\nOne may ask the waiter for a second or third glass of water, as even\r\nat a formal dinner that is always permissible.\r\n\r\nLettuce, cress, and chicory are never cut with a knife, but rolled up\r\non the fork and so conveyed to the mouth.\r\n\r\nNever leave the spoon in any cup while drinking from it. Liquid\r\nbouillon,--not jellied,--should be drunk from the bouillon cup.\r\n\r\nSpoons are used for grape fruit and oranges, when cut in halves and\r\nput upon a plate, for soft-boiled eggs, puddings, custards, and\r\ngelatins.\r\n\r\nWith fruit, finger-bowls should always be passed. A bowl half-full of\r\nwater is placed upon a plate covered with a doily. Unless the fruit is\r\npassed upon a second plate, the bowl and doily are removed from this\r\nand set at one side, the fruit being eaten from this plate. The\r\nfingers are then dipped, one hand at a time, into the water, and wiped\r\nupon the napkin.\r\n\r\nSalt should never be put upon the tablecloth, but always on the side\r\nof the plate, unless the individual salts are provided.\r\n\r\nNever spit out a prune, peach, or cherry stone.\r\n\r\nNever hold food on the fork while you are talking, ready as soon as\r\nyou reach a period to be put into your mouth. Having once picked it\r\nup, eat it promptly.\r\n\r\nA bit of bread, but nothing else, may be used, if necessary, to help\r\none put food upon the fork.\r\n\r\nIf one tastes of something which one does not care to swallow, it may\r\nbe removed from the mouth with the closed left hand and placed on the\r\nplate. This should be done silently and with as little attention as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nNever take a chicken or chop bone in the fingers. Cut the meat from\r\nthe bone, leaving all that does not readily separate.\r\n\r\nBread and butter plates, with the butter spreader, are always used,\r\nexcept at formal dinners, when the dinner-roll is laid in the fold of\r\nthe napkin.\r\n\r\nThe knife is used only for cutting, and for spreading butter on bread\r\nin the absence of butter spreaders.\r\n\r\nAlmost all foods are eaten with the fork, which should always be used\r\nin the right hand with the tines up. It may be held in the left hand,\r\ntines down, when one is cutting, the knife being in the right hand.\r\n\r\nThe soup spoon is an almost circular and quite deep spoon. Therefore\r\nit is obvious that the soup should be noiselessly sipped from the\r\nside of it. When the oval dessert spoon is used for soup, it is\r\nespecially necessary to sip the liquid from the side.\r\n\r\nSpecial spoon-shaped forks are provided for salads, ices, and creams,\r\nbut for these spoons may always be substituted.\r\n\r\nNo hot drink should be poured from the cup into the saucer to cool it.\r\n\r\nToothpicks should not be passed at the table. They may be left on the\r\nsideboard, and if one is needed, it may be requested of the waiter or\r\ntaken as you leave the room, but always used in private.\r\n\r\nWherein elderly people do differently from the established ways of\r\nto-day, they are not to be criticised. Manners change even several\r\ntimes within a generation, and such may be simply following the\r\ncustoms they were taught. When the three-tined fork was the only one\r\nin common use, the blade of the knife was much more in requisition\r\nthan now.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the table the dishes of the last course should be left\r\nexactly as used, and the napkin left unfolded by the side of the\r\nplate. In case one is at home, or visiting a friend, and the napkins\r\nusually serve for two or three meals, then neatly fold it. Many\r\nfamilies have clean napkins once a day, that is, at dinner.\r\n\r\nThe chair should either be pushed quite back from the table, or close\r\nto it, so that others may easily pass by.\r\n\r\nIf obliged to leave the table in the midst of a meal, one should\r\naddress the hostess, saying, \"Please excuse me,\" as he rises.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anniversaries_\r\n\r\nThe observance of family festivals is a great bond of union when there\r\nare different ages and temperaments and interests represented in the\r\nfamily circle. In the home holidays, all meet on a common ground, and\r\nget once more into touch with each other. Yet the observance of such\r\nfestivals should never be more elaborate than the purse will justify,\r\nnor should it be allowed to become a burden upon any one, even the\r\nmost willing. The festive spirit is lost if it becomes obligatory.\r\n\r\nThe observance of wedding anniversaries is usually an honored custom\r\nin the case of happy marriages, where children grow up who take\r\ndelight in making much of the days which are sacred to their parents.\r\nWhere this observance is not a matter of form or done with any\r\nulterior motive, but is spontaneous and joyous, it adds much to the\r\nfamily happiness and strengthens the bonds, not only between parents\r\nbut between parents and children.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to make gifts of the sort signified in the name of\r\nthe anniversary, and much ingenuity can be exercised in carrying out\r\nthe idea. The anniversaries are named as follows:\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first year comes a cotton wedding; at the end of the\r\nsecond, a paper wedding; the third, a linen wedding; the fifth, a\r\nwooden; the tenth, a tin wedding; the fifteenth, a crystal; the\r\ntwentieth, linen; the twenty-fifth, silver; the thirtieth, pearl;\r\nfortieth, ruby; fiftieth, a golden wedding; and the sixtieth, a\r\ndiamond wedding.\r\n\r\nThese anniversaries may be added to, as by celebrating a leather\r\nwedding the third year, instead of two of linen; a woolen one the\r\nseventh; and a china one the twelfth.\r\n\r\nA birthday anniversary is a momentous event in the life of a child.\r\nDisregard of it is a heart-breaking slight. The celebrations of these\r\nevents, even in families where they are numerous and resources few,\r\ncan be made joyous if there is love enough to do it, even without\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Giving of Presents_\r\n\r\nThe members of a family who have each other's welfare at heart, often\r\nhave the impulse to give each other something which they may know is\r\nneeded or wanted. While this impulse should be cultivated even with\r\nthe most limited means, and the sense of generosity preserved even\r\namong the poorest,--where, to be frank, it is more apt to be found\r\nthan among the rich,--there should be no counting upon such presents,\r\nnor obligation to make them imposed. This destroys their value as\r\nexpressions of affection, and makes the custom harmful. For that\r\nreason it is not well to adhere to times and seasons, but at any time\r\nwhen the right opportunity offers and the impulse moves, give the gift\r\nthat one desires to give.\r\n\r\nWhere such an impulse is characteristic of a family, the members will\r\nnaturally take pride in expressing in that way their appreciation of\r\nindividual achievement, as when a member graduates from a high school\r\nor college, or attains his majority, or makes some special advance in\r\nany way. The spirit which welcomes achievement and recognizes it,\r\nbecomes an incentive, perhaps the strongest there is, and surely the\r\nmost noble, that of satisfying and pleasing a loved one. Life holds\r\ntoo much of defeat for the average person, for its minor victories to\r\nbe passed over in silence and indifference.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Intimate Friends_\r\n\r\nOne's attitude toward intimate friends is either a pleasant memory or\r\na sad revelation. If one holds them a little lower than one's family,\r\nand expends upon them effort to charm second only to the effort\r\nhabitually given to those whom one loves, then intimacy becomes a\r\nprivilege, no matter what the circumstances, and a lifelong\r\ngratification and pleasure. If, however, one considers that intimate\r\nfriends are entitled to less courtesy than the public, and are to be\r\nmade to serve one's purpose more effectually than mere acquaintances\r\ndo, then the burden of friendship is great, and soon dropped.\r\nAffection is not mercenary.\r\n\r\nOne word in regard to the single monopolizing friendship. Many a\r\nmarriage has been wrecked, and many a mother's friendship turned away,\r\nbecause some one friend, of about one's own age and tastes, of\r\npronounced influence and exorbitant demands, has usurped, at first\r\nperhaps unconsciously but ever surely, the place in one's life, and at\r\nlast in one's heart, that some member of the family should have taken.\r\n\r\nSome people seem naturally predisposed to this sort of friendship, and\r\nas soon as the intellectual zest is gone from absorbing companionship\r\nwith one person, they turn to another. One such instance showed\r\nthrough twenty years a series of such friendships on the part of a\r\nwell-meaning but foolish woman, in which her husband figured briefly,\r\npassing on and off the stage as violently as, and even more speedily\r\nthan, the other \"friends.\"\r\n\r\nToo great familiarity with new acquaintances is impolite as well as\r\nunwise. It cannot fail of seeming forced, and even if the friendship\r\nis to be close and permanent, a hastily-laid foundation is never the\r\nmost secure.\r\n\r\nOne should never call a friend by his Christian name until he requests\r\none to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Illness in the Home_\r\n\r\nIllness means that the order of the home life must be seriously\r\ndisturbed. Consideration for the one who is ill, and effort to\r\nalleviate the suffering, should take the place of every other thought\r\nand ambition. It is necessary, of course, that the routine of living\r\nshould be sufficiently preserved for the health of the others not to\r\nbe affected, but matters of comfort and well-being for all take\r\nprecedence of everything else.\r\n\r\nThe well should make all wise sacrifices for the sake of the ill, such\r\nas being quiet about the house; never complaining at late or simple\r\nmeals; setting aside personal plans and comfort in order to assist, if\r\nneeded, in the care of the ill; looking out for the relief and comfort\r\nof the nurse, upon whom the major part of the responsibility rests;\r\nnever grudging time or money in the effort to restore health; and,\r\nabove all, making these sacrifices in the spirit of love and not in\r\nthat of martyrdom. Many people, who make even unreasonable sacrifices\r\nfor others in times of emergency, do it so ungraciously, that one does\r\nnot feel that they are entitled to the thanks which they still\r\nactually deserve and should receive.\r\n\r\nCourtesy demands that the claims of the nurse and doctor be settled\r\npromptly and generously. They were prompt in meeting the emergency.\r\nThere should be no delay in acknowledging the obligation to them, even\r\nthough their promptness is looked upon, by them and by society, as\r\npart of their professional duty.\r\n\r\nThe convalescent takes such abnormally keen delight in being\r\nremembered, that it is obligatory upon the rest of his family and his\r\nfriends not to forget him. Kindly messages should be frequent.\r\nTrifling gifts frequently are better than large gifts occasionally,\r\nunless the large gift is something greatly desired.\r\n\r\nOne should never fail to offer the easiest and best seat in the room\r\nto an invalid, an elderly person, or a lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Courtesy to Servants_\r\n\r\nIt is safe to predict that, if the acumen of the business man, and the\r\ncourtesy of the social leader and woman of true refinement were\r\nbrought to bear upon the servant problem, that would soon assume a\r\ndifferent aspect.\r\n\r\nIf the consideration that would be shown an ailing guest were shown an\r\nailing servant, service would be more generously and more faithfully\r\nrendered.\r\n\r\nThe waitress at the table is entitled to courtesy, but not to\r\napologetic efforts to diminish her task. Appreciation may be shown in\r\na \"Thank you,\" or, \"If you please,\" but such notice of her should be\r\nunobtrusively spoken, so as not to interfere with the general\r\nconversation about the table.\r\n\r\nThe servant has every human right to civility, and the withholding of\r\nwages is no more culpable, if more illegal, than is the withholding of\r\ncivil treatment, and the infliction of the indignity of impatience and\r\nharsh and unmerited reproof.\r\n\r\nAll servants need careful training.\r\n\r\nNeatness is the first requisite. The lack of it most seriously\r\nreflects upon the management of the household.\r\n\r\nServants should be trained to answer the door-bell promptly, reply\r\ncivilly to questions, and in all things represent their master and\r\nmistress in a dignified and courteous way. They should not admit one\r\nperson who calls socially, and deny another, unless under special and\r\nexceptional orders. They should not fail to deliver promptly all\r\nnotes, messages, and cards which may be received. Verbal messages\r\nshould be received and given with accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe direct neglect of orders is unpardonable in an intelligent servant\r\nwho has been well trained, and will not occur, even in the absence of\r\nthe mistress, if the training has been explicit and complete and the\r\nservant is honorable,--as he should be in order to retain any\r\nposition. A certain degree of initiative, too, should be cultivated in\r\na servant who is given responsibility, so that he may meet an\r\nemergency with resourcefulness, in the absence of orders or specific\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nThe servant needs to respect his master and mistress. The firm,\r\nstrong, honest, and just control is respected by servants, and is much\r\npreferred to the irresolute one, even when the latter overflows\r\nfrequently in lax kindness. Each man needs to be made to do his duty,\r\nand the power that forces him to do it should be gracious but must be\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\nTo be familiar with servants is a fatal mistake, and eventually upsets\r\nand destroys all discipline.\r\n\r\nServants should never be reproved in the presence of guests, or\r\nmembers of the family, or other servants, but should be talked with\r\nsingly, and considerately, but plainly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCONVERSATION AND CORRESPONDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Art of Conversation_\r\n\r\nCONVERSATION is a game we all play, but most of us with ill success.\r\nWe do not take pains to learn the rules, and we do not consider the\r\nhonor of winning sufficiently great. It is, however, an accomplishment\r\nthat all who will may possess, that consumes a great deal of the time\r\nof all of us, and that yields great pleasure and profit if skillfully\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe subject of conversation should be pertinent, and of interest to\r\nall, or at least the majority, of those in the group of talkers. The\r\ntreasures of experience and of knowledge should be grouped about the\r\ntopic, and every one who contributes should take care to proffer\r\nnothing that the conversation has not logically called forth. Then the\r\npleasure and the success of the time thus spent is measured only by\r\nthe wit and mental resources of the talkers.\r\n\r\nNews which has a universal interest is always a legitimate subject of\r\ndiscussion. Personal news which has only the interest of gossip or\r\nscandal is never permitted among cultured people, no more than are\r\nphysiological facts or the records of criminology. It is a safe rule\r\nto speak of things rather than of persons.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant conversationalist never monopolizes the talk, as such a\r\nmethod would prevent his most telling points or his keenest wit from\r\nhaving dramatic expression. If he tells an anecdote which holds the\r\nattention of the table or of the circle of listeners, he permits his\r\nduller neighbor to tell the next, not only that his own wit may have a\r\nfoil, but that his next anecdote may meet the sharp edge of whetted\r\nappetites.\r\n\r\nIf dining out or being entertained, do not play the host or hostess by\r\nleading the conversation, even though your talent in that direction be\r\nfar superior to theirs. You thereby do them an injustice which is\r\nexceedingly discourteous on the part of one who has accepted of\r\nhospitality.\r\n\r\nNever interrupt. It kills the expression of any thought to interrupt\r\nthe speaker, and every person, no matter how badly he may express\r\nhimself, has a right to the effort and to what he can win of the\r\nhearer's attention.\r\n\r\nTo supply a word which seems to fail the speaker is perhaps a friendly\r\nservice, if he be a foreigner, but should never be tendered to a\r\ncountryman, nor often to even the most grateful wrestler with the\r\nEnglish language. It confuses any one, and the only polite way is to\r\nwait quietly until the speaker collects himself and finds his words.\r\n\r\nDo not contend any point. Among intelligent people questions may be\r\npleasantly and earnestly debated, arguments weighed and tested, and\r\nyet the conversation be absolutely courteous, although conviction be\r\ndeep on both sides. The impossibility, among untrained people, of\r\ndebate without great emotion is what retards the progress of the\r\nintellectual life in many circles.\r\n\r\nOne should never answer questions in general company that have been\r\nput to another.\r\n\r\nOne should not note the points of discrepancy in the remarks of\r\nanother, or the points of divergence in opinion. In society the\r\nsubjects of conversation are subordinated to the human interest of the\r\ngathering, and points of harmony and agreement should be emphasized,\r\nleaving all others unnoted. One does not need to conceal his opinions,\r\nbut he should not arrogantly or dogmatically publish them. Not\r\nopinions but individuals are of greater interest at that time, and the\r\nbattle of ideas should be fought in another arena.\r\n\r\nThis is the only safe rule to follow in mixed companies, or with\r\npeople imperfectly trained socially. With highly intelligent people\r\nof congenial tastes, people who have ideas and convictions of great\r\nworth, and who are controlled enough to express them without undue or\r\nfoolish emotion, the battle of ideas is fought most effectively and\r\nmost to the benefit of society, in the drawing-room of that host and\r\nhostess whose own talents make them able to draw talent about them.\r\n\r\nHere all the rules of polite society may be observed, and yet the\r\ninner convictions, whether political, religious, or moral, of the\r\ncircle, may find welcome expression and fair hearing. The growth of\r\nideas and the progress of ideals in such a society is rapid and along\r\nthe right lines.\r\n\r\nNever try to have the last word, but always refrain from saying it.\r\n\r\nDo not enter into tete-a-tete conversation in the presence of others,\r\nor refer to any topic of conversation which is not of common interest\r\nand commonly known. Mysterious allusions or assumed understandings\r\nwith one or two members of a group are insults to the others.\r\n\r\nInquiries into private affairs should never be made, but those on the\r\nsubjects of age and income are especially obnoxious, and merit for the\r\ninquirer the cool silence which they usually obtain.\r\n\r\nThe loud-voiced, aggressive person, whose opinions are alone of vital\r\nmoment in his estimation, and who will not yield a point in an\r\nargument, is much to be dreaded in any company, and effectually brings\r\nto an end any general conversation into which he intrudes.\r\n\r\nWhen addressing people face to face, it is necessary to give them\r\ntheir social or professional titles, if the latter be such as have\r\ninfluence on social rank, no matter if such titles are not inscribed\r\non the visiting card of the person possessing them, or are purely\r\nhonorary.\r\n\r\nIt is not now customary to add \"Madam,\" or \"Sir,\" or the colloquial\r\nequivalent of the former,--\"m'am\" or \"m'm,\"--to \"Yes\" and \"No,\" even\r\nby children.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Correspondence_\r\n\r\nLetter writing is a high art, and can give great pleasure to one's\r\nfriends. It must not, however, be intemperately indulged in, either in\r\nfrequency, length of letters, or freedom of expression. A timely note\r\nis a great binder of friendship, and may give comfort and satisfaction\r\nmuch greater than a longer letter at a less important moment.\r\n\r\nThe danger of letter writing is that one is tempted to pour out one's\r\ninmost feelings with thoughtless abandon, and find later that the\r\nrelative or friend to whom the letter was addressed was unworthy of\r\nthe confidence, or, if not unworthy, was repelled by it, or\r\nindiscreet in guarding it. It is always wise for one to restrain his\r\nexpression of himself, when writing or speaking, within the bounds of\r\ndignity and a self-respecting reserve.\r\n\r\nThe classic letters of literature are usually those the fervor of\r\nexpression and self-revelation of which gave them a strong human\r\ninterest, but in the preservation and publication of which sacred\r\nconfidence was violated. The average letter of the average man or\r\nwoman is by no means a classic, or worthy of preservation. It should\r\nbe destroyed when it has fulfilled the immediate purpose for which it\r\nwas written. It may otherwise sometime be instrumental in bringing\r\nridicule, if not shame, upon the unsuspecting writer.\r\n\r\nAs letter writing is the most common form of composition, the general\r\nrules pertaining to that art should be observed in even the most\r\ninformal of letters.\r\n\r\nAll letters should be concise and definite. An involved style is a\r\ngreat waste of time and mental power, and has no advantage.\r\n\r\nA letter should be written on consecutive pages, unless it be very\r\nshort, in which case it is preferable to use the first and third,\r\nrather than only the first and second, pages. It should never be\r\nwritten so that the sheet has to be turned around and the pages read\r\nat different angles. The turning over of the pages should be all that\r\nis necessary.\r\n\r\nIf, however, social note paper is used for a short business letter to\r\na business man, open the sheet out flat, turn it so that the left side\r\nbecomes the top of the sheet, and use as you would a single large\r\nsheet of commercial paper. This enables the reader to see the whole\r\nmatter at a glance.\r\n\r\nDo not scrawl your letter over the page; but do not, on the other\r\nhand, appear to economize in paper. Make the place and date lines\r\nclear and distinct. Set off the salutation from the body of the\r\nletter, and make the form of the letter upon the page artistic and\r\nconcise. Paper is cheap, and the delight of receiving a letter well\r\nframed in even margins and written on regular, if invisible, lines is\r\na pleasure easily afforded a friend.\r\n\r\nThe letter should be begun about two inches down from the upper edge\r\nof the paper. The left-hand margin should be three-quarters of an\r\ninch, with paragraph indention an inch more. The lower margin also\r\nshould be three-quarters of an inch, and the right margin should be\r\nkept even and, for best effect, almost as wide as the left margin.\r\n\r\nDo not run on the letter without paragraphing it, but place each\r\nsubject in a paragraph by itself.\r\n\r\nA business letter should always go straight to the point.\r\n\r\nA note of apology should be direct, and say but the one thing which is\r\nits subject.\r\n\r\nA note asking a favor should do it simply and without unnecessary\r\npreamble. The sense of freedom or intimacy which permits one to ask a\r\nfavor, should be great enough to obviate the necessity of long\r\nexplanation, which seems like coaxing.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of a request requires tact, and may necessitate less\r\ndirectness than courteous explanation: but it should not be so\r\nextended as to be apologetic.\r\n\r\nA letter of thanks is difficult, but too great effusiveness is as\r\ndisgusting as too great abruptness is unsatisfactory. The elusive but\r\nhappy medium is the work of the socially well-trained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paper_\r\n\r\nThe grade of paper used is a matter of no small moment. Some people\r\naffect a fastidiousness in color and quality quite out of keeping with\r\nthe purpose to which the paper is to be put. Others affect an opposite\r\nslovenliness, which shows equal disregard of use and effectiveness.\r\n\r\nA good quality of paper is essential to elegance. Plain white or cream\r\nwhite paper, unlined, with either rough or smooth finish, is always\r\ncorrect, and is the only kind for formal social correspondence. For\r\nmore intimate letters ladies sometimes use a pale blue, delicate\r\npearl-gray, light lavender or heliotrope, or a Colonial buff. There\r\nhas lately been imported the style of an envelope with lining of\r\nanother color and paper to match, in a variety of bright tints and\r\nstriking designs. These styles, even in the daintier variations of\r\nthem, appeal only to the younger members of the \"smart set.\" Gentlemen\r\nnever use any but white stationery.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence cards are a great convenience for the very shortest of\r\nmessages, where even the small note paper is too large. They are to\r\nsocial letter writing what the postal is in business. They, like the\r\npostal, should be used only for brief messages of no special\r\nimportance, or for notifications.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of taste and of expense to have one's monogram or home\r\naddress engraved at the top of choice note paper or letter paper. This\r\nmay be in gilt, silver, or colors.\r\n\r\nThe more common forms of heading are centered an inch below the top of\r\nthe paper, but may be placed somewhat lower down, and to the right,\r\nleaving about three-quarters of an inch margin. In this case the date\r\nline follows. Engraved and embossed headings are the most elegant, and\r\nprinted ones should be used only for business purposes. There can,\r\nhowever, be no objection to a very neatly printed small heading for\r\npersonal business correspondence, if it is tastefully done in a quiet\r\ncolor. While it would not be acceptable for formal social\r\ncorrespondence, it does very well on more intimate letters and saves\r\nthe necessity of writing each time the home address. It is best to use\r\nprinted letterheads, rather than commit the blunder now so common,\r\namong those who do not habitually use engraved paper, of omitting the\r\naddress from the letter. This, in case the letter is misdirected, and\r\ntravels to the Dead-Letter Office, prevents effectually its\r\nrestoration to the writer.\r\n\r\nThe size of note paper suited to the letter to be written should be\r\nused. Do not start with a small note size, and run on over several\r\nsheets. The letter size should have been taken in the first place, as\r\nthe note is only for such messages as are essentially short.\r\n\r\nThe forms of heading which are permissible at the top of the personal\r\nletter paper are the following: a crest, monogram, or the separate\r\ninitials; the name of the home if, as an estate, it has a special\r\ntitle; the name of the city and state; or the street address, with the\r\nname of the city and state beneath.\r\n\r\nWhen in mourning, it is customary to use a note paper and envelopes\r\nsurrounded with a narrow black border. The border should not exceed\r\nthree-eighths of an inch in width, and three-sixteenths of an inch\r\nduring the period of half mourning. Sometimes only a black line with\r\nthe monogram is used.\r\n\r\nScented note paper is not in good taste, except perhaps that which has\r\na very faint odor of violets or of orris root, or, in the Southland,\r\nof orange blossoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ink_\r\n\r\nColored inks are not liked or approved of by society. A good\r\nblue-black ink is the best for all writing.\r\n\r\nPale inks, too faint to be easily seen, and too lacking in stock to\r\nlast any length of time, are useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Handwriting_\r\n\r\nIllegibility in handwriting, or a stilted and difficult hand, is a\r\ngreat waste of time and energy, mainly the would-be reader's. There is\r\nno excuse, in these days of the typewriter and of common knowledge of\r\nstenography, for an illegible letter or manuscript, and the\r\ncarelessness which writes too hurriedly to form the letters is\r\nexcusable only in the gravest emergency and between intimate friends,\r\nwhere the inconvenience caused by it will be, for personal reasons,\r\ngladly forgiven. Some handwritings which are thoroughly legible are\r\nextremely tiring to the reader, and the simpler, less ornate hand is\r\nfor every purpose preferable.\r\n\r\nThe affectation of a handwriting which enables you to put but few\r\nwords on a page, is absurd and vulgar in the extreme. Yet, on the\r\nother hand, a too delicate or minute hand is not desirable.\r\nLegibility, neatness, and clearness are the salient virtues of a\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nThe use of the typewriter is confined to business. It is still very\r\nbad form to use it for personal letters; but should elegant script and\r\nsmall, clear forms of type, such as are furnished by one or two of the\r\nmachines now on the market, be in common use, there is little doubt\r\nbut what the speed of service and the advantages of clearness would\r\nbring the typewriter into use in intimate, and perhaps at last into\r\nmore formal, social correspondence. The tendency seems to lie in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sealing, Stamping, and Directing Envelopes_\r\n\r\nNeatness is especially necessary in the folding of letters, and in\r\naddressing, stamping, and sealing the envelopes. Haste and\r\nslovenliness here take away the suggestion of compliment in the\r\ncourtesy of the note, and are as insulting as any rudeness of manner\r\ncan well be.\r\n\r\nThe fastidious and leisurely still seal their envelopes with wax,\r\nimprinting thus their monogram. The well-gummed envelope now in vogue\r\nmakes this superfluous for the ordinary informal letter. Addresses\r\nshould be written with an eye to legibility, and the stamp should be\r\naffixed to the upper right-hand corner of the envelope with care and\r\nneatness. Social invitations, although engraved and therefore\r\ncontaining no handwriting, should always be sent with letter postage.\r\n\r\nLetters should be plainly and completely addressed to insure their\r\nsafe and prompt delivery.\r\n\r\nPersons who have a large business correspondence should use for it\r\nenvelopes on which their name and post office address are printed in\r\nthe upper left-hand corner. In social correspondence these should be\r\nclearly written or engraved upon the back of the envelope.\r\n\r\nSometimes where a business firm is small or little known, it\r\nfacilitates the delivery of a business letter to place the number of\r\nthe office room in a building upon the envelope. Where, however, the\r\nfirm is so large that probably the entire mail is carried from the\r\npost office in bags, or where a post office box is doubtless made use\r\nof instead of the carriers' delivery, even the street number is\r\nsuperfluous. Letters for departments should be so marked.\r\n\r\nIf the city is one of the largest in the country, the name of the\r\nstate is not added; as, New York City, Boston, Chicago, and\r\nPhiladelphia would stand alone.\r\n\r\nOnly a business letter should have the word \"City\" in place of the\r\nname of the city, and it is better to write the name, omitting, if you\r\nchoose, the state. This is permissible only when the central post\r\noffice is used, as the postmark of any suburban station might cause\r\nconfusion, and railway post office clerks, especially, should not be\r\nexpected to guess accurately the intents of a writer.\r\n\r\nWhen street addresses like \"Broadway,\" \"Park Row,\" \"Aborn Drive,\" are\r\nwritten, it is superfluous to write \"St.\" after them.\r\n\r\nThe older form of writing an address was to end each line with a\r\ncomma. The more recent style, and one coming into quite common use, is\r\nto omit the comma, using only such punctuation as the sense of the\r\nwords within the line demands. Either way is permissible.\r\n\r\nUniformity and concise clearness are characteristics of a well-written\r\naddress. An address should be written as follows:\r\n\r\n        Mr. Frankel Banchman,\r\n         15 Westland Avenue,\r\n           Philadelphia,\r\n                Pa.\r\n\r\nIf the directions are to be included, then the following arrangement\r\nis better:\r\n\r\n                Mrs. Arthur L. Casson,\r\n                    North Maplewood,\r\n                         Chestnut County,\r\n        Care of Mr. Hiram Casson.    N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe sign of per cent is no longer used to signify \"care of.\"\r\n\r\nA clergyman is addressed \"The Reverend John L. Wrigley, D. D.,\" or,\r\nless correctly, \"Rev. John L. Wrigley, D. D.,\" which may be transposed\r\nto \"Rev. Dr. John L. Wrigley.\" The omission of the article before the\r\nword \"Reverend\" is quite common.\r\n\r\nA physician is properly addressed, \"Algernon Brigham, M. D.,\" and the\r\nsalutation is \"Dear Dr. Brigham,\" or \"Dear Doctor,\" if he is an\r\nintimate friend. A man having the title of Doctor with any other\r\nsignificance than that of Doctor of Medicine, is usually addressed\r\n\"Dr. Frederic V. Harlan.\" A very formal way, however, would be to\r\naddress such a one,--supposing each of the titles to be his,--as\r\n\"Professor Frederic V. Harlan, Ph. D.\" For the letter, the salutations\r\n\"Dear Professor Harlan\" and \"Dear Dr. Harlan\" are equally correct.\r\n\r\nA letter to the President of the United States should be addressed\r\nsimply with that title and with no further specification of name,\r\nwhether it be official or social: as, \"To the President of the United\r\nStates, Executive Mansion, Washington, D. C.\" The salutation should be\r\nsimply \"Sir.\" The conclusion should be, \"I have the honor to remain\r\nYour obedient servant.\" If a social letter it may be addressed either\r\nformally or \"To the President of the United States, (Christian name\r\nand surname), Executive Mansion,\" etc. The salutation would then be\r\n\"My dear Mr. President.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vice President should be addressed officially in the same form;\r\nthat is, \"To the Vice President, Hon. Chester A. Arthur.\" He should be\r\nsaluted, officially, \"Mr. Vice President, Sir;\" socially, \"My dear Mr.\r\nArthur.\"\r\n\r\nIn addressing the governor of a state the superscription should be,\r\n\"To His Excellency, The Governor of Massachusetts, State House,\r\nBoston.\" The salutation should be \"Sir,\" if official, but \"Dear\r\nGovernor Barnard,\" if social. The conclusion of an official letter\r\nshould read, \"I have the honor to be, Sir, Your Excellency's most\r\nobedient servant.\"\r\n\r\nThe mayor of a city is addressed, \"To His Honor, The Mayor of\r\nChicago.\" Within, he is saluted officially as \"Your Honor,\" socially\r\nas \"My dear Mayor Sewall.\"\r\n\r\nAmbassadors of any country, whatever their personal distinction, may\r\nbe given the title of \"Honorable,\" and their rank placed after the\r\nsurname. As, \"Honorable Whitelaw Reid, Ambassador to the Court of St.\r\nJames.\" They may always be addressed as \"Your Excellency.\"\r\n\r\nThe members of the Cabinet of the President of the United States are\r\nalways addressed as \"Honorable,\" and the name of their department, or\r\ntheir title added: as, \"The Honorable, The Secretary of State.\" To\r\ngive the name would be superfluous, as in the case of the President.\r\nOn formal invitations, however, when the Secretary and his wife are\r\nentertaining, the form is, \"The Secretary of State and Mrs. Hay\r\nrequest the honor,\" etc.\r\n\r\nInvitations which come to one because of his official position are not\r\nintended for personal compliments, hence are addressed to the office,\r\nnot to the man personally.\r\n\r\nAn invitation from the President of the United States is equal to a\r\ncommand, and may not be declined. Other engagements must be broken for\r\nit, and only grave calamity or illness should excuse one, the excuse\r\nbeing frankly stated instead of mere formal expressions of regret.\r\n\r\nIn ceremonious notes abbreviations should never be used.\r\n\r\nShould one address the ruler of England, the superscription would be,\r\n\"His Majesty, The King, London.\" The salutation would be, \"Sir;\" the\r\nconclusion, \"I have the honor to be, Sir, Your Majesty's most obedient\r\nservant.\"\r\n\r\n\"His Grace the Duke of Fife\" is the form of address for a Duke; \"My\r\nLord Duke\" being the salutation, and \"Your Grace's most obedient\r\nservant\" the subscription.\r\n\r\nIn writing to the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, one should\r\naddress the letter to \"His Holiness, Pope ----, Rome.\" The salutation\r\nshould be \"Your Holiness,\" but the conclusion remains the same form as\r\nfor other dignitaries. A Cardinal of the same church is addressed \"To\r\nHis Eminence (Christian name) Cardinal (surname),\" and greeted as\r\n\"Your Eminence.\" Formality should be strictly observed.\r\n\r\nAn Archbishop of the Church of England is addressed, \"The Most\r\nReverend (name) His Grace the Lord Archbishop of (name of bishopric).\"\r\nThe salutation is \"My Lord Archbishop;\" the subscription, \"I have the\r\nhonor to be, with the highest respect, Your Grace's most humble\r\nservant.\" A Bishop is addressed \"The Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of\r\n(name of diocese).\" He is saluted \"My Lord Bishop.\"\r\n\r\nIn the United States the Bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church,\r\nwho are not here Lords, are addressed, singly, as \"The Right Reverend\r\n(Christian name and surname). D. D.,\" or \"The Right Reverend Bishop\r\nof (name of diocese).\" They are saluted, singly, \"Most Reverend Sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe word \"To\" may precede a formal or ceremonious address, adding to\r\nthe formality.\r\n\r\nAn envelope containing a letter or card of introduction should never\r\nbe sealed, if presented in person by the party introduced. If,\r\nhowever, he should deliver it by messenger,--an exceptional procedure,\r\nand one not to be followed by a man except in unusual\r\ncircumstances,--the envelope may be sealed.\r\n\r\nNo letter sent through the kindness of a friend should ever be sealed.\r\nThe envelope should bear, in the lower left-hand corner, the\r\nacknowledgment of the favor in words like \"Kindness of Miss\r\nHallowell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salutation, Conclusion, and Signature of Letters_\r\n\r\nA stranger should be saluted as follows: \"Mr. Eugene Motley, My dear\r\nSir;\" \"Mrs. Alonzo Parmenter, Dear Madam;\" or \"Eugene Motley, Esq., My\r\ndear Sir.\" These are forms slightly more formal than \"My dear Mr.\r\nMotley,\" or \"My dear Mrs. Parmenter,\" which in America are strangely\r\nconsidered more formal than \"Dear Mr. Motley,\" or \"Dear Mrs.\r\nParmenter,\" although in England the reverse is true. Therefore, a mere\r\nacquaintance is addressed \"My dear Mrs. Judson,\" while a friend is\r\naddressed \"Dear Mr. Clark.\"\r\n\r\nA married woman signs her name, as \"Ethel Husted,\" and then puts her\r\nformal name, \"Mrs. Hollis Husted,\" in brackets a little to the left of\r\nand a little below the other.\r\n\r\nNever sign a title. The name only is your signature. It may be\r\nnecessary to write the title in brackets and at the left, as \"(Miss)\"\r\nor \"(Mrs.),\" but it should never be part of the signature. Such notes\r\nas demand the use of the title are put in the third person.\r\n\r\nThe date should be at the end of a social note, in the lower left-hand\r\ncorner, and should be written out, with the name of the year omitted\r\nand no figures used. The grammatical form is \"The ninth of December,\"\r\nnever \"December the ninth,\" nor \"December ninth.\"\r\n\r\nIn business letters the salutation for a firm name is \"Dear Sir,\" or\r\n\"Gentlemen.\" Where two married women go into business together, there\r\nseems to be in English no combined title to take the place of the\r\nFrench, so that is generally used, and that is \"Mesdames,\" abbreviated\r\n\"Mmes.\" before their names.\r\n\r\nThe formal conclusions of letters are: \"Respectfully yours,\" used to a\r\nsuperior; \"Sincerely yours,\" or \"Truly yours,\" used largely in\r\nbusiness, or the same forms with the adverb \"Very\" preceding them.\r\nLess formal terms are: \"Cordially yours,\" \"Fraternally yours,\" or the\r\npronoun with any appropriate adverb which the originality of the\r\nwriter may suggest. Less abrupt, but not less formal, endings are:\r\n\"With best regards, I am,\" etc.; \"With kindest regards, I remain,\"\r\netc.; \"Believe me Very sincerely yours.\"\r\n\r\nFor intimate letters either to relatives or friends no specified\r\nsuggestions are needed. The ordinary form, \"Your affectionate\r\ndaughter,\" or \"niece,\" etc., may, however, be employed, in dearth of\r\nspecial inspiration.\r\n\r\nDistinction is sometimes made between business and social letters by\r\nthe position of \"Yours,\"--it being placed before the adverb in social\r\ncorrespondence, and after in business. The tone of the letter may be\r\nleft to guide in this matter. There is an abruptness always somewhat\r\nunpleasant in the use of the adverb alone.\r\n\r\nMake the beginning and ending of a letter the same in degree of\r\ncordiality. Do not begin formally \"My dear Madam,\" and end \"Cordially\r\nyours.\"\r\n\r\nEvery letter should be signed with the full name of the writer. A\r\npossible exception might be made of those addressed to members of\r\none's own family, where the use of the Christian name only would mean\r\nno ambiguity, or where the signing of the surname gives a touch of\r\nformality. It is well, however, to remember that letters placed in\r\nthe post take the chances of fortune, and, with the plainest of\r\naddresses, may, by the absence of the person or for some other cause,\r\nbring up in the Dead-Letter Office. Their resurrection there will\r\ndepend upon their containing the full name of the sender as well as\r\nhis address. If a letter is valuable enough to send, it is valuable\r\nenough to sign, even if the signature be double,--first the familiar\r\nor given name, and then, in the lower left-hand corner, the full name.\r\n\r\nIt is well to use always the name which is your legal signature. This\r\nwill prevent confusion, and forestall the possibility of your putting,\r\nfrom force of habit, the wrong form of your name upon a legal\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nIt is well to write one's name in full. Three complete names are none\r\ntoo many for individual distinction in so crowded a world as is ours.\r\nIf, however, the middle one is represented by an initial only, always\r\nwrite it uniformly. It is better, if the form with initial only has\r\nnot become really established, to use the full name, although it may\r\nbe long.\r\n\r\nThe form of one's signature and the style of the handwriting soon\r\nbecome habitual. Therefore, every effort should be made to make and\r\nkeep it legible. An illegible signature is unpardonable,--save perhaps\r\non a page at the top of which a printed or engraved letterhead gives\r\nthe name in full. There is, however, the danger that the writer of the\r\nillegible signature will sometime sign his name on a legal document,\r\nor a sheet not bearing his letterhead, and the signature stand for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letters of Introduction_\r\n\r\nA letter of introduction should never be requested. If it is offered\r\nit is a sign of great regard. If it is greatly desired, it might be\r\nwell to acquaint the person, in whose power it is to offer it, with\r\nthe circumstances and interests which make it desirable, but never to\r\ndo more than this.\r\n\r\nThe advisability of giving letters of introduction depends upon the\r\ncircumstances. Between business acquaintances and for business\r\npurposes, it is a common form of establishing connection among various\r\ninterests, and, if done with discrimination, is to be approved. It\r\nshould, however, even in business be done sparingly, as it is a matter\r\nof personal friendship, usually, and as no one has a right to make\r\nnumerous or exacting demands upon one's friends.\r\n\r\nSocially it is a matter of great delicacy, and should have even more\r\nrestrictions put upon it than does the introduction in company. For\r\nthe written introduction is used because distance prevents the\r\npersonal one, and that usually throws the recipient of such a letter\r\ninto the position of host to the traveler or newcomer, or at least of\r\nbenefactor to some degree. It places upon him an obligation not\r\ninvolved in the verbal introduction, and the presumption is that he is\r\nto do some favor, or show some special attention.\r\n\r\nLetters of introduction may be explanatory or brief. Brevity is\r\npreferable, but circumstances must determine.\r\n\r\nA visiting card is often used with the words \"Introducing Mr. Allan\r\nGolding to Mr. Morris,\" or similar form, written across the top. The\r\ncard should be enclosed in a small envelope and left unsealed.\r\n\r\nA brief form of letter simply says: \"Permit me to introduce to your\r\nfavorable notice Mr. Silas Emerson.\"\r\n\r\nA more explicit form would be a letter the body of which would\r\nresemble the following:\r\n\r\n\"The bearer, Mr. Mark W. Allen, who is an old friend and neighbor of\r\nmine, represents the Altmann Irrigation Company, and is desirous of\r\nobtaining information in regard to the system of waterways lately put\r\ninto your county. Knowing your influential position in regard to all\r\nmatters of public interest, I have sent him to you in the hope that\r\nyou may be able to put him in touch with the people who will give him\r\nthe desired information. Any favor that you may do Mr. Allen, or any\r\ncourtesy that you may extend to him, will be deeply appreciated by\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nA purely social letter of introduction would say in substance: \"Mrs.\r\nArthur L. Westmore, who presents this letter to you, is an intimate\r\nand cherished friend of mine, and one whom I know you would desire to\r\nmeet. She is to spend some little time in your city, and any courtesy\r\nthat you may do her I shall deeply appreciate. I have told her of our\r\nfriendship, and she knows how highly I value you, and is eager to meet\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a letter of introduction is given, it is well to write the\r\nreceiver concerning the friend who will present it, that he may not be\r\ntaken unawares, nor continue long ignorant of the claims of that\r\nfriend upon him.\r\n\r\nA gentleman usually presents such a letter by calling in person and\r\nsending in the letter, together with one of his personal cards, by the\r\nservant who answers the bell, or by the office boy. A lady usually\r\nmails the letter and one of her cards giving her address. She should\r\nreceive an acknowledgment with a call or offer of hospitality within a\r\nday or two.\r\n\r\nA person who makes use of a letter of introduction should acknowledge\r\nto the giver the courtesy he has received, with due gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letters of Recommendation_\r\n\r\nLetters of recommendation should be sparingly given. It is becoming\r\nless and less important, in the minds of experienced employers, to\r\ndemand references. The personality of the applicant counts, and the\r\nvarying traits which different positions cultivate make the\r\nexperiences of the past of but little guidance, save in a broad and\r\ngeneral way.\r\n\r\nThe giving of recommendations at random, \"To whom it may concern,\" is\r\nalso less done than formerly, as there is such uncertainty in regard\r\nto their use. Instead of this, the servant is told that she may use\r\nthe former mistress's name as reference. The new, would-be employer\r\nthen writes a note of inquiry to the former employer.\r\n\r\nIn replying to such a note great conscientiousness should be shown.\r\nFull justice should be done the servant. Only the truth should be\r\ntold, and as much of it as a generous heart and wise conscience,\r\ncoupled with a sense of responsibility toward the inquirer, permit.\r\nThese letters should be brief and not effusive on any point, nor\r\nevasive of the issue at stake.\r\n\r\nNever write to another, asking for information, or a favor of any\r\nkind, without enclosing a stamped and addressed envelope for reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Third-person Letters_\r\n\r\nLetters are written in the third person in answer to formal\r\ninvitations so worded, and in correspondence between people but\r\nslightly acquainted or known to each other only by reputation, persons\r\nnot social equals, and by tradespeople and their patrons.\r\n\r\nGreat care should be taken to preserve the impersonal diction\r\nthroughout the letter, and to refrain from signing it. The tone should\r\nalways be formal and very polite.\r\n\r\nAn order may take the form of a request, as \"Will Mr. Sutherland\r\nplease . . . and oblige,\" with the signature of the writer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Informal Invitations and Announcements_\r\n\r\nIn inviting a friend to visit you, it is customary to mention the\r\nlength of the visit, setting a definite date for it and limit to it.\r\nThis makes it possible for both hostess and guest to arrange other\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\nA time-table of the trains, if the guest comes from the distance, with\r\nan account of the trolley lines, if from near at hand, should be\r\nenclosed.\r\n\r\nThe engagement of a daughter may be announced by informal notes to\r\none's whole circle of friends and acquaintances. The following form\r\nof note may serve as a suggestion: \"I am sure that you will join our\r\nhousehold in sympathy with Eleanor in her happiness when I tell you\r\nthat she has just announced her engagement to Mr. Harold Farnham, a\r\nman of whom her father and I thoroughly approve. The wedding will not\r\ntake place for some months, but felicitations are in order.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letters of Condolence_\r\n\r\nA letter of condolence should be short and quite sincere, or else the\r\ncourteous custom of sending it is more honored in the breach than in\r\nthe observance.\r\n\r\nSuch letters should be sent very promptly.\r\n\r\nTo expatiate to any extent whatever upon the bereavement is heartless\r\nor thoughtless, and as there is no danger of ambiguity, the letter\r\ndoes not need to account for itself in any way.\r\n\r\nThe following letter is as explicit as any letter of condolence need\r\never be, and the second form is preferable, unless great intimacy\r\nmakes the less abrupt one permissible.\r\n\r\n        \"DEAR MR. LEGROW:\r\n\r\n        I have read of your bereavement with the deepest\r\n        sorrow. I cannot tell you how fully I sympathize with\r\n        you and your children, or how my heart aches for you\r\n        in your loneliness. May you have strength and grace\r\n        to bear up under the great loss you have sustained.\r\n\r\n                               Sincerely yours,\r\n                                        MARGARET EDELSTONE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"DEAR MRS. HILCOX:\r\n              You have my deepest sympathy.\r\n                        Ever cordially yours,\r\n                                  MILDRED HASSELTINE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Answering Letters_\r\n\r\nBusiness letters should be answered by return mail, as should also all\r\ninvitations to dinner or luncheon.\r\n\r\nAll invitations should be answered within a day if possible, because\r\ndelay looks like a reluctance to accept. They should certainly be\r\nanswered, either personally or by letter, within a week after the\r\ninvitation is received.\r\n\r\nFriendly letters should have such promptness of response as\r\ncircumstances and the intimacy of the friendship demand.\r\n\r\nNotes of congratulation and felicitation should be sent promptly after\r\nreceiving the card or note announcement of an engagement or a birth,\r\nand in the latter case at least, should be followed by a call.\r\n\r\nA personal visiting card, with the words \"Thank you for sympathy\"\r\nwritten over the name, is sufficient acknowledgment of letters of\r\ncondolence. To very intimate friends, however, the spontaneous note of\r\nthanks would be more courteous. As it is almost impossible, at such a\r\ntime, to attend to matters of social intercourse, the sending of the\r\ncard is always permissible, and can occasion no offense, even if the\r\nmore intimate acknowledgment was hoped for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCASUAL MEETINGS AND CALLS\r\n\r\n_Greetings and Recognitions_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE bow and the handshake are the accepted forms of greeting in the\r\nUnited States to-day. The bow varies from a very slight inclination of\r\nthe head, as one gentleman passes another, or from the quick touching\r\nof the hat with the hand, in a sort of reminiscence of the military\r\nsalute, to the various degrees of elaborate bow which savors of\r\nEuropean ceremonial courtesy.\r\n\r\nThe usual form is a bending of the head and shoulders, with the eyes\r\nkept on those of the person greeted, the hat being removed from the\r\nhead and held in the right hand during the bow,--which is at once\r\nbrief, deferential, and dignified. It may be accompanied by the\r\nhandshake, in which case the hat is lifted by the left hand.\r\n\r\nThe degree of the depth of the bow is usually spontaneous, determined\r\nby the deference felt, or the emotions which the meeting may summon.\r\nIt is useless to bow low to conceal scorn or real disdain, for they\r\nare sure to reveal themselves in the artificiality of the pose, or in\r\nthe carriage of the shoulders, or in the movement of an eyelash, and\r\nusually nobody is deceived.\r\n\r\nThe correct position for an extreme bow is with the feet near\r\ntogether, the legs straight, and the entire body inclined from the\r\nhips. This is somewhat too extreme for common use, and should be\r\nmodified always in public, the less elaborate bow being much\r\npreferable upon the street or in public places.\r\n\r\nA woman bows more erectly than a man does, and gives perhaps as\r\ncordial an impression by the greater expressiveness of her greeting,\r\nwhich should always be characteristic, and never mechanical, or in\r\nimitation of others, whose natural traits may be far different,\r\nhowever admirable she may consider their style to be. It is only when\r\nshe meets some one her senior, or in much more important social\r\nposition, or one whom she specially delights to honor, that she\r\nelaborates her bow, or curtsies if not in public and if the occasion\r\nadmit of the formality.\r\n\r\nA lady should be straightforward in her greeting, never condescending\r\nto the coquettish mannerism of letting the eyes fall during the bow.\r\nShe should sink her personal consciousness in the fact of meeting\r\nanother, and should not intrude it into the intellectual interest of\r\nsuch a meeting.\r\n\r\nThe handshake is accomplished by extending the right hand horizontally\r\nfrom the elbow and clasping, between the closed four fingers and thumb\r\nof the hand, the closed four fingers of the friend's right hand, then\r\nquietly shaking it. This is sometimes varied by lifting the clasped\r\nhands,--not the elbow,--to the height of the shoulders, and there\r\nmildly shaking them, or clasping them with a slight pressure and\r\nletting them drop,--styles savoring of affectation. The impulse\r\nprompting the handshake,--that of getting together in intimate\r\npersonal greeting,--is accomplished when the clasp is ended, and\r\nvigorous and prolonged shaking, or special pressure, or continued\r\nholding of the hand, are all alike unpardonable.\r\n\r\nThe bow is the least sign of recognition, and may mean little or much,\r\nbut its significance is known only to the two concerned. While it is\r\npermissible in public places to make its cordiality, or lack of it,\r\napparent, it is not permissible to greet fellow guests at any private\r\nsocial function with either more or less than a uniform and impartial\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\nThe bow does not mean that one has a calling acquaintance. It may mean\r\nonly a casual knowledge of one another's existence, due to some brief\r\ncoming together. Intentionally to neglect to bow, after a bowing\r\nacquaintance has once been established, is an open affront, and\r\ndenotes either extreme rudeness or veiled insult. The dropping of an\r\nacquaintance by refusal to recognize, may, in our complicated social\r\nsystem, sometimes be necessary, but it is only justified by the\r\nnecessity for society to safeguard itself against some of the more\r\nflagrant social abuses.\r\n\r\nIt is a woman's privilege, in meeting a man whom she knows, to bow\r\nfirst. Indeed, the man always waits for her to do so, unless he is a\r\nvery intimate friend. A woman should always be sure, before bowing to\r\na man, that she knows him and that she has caught his eye.\r\n\r\nWhen a gentleman is walking with a lady, he lifts his hat when she\r\nbows to an acquaintance, even if the person is not known to him. So,\r\nalso, when he is alone and meets a man whom he knows, who is in the\r\ncompany of a lady, he lifts his hat. When, walking with a lady, he\r\nmeets a gentleman whom he knows, he removes his hat.\r\n\r\nWhen a gentleman meets a party of ladies or stops to speak with one\r\nonly, it is customary for him to retain his hat in his hand until she\r\nrequests him to replace it. This is done with social superiors and\r\nto show great respect, being more ceremonial than finds common\r\nacceptance among Americans.\r\n\r\nWhen he is with a gentleman who bows to a lady, he also lifts his hat.\r\nIt is proper for him to lift the hat when offering any courtesy to a\r\nlady, even though a total stranger, and upon leaving a lady with whom\r\nhe or a person accompanying him has been talking.\r\n\r\nIt is well to return a bow which is directed to you, even if you do\r\nnot know the one bowing. This often saves considerable embarrassment\r\nto the one who has for the moment mistaken you for some one else.\r\n\r\nWhen passing before ladies seated in a lecture hall, or concert, a\r\ngentleman always asks their pardon for troubling them.\r\n\r\nIn passing or repassing on the street or promenade, a single bow is\r\nsufficient recognition, even though you may meet an acquaintance\r\nseveral times.\r\n\r\nA lady, receiving in her own home, shakes hands with the stranger with\r\nthe same cordiality as with the friend.\r\n\r\nA gentleman when greeting a lady never takes the initiative in\r\nhand-shaking. If a lady offers her hand, however, it would be very\r\nrude indeed for a gentleman not to accept the courtesy.\r\n\r\nPersons who have met at the house of a mutual friend, but have not\r\nbeen introduced, are under no obligation to bow when they meet\r\nelsewhere afterward, and usually do not.\r\n\r\nWhen a man passes a lady on a staircase, in the corridor of a hotel,\r\nin the elevator of a private apartment house, or in the public rooms\r\nof a hotel, he lifts his hat although she may be a stranger.\r\n\r\nThis rule does not prevail on the staircases and in the corridors of\r\noffice buildings, with the exception, perhaps, of banks and such\r\noffices as people of wealth frequent; for a new fineness of courtesy\r\nhas made men feel that, as women are winning an equality of position\r\nin the business field, a delicate way of recognizing that equality is\r\nby giving them a comradely deference rather than paying them the\r\nsocial attentions. Another marked expression of this is in the fact\r\nthat a business man, when walking on the street with a business woman,\r\ndoes not interrupt their conversation by changing sides with her in\r\norder to keep constantly on the outside of the walk.\r\n\r\nAn indication of the two kinds of courtesy, social and business, is\r\noften grotesquely shown when a woman in social life, perhaps the wife\r\nof one of the men present, enters an office where there are both men\r\nand women of equal business importance and social rank. There is an\r\nelaborate social courtesy paid to the wife, who is in private life,\r\nwhich would not be paid, and would seem grotesque and ill-mannered if\r\npaid, to the business woman, even though she were at once the active\r\nvice president of the corporation and wife of the president.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Introductions_\r\n\r\nThe usual form of introduction is, \"Mrs. Allen, may I present Mr.\r\nBrown?\" Or, \"Mrs. Allen, let me present Mr. Brown.\" Or, \"Mrs.\r\nCaldwell, allow me to present Colonel Glazier.\" Where, however, the\r\npermission need not be suggested, and the relative standing of the\r\npeople is the same, the form may be only, \"Mrs. Gleason, Mr. Ansel.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it is necessary to introduce one person to several, the form is,\r\n\"Mrs. Gladstone, I want you to meet Mrs. Falmouth, Miss Washburn, Mr.\r\nCronkshaw, and Mr. Edgerton.\" The one introduced simply repeats each\r\nname and smiles as she greets each in turn.\r\n\r\nAnother form much in use is, \"Miss Hanscom, I want you to know my\r\nfriend, Mr. Thompson, the artist,\" and is preferable because of its\r\ndefiniteness.\r\n\r\nThe response to an introduction is, \"I am happy to meet you,\" or, \"I\r\nam very glad to meet you.\"\r\n\r\nIf one does not catch the name of the person introduced, it is proper\r\nto ask it, saying, \"Pardon me, but I did not understand the name.\"\r\n\r\nIntroductions should always be spoken distinctly, especially the\r\nnames. If, in introducing, one can add a sentence which will give a\r\nsubject of conversation, the preliminaries of acquaintance may be\r\nspeedily passed, and memorable information and real profit be gleaned\r\nfrom even a casual meeting.\r\n\r\nIt is a mark of intelligence and social instinct to be quick to catch\r\nand retain in memory a face and name from even a brief introduction,\r\nand the tacit compliment to the person so remembered is apt to win his\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nPersons who have not been introduced are not considered acquainted.\r\nThe exceptions to this rule are the guests under a common roof, while\r\nthey are there.\r\n\r\nIntroductions should never be indiscriminately made. There should be\r\nwillingness, if not eagerness, on the part of both to meet. A hostess\r\nis, however, warranted in introducing two people who she knows will be\r\ncongenial, or if they have before expressed a desire to become\r\nacquainted. If any doubt exists as to how the introduction will be\r\nreceived by either, they should not be introduced.\r\n\r\nOne should never introduce two acquaintances who reside in the same\r\ntown but move in different social circles, unless each had desired the\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nIf there is a difference of station or age, then it is necessary only\r\nto ask the older or more prominent person whether the introduction\r\nwould be acceptable. This should be done quietly, and quite out of\r\nhearing or knowledge of the other person concerned.\r\n\r\nA gentleman should ask a mutual friend for an introduction to a lady\r\nwhom he wishes to meet. Unless there is no possible objection, the\r\nmutual friend should not introduce the gentleman until he has made\r\nsure that the lady is willing.\r\n\r\nIt is not well to introduce gentlemen to one another indiscriminately,\r\nnor should ladies be so introduced. One wishes to keep the boundaries\r\nof one's acquaintance within certain definite limits, and choice is\r\neasier made before acquaintance than after. So, one shows great care\r\nin offering introductions to others, and exercises the same care for\r\none's self.\r\n\r\nIf a hostess and her guest are out walking together, the hostess would\r\nintroduce to her guest every friend who happened to stop and speak\r\nwith her, and the guest, should she meet acquaintances of her own,\r\nwould introduce each of them to her hostess. This is practically the\r\nonly case where indiscriminate introducing is good form, and here the\r\nobligations of hospitality safeguard it.\r\n\r\nA lady usually offers her hand to a gentleman who has been introduced\r\nto her, but a bow, a smile, and a repetition of the name are all that\r\nis necessary where several introductions are being made, as at a\r\nlarge reception or dancing party.\r\n\r\nA gentleman always offers his hand to another gentleman on being\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nAn elderly lady may offer her hand in all introductions with perfect\r\npropriety.\r\n\r\nIf, while walking out with a friend, you meet another, do not\r\nintroduce the two. A transient meeting is of no particular moment to\r\nthem, and their friendship or acquaintance with you is not necessarily\r\nof strong enough interest to make them desire acquaintance. If,\r\nhowever, you meet at some public place, and are detained there\r\ntogether for several minutes, then the introduction should be given.\r\n\r\nWhen meeting at the house of a mutual acquaintance, friends may\r\nintroduce friends, but it is preferable to leave the introductions to\r\nthe hostess.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer necessary to introduce each guest to everybody else at\r\na party. Introductions are made as opportunity or necessity may\r\ndictate. This abolishing of promiscuous and wholesale introductions\r\nrelieves two very embarrassing situations,--that of being introduced\r\nby announcement to a whole roomful of people, and that of being taken\r\naround and introduced to them singly.\r\n\r\nA mother may present her son, or a sister her brother, or a wife her\r\nhusband, if she so desires, without any question as to the propriety\r\nof it. A man should not, on the other hand, introduce another man to\r\nhis wife, or a son or brother make a presentation of a man to his\r\nmother or sister, unless he knows that such acquaintance could not but\r\nbe agreeable to the lady, and unless it meets with his own approval.\r\nFor it is a man's place always to safeguard a woman against\r\nundesirable acquaintances.\r\n\r\nA woman, in introducing her husband, gives him his title, if he has\r\none, as \"Judge Hartwell,\" \"Doctor Foley.\" The wife of the President of\r\nthe United States speaks of him only as \"The President,\" and in\r\npresenting people to him, he is always addressed as \"Mr. President,\"\r\nwith the invariable omission of his surname.\r\n\r\nA friend or acquaintance, no matter how distinguished, is always\r\npresented to one's father or mother or one's intimate relative, where\r\nthe intimacy of the relation makes an honor more distinguishing, in\r\nthe mind of the introducer, than any of reputation or position.\r\n\r\nA young man should be introduced to an older man, a young woman to an\r\nolder woman.\r\n\r\nA man is always presented to a woman, never the reverse.\r\n\r\nIf a lady is seated and a man is presented to her, she need not rise.\r\nIf two ladies, both seated, are introduced to each other, they should\r\nrise, unless one is old or an invalid, in which case both remain\r\nseated. Two gentlemen, though both are seated, rise and shake hands\r\nwhen introduced.\r\n\r\nA young lady always rises when an elderly person is introduced.\r\n\r\nIntroductions are not made at table. The guests at a dinner party\r\nshould be presented to one another in the drawing-room before coming\r\nto the table, and if that is impossible, as many should be introduced\r\nas may be, especially those who are to sit beside or near or opposite\r\neach other. If one is seated beside a guest whom he has not met, the\r\nman takes the initiative in speaking a few words as soon as he takes\r\nhis seat, to which the lady responds always cordially, keeping up more\r\nor less of a conversation during the dinner.\r\n\r\nAt dancing parties all those who are giving the party, as well as all\r\nthe ushers and those who receive, make introductions as general as\r\npossible, so as to insure the pleasure of the guests during the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nAn introduction at a dance carries with it the obligation on the part\r\nof the man to ask the woman for a dance, and on her part to grant his\r\nrequest unless her card is full.\r\n\r\nWhen traveling great care should be taken as to introductions.\r\n\r\nAs a guest one should be ready and willing to meet any one whom his\r\nhost or hostess may introduce, even though it be an enemy. The\r\nobligations of hospitality rest nowhere more heavily than in this\r\nmatter. They demand that impartial courtesy should be shown to every\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calls_\r\n\r\nCalls must be made in person, rather than by card left by messenger or\r\npost, after an invitation to dinner, luncheon, supper, or similar\r\nfunction, and that within a week or, at farthest, two weeks of the\r\ndate of the affair. One should also call in person within two weeks of\r\nany entertainment to which one has been asked, especially if one has\r\nattended.\r\n\r\nOne need repay formal calls, where no invitation to any social\r\noccasion has been received, only once a year. Even in this case, cards\r\nmay be sent by mail. In the country it is usual to go in person,\r\nthough one does not ask if the lady of the house is at home.\r\n\r\nCalls should be made upon the \"At Home\" day, if one is engraved upon\r\nthe card. If a person is ill, a near relative, or intimate friend, may\r\nleave a card for her at the house of the friend upon whom she wished\r\nto call.\r\n\r\nSociety holds young people who are free to attend parties and\r\nentertainments under stern obligation to pay their social calls.\r\nYoung mothers, professional women, students, invalids, and\r\nsemi-invalids are not expected to conform rigidly to the same rules.\r\nIf a young woman can go to a party to amuse herself, she must call\r\nafterwards to acknowledge the courtesy of the invitation.\r\n\r\nIf a mother cannot call in person, her daughter or some one else may\r\npay the necessary calls in her stead. Or she may invite the people\r\nwhom she would otherwise call on, to an afternoon tea, which is more\r\nof a compliment than a call.\r\n\r\nIn calling at a house, should the door be opened by a member of the\r\nfamily, the caller does not present her card to the lady or gentleman,\r\nbut steps in, asking for the person whom she wants to see. She may\r\nleave her card unobtrusively on the table when she goes out.\r\n\r\nIf a maid opens the door, the card is handed to her and received on a\r\nsmall tray. No well-trained maid ever extends her hand to receive a\r\nvisiting card.\r\n\r\nIf a caller wishes to be very formal, she leaves a card for every lady\r\nin the family on whom she wishes to call.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the season a wife always leaves her husband's card\r\nwith her own, and she usually does this also when making a call at the\r\nclose of the season.\r\n\r\nAn unmarried woman calling on a married friend leaves only one card.\r\nIf the friend has daughters or is entertaining a guest, a card may be\r\nleft for each.\r\n\r\nA lady always rises to receive a visitor.\r\n\r\nIt takes good judgment to know when to go, but it should be cultivated\r\nand practised. Lingering in taking one's leave is a great weariness,\r\nto one's hostess if not to one's self.\r\n\r\nAfter a birth calls are made upon the mother after the child is a\r\nmonth old.\r\n\r\nAfter a death the friends of the family should call in person inside\r\nof a month. The members of the family do not receive them, however,\r\nunless they wish to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Social Calls of Men_\r\n\r\nA man never carries or leaves the cards of other men, nor can he leave\r\ncards for any of the women of his family.\r\n\r\nA gentleman who calls on a lady's afternoon at home leaves in the card\r\ntray, on entering the house, a card for his hostess and one for his\r\nhost. The card for his host must be left, even if that gentleman does\r\nnot appear in the drawing-room, provided the caller is acquainted with\r\nhim, and providing he is calling in acknowledgment of some hospitality\r\nrecently received.\r\n\r\nIf there is a host, hostess, and young lady daughter in the house,\r\nand the caller is a friend of the latter, he leaves three cards.\r\n\r\nThe man who is making his first or last call for the season on the\r\nregular afternoon at home, leaves one card for each of the ladies, and\r\neach one of the men of the household whose acquaintance he can claim.\r\n\r\nWhen a man calls on a lady's day at home, and his call has no\r\nreference to any social debts, he leaves only one card in the tray. If\r\nhe is somewhat intimate in the house where the call is paid, he leaves\r\nno card at all.\r\n\r\nA man does not call upon a woman unless she invites him, or some\r\nmember of her family does, or he goes with a mutual friend who has\r\nmade sure of his welcome. A woman may say to a man, \"Mother and I are\r\nusually at home Fridays, and would like to have you call,\" or some\r\nother form of invitation which denotes cordiality.\r\n\r\nA man who desires to call in particular upon one lady, in a family\r\nwhere there are several, hands his card to the servant with the words,\r\n\"Please give this to Miss Curley, and I would like to see all the\r\nother ladies also.\" The ladies appear and greet him, withdrawing that\r\nhe may call upon the one he especially wished to see.\r\n\r\nIf calling upon a guest in a home, you always ask for the hostess\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nA man retains his hat, gloves, and walking stick in hand during a\r\nformal call, though he may have left his overcoat in the hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n_First Calls_\r\n\r\nIn America it is the usual custom for residents of the city or town to\r\ncall first upon newcomers. Washington is a well-known exception to\r\nthis rule, as strangers there call first upon government officials and\r\ntheir families. In most European cities newcomers call first upon\r\nthose already in residence. The residents, from the officials down,\r\nreturn their cards, and the visitor or newcomer receives invitations\r\nto social functions.\r\n\r\nIn practice the resident does not usually know anything about the\r\nstranger, and may not have even heard of her arrival. Sometimes the\r\nnewcomer sends out cards for several days in a month, to those with\r\nwhom she would like to become acquainted. If she can enclose the card\r\nof a mutual friend, as a silent voucher for her social standing, her\r\nposition is more quickly and more surely granted her.\r\n\r\nClergymen and their families, brides, and persons of note are entitled\r\nto receive first calls. The older residents of the community are\r\nexpected to lead in the list of callers who welcome the newcomers.\r\n\r\nFirst calls should be promptly returned, within a week at the very\r\nlatest.\r\n\r\nA married woman making a first call upon a married friend sends one of\r\nher own and two of her husband's cards to her new acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE PERSONAL CARD AND THE ENGRAVED INVITATION\r\n\r\n\r\n_Form of Card_\r\n\r\nA MAN'S card is usually one and a half by three inches in size, and\r\nmade of fairly stiff bristol board. A woman's card is usually about\r\ntwo and three-sixteenths by three inches, and made of dull-finish,\r\nfine, medium-weight bristol board.\r\n\r\nThe color of cards is a fine pearl white. Cream or tinted cards are\r\nnever in good form.\r\n\r\nThe engraving varies from plain script to elaborate Old English text,\r\nor shaded Roman type, according to the fashion. The engraver may be\r\ntrusted to know the style and stock most in use.\r\n\r\nThe card of an unmarried lady should be somewhat smaller than that of\r\nthe married. This distinction is made, however, only in case of the\r\ncard of the debutante.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inscription_\r\n\r\nIf there is room across the card the full name should be engraved. If\r\nthe names are too long, only the initials of given names should be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nAll inscriptions on one card should be in the same style of type.\r\n\r\n\"Mr.\" is prefixed, unless there is a special title, such as,\r\n\"Reverend,\" \"Doctor,\" \"Colonel,\" etc. If a man should, in an\r\nemergency, write his own name on a card, he would not prefix the\r\n\"Mr.,\" or any other title. The name should be written in full and\r\nshould be an autograph.\r\n\r\nA married lady should have her husband's full name, or such form or\r\nparts of it as he uses, with the title \"Mrs.,\" and not her own name.\r\n\r\nA young woman has the title \"Miss\" engraved before her name, even\r\nthough she be only a schoolgirl.\r\n\r\nA young man has no title at all on his card, but simply his full name.\r\n\r\nThe newly married couple use a card with the title of \"Mr. and Mrs.\"\r\nfor the first year after marriage, in returning their ceremonious\r\ncalls after the wedding, and paying formal calls when the husband is\r\nunable to accompany the wife. These cards should have the address in\r\nthe lower right-hand corner, and the reception day or days in the\r\nlower left. After the first year they are seldom used in paying calls,\r\nbut can be used for condolence, congratulation, or farewell where both\r\nhusband and wife desire to be formally represented.\r\n\r\nA woman who is personally distinguished, who occupies a high social\r\nposition, or whose husband stands at the head of his family, may have\r\nonly \"Mrs. Barnaby,\" not \"Mrs. John Barnaby,\" upon her cards. It is\r\nbetter, however, not to do so unless one has the indisputable right to\r\nbe considered as _the_ Mrs. Barnaby of the locality. It is customary\r\nfor the wife of the oldest brother of the oldest branch of the family\r\nalone to have the privilege of this form.\r\n\r\nThe same rule of precedence applies to single women. The oldest\r\nunmarried daughter of the oldest brother, and she alone, has the right\r\nto use \"Miss Campbell\" on her card, although she may have a cousin who\r\nis much older than herself, but who is the daughter of a younger\r\nbrother of the same family.\r\n\r\nA widow has no cards during her year of mourning, as she makes no\r\nformal visits. After that, cards with black border to any depth\r\ndesired may be used.\r\n\r\nA widow has no legal right to retain her husband's Christian name, but\r\nshe often prefers to do so, and it is entirely proper, the question\r\nbeing one of sentiment alone. In case there is a married son of the\r\nsame name as the father, then it is proper for the mother to put \"Sr.\"\r\nfor Senior, at the end of her name, should she desire still to retain\r\nher husband's Christian name.\r\n\r\nIn such a case widows occasionally prefer to use their own names or\r\ninitials.\r\n\r\nIn this country a married woman merges her name with that of her\r\nhusband. It is not uncommon nowadays for married women to sign their\r\nown Christian name, their maiden surname, and their husband's surname\r\nas their signature. There is value in this as it preserves the family\r\nidentity of the married woman, but the question of its legality may\r\nalways be raised.\r\n\r\nThe name of daughter or daughters is often engraved below that of the\r\nmother on her card, before the young woman enters formally into\r\nsociety. The form \"The Misses Smith\" may be used, or the names given\r\nseparately. In New York in some circles the debutante is not given a\r\nseparate card until she has been in society a year. As American\r\nschoolgirls often have a card with the prefix \"Miss,\" the debutante\r\nmay use this among her girl friends.\r\n\r\nTo write anything on an engraved card except \"Condolences,\"\r\n\"Congratulations,\" \"_P. p. c._,\" is not considered good style,\r\nalthough a lady may use her visiting card with \"Five o'clock tea,\"\r\n\"Music,\" or a special date written upon it as an informal invitation\r\nto a musical or \"At Home.\"\r\n\r\nA business or professional woman may have, in addition to her society\r\ncard, a card with her own name for business purposes. This usually has\r\na word or two denoting her profession in the lower left-hand corner,\r\nand her business address in the lower right.\r\n\r\nA lady's card should always contain her home address in the lower\r\nright-hand corner. Her afternoon \"At Home\" is usually given in the\r\nlower left.\r\n\r\nThe address is often omitted from cards for men, being engraved on\r\nthose of the women of the family. Men belonging to a fashionable or\r\nwell-known club put its name, instead of their residence, on their\r\ncards. This is especially the case when they do not live at home. If\r\nliving at a club, the address is put on the lower left-hand corner; if\r\nliving at home, the lower right-hand corner.\r\n\r\nOn a man's business cards the title \"Mr.\" is omitted, the name of his\r\nfirm, their business, and address, being engraved in the lower\r\nleft-hand corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Titles_\r\n\r\nTitles which signify permanent rank, or profession that lasts for\r\nlife, and which are allied to a man's identity or distinctly bear\r\nupon his social standing, should be used.\r\n\r\nTemporary titles, which have no special social rank or bearing, or\r\nprofessional titles, such as \"Esquire\" for lawyers, which have no\r\nsocial significance, are not used.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason that temporary or technical titles are not used,\r\nhonorary titles are omitted. There should be no pretense in regard to\r\nsocial position, as pretense is easy and futile. A man appears in\r\nsociety simply as an ordinary individual, to win favor and position by\r\nforce of his personality, or to lose it thereby.\r\n\r\nAn army or a naval officer, a physician, a judge, or a clergyman may\r\nuse his title on his card, as, for instance, \"Captain James Smith,\"\r\n\"Judge Henry Gray,\" \"Rev. Thomas Jones, D. D.\" The card of an\r\nAssociate Justice of the United States Supreme Court at Washington\r\nreads \"Mr. Justice Holmes.\" Military or complimentary titles are not\r\nused, nor are coats of arms. In this republican country it is\r\nconsidered an affectation and bad taste so to make use of them.\r\nPolitical and judicial titles are also omitted, as are academic\r\ntitles, such as Chancellor, Dean, and Professor.\r\n\r\nNo title below the rank of Captain is used on the card in military\r\ncircles. A lieutenant's card would give his full name with the prefix\r\n\"Mr.\" and below it the words, \"Lieutenant of Fifth Cavalry, United\r\nStates Army,\" or simply, \"United States Coast Guard Service.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Use_\r\n\r\nThe etiquette of the visiting card is a fluctuating one. It cannot be\r\nlaid down for all time, or even for next season.\r\n\r\nOn entering at a reception, or afternoon tea, one leaves a card in the\r\nsalver offered by the butler or attendant who opens the door, or upon\r\nthe hall table, as a reminder to the hostess, who can hardly be\r\nexpected to remember, if entertaining a large number, every one who\r\nhas been there.\r\n\r\nOne does not leave cards at a wedding reception, however.\r\n\r\nAt an afternoon tea, it is no longer necessary to leave a card apiece\r\nfrom all the members of the invited families to all the members of the\r\nfamily of the hostess and her guests also. The single card for the\r\nhost and hostess is all that is required.\r\n\r\nShould one be invited to a series of receptions, one leaves cards only\r\nonce although one may attend twice. Leaving cards in person after a\r\ntea or reception is good form only for ceremonious affairs. After the\r\nusual private reception one should certainly call.\r\n\r\nIf only one member of a family can attend a reception to which the\r\nothers have been invited, she may leave the cards of the others,\r\ntogether with her own, with perfect propriety.\r\n\r\nAlso when one is not able to attend a reception or an afternoon tea,\r\ncards may be sent by mail, although it is better to send them by\r\nmessenger, to arrive on the day of the entertainment. One should call\r\nwithin a fortnight.\r\n\r\nIt is not now considered necessary to call in person where formerly it\r\nwas so held. The sending of the personal card often takes the place of\r\nthe call. Nor need this be done by messenger. Cards for any purpose\r\nmay now be sent by mail.\r\n\r\nAfter removing from one part of the city to another, it is customary\r\nfor ladies to send engraved cards with their new address and with\r\ntheir reception day to all of their circle of acquaintances.\r\n\r\nA woman who is stopping for a brief time in a city where she has\r\nfriends, sends to them her card containing her temporary address and\r\nthe length of her stay, as \"Here until June second,\" or \"Here until\r\nSunday.\"\r\n\r\nA man, however, calls upon his friends, and if they are absent leaves\r\nhis card giving the same information.\r\n\r\nIf a son old enough to go into society wishes to do so, his card is\r\nleft with his father's and mother's at the beginning of the season.\r\nHe will then be invited to the functions given by the friends of his\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nWhen there is illness or mourning in the household, friends leave\r\ntheir cards with the words \"To inquire,\" \"Sincere condolence,\" or\r\n\"Sympathy\" written upon them.\r\n\r\nThe card which accompanies wedding gifts should be the joint card of\r\n\"Mr. and Mrs.,\" if the gift is sent jointly, and may well have the\r\nwords \"Best wishes and congratulations,\" written upon it.\r\n\r\nThe initials \"_P. p. c._,\" meaning \"_Pour prendre conge_,\" or \"To take\r\nleave,\" are written upon one's personal cards, which are then sent out\r\nto one's friends when one is going away from a place either\r\npermanently or for a long time. They are usually written in the lower\r\nleft-hand corner of the card. These cards may be sent by post, when\r\nthe person leaving town has not the time to make a personal visit.\r\nThey are not used when leaving town for the summer.\r\n\r\nIt is quite proper to send or leave \"_P. p. c._\" cards when one goes\r\naway from a summer resort, especially if the people to whom they are\r\nsent do not live during the year in the same town or city with the\r\nsender.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer permissible to fold over the ends of a card, to\r\nsignify that it was intended for all the members of the family.\r\n\r\nThe birth of a child may be announced by a small card containing the\r\nfull name of the child daintily engraved, with the date of the birth\r\nin the lower left-hand corner. The card is tied to the mother's card\r\nby white ribbon, and both are enclosed in one envelope and sent by\r\npost.\r\n\r\nVisiting cards for those who are in mourning are the same size as the\r\nordinary card. The width of the black border is regulated by the\r\ndegree of the relationship to the deceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Engraved Invitation_\r\n\r\nA fine grade of heavy, unglazed, pure white paper, suede finish, in\r\ndouble sheet folded to a size about five by seven and a half inches,\r\nor less, inserted in an envelope of the same width but half the\r\nlength, is used for the billet on which wedding invitations and\r\nannouncements are engraved. The impress of the plate demarks a margin\r\nof about an inch.\r\n\r\nA heavy or medium grade of white bristol board is used for invitations\r\nto \"At Homes,\" dinner, receptions, dances, and all like social\r\nfunctions for which the common visiting card is not used. The size\r\nused varies with the number of words in the invitation, and may be\r\nquite large, as for a club or society reception, or formal openings or\r\nspecial occasions where a business corporation is the host. These\r\ncards have the same plate margin as the wedding invitation, although\r\nit is much narrower. Only the most formal invitations have space left\r\nfor the writing in of the name of the guest.\r\n\r\nThe billet, however, has certain advantages, especially where the\r\noccasion is very formal and select, and the information which should\r\nbe furnished the guest is considerable. Elegance of this sort is now\r\nvery costly.\r\n\r\nSeveral styles of type are in use: namely, the script having close\r\nround letters, and being as nearly black as Roman or Old English when\r\nengraved; a script lighter and more cursive; an Old English lettering;\r\na shaded Roman letter, which is constantly growing in popularity;\r\nshaded Caxton; solid and shaded French script; and a plain Roman block\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nThe script is the type most commonly used, both because of its beauty\r\nand legibility, and because of the comparative inexpensiveness of\r\nengraving, the cost being about half of that of either the Old English\r\nor the shaded Roman type.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the size of page in this book will not permit\r\nfacsimile reproductions of specimens of invitations and other social\r\nforms, which in nearly every case require a different proportion of\r\nspace than the page offers. Therefore, to reproduce the style of\r\nlettering used for these forms has not been attempted. The examples\r\npresent correct wording and proportionate arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe following plates, which are exact photographs of steel and copper\r\nengraving, present several styles of script, Old English, and shaded\r\nand plain Roman faces, but do not represent more than a few sizes, and\r\nthose the most common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Type styles and sizes for invitations]\r\n\r\n        _at the Church of the Messiah_\r\n\r\n        _Two Dancing Parties_\r\n\r\n        _request the pleasure of_\r\n\r\n        _At Home_                 _At Home_\r\n\r\n        =announce the marriage of=\r\n\r\n        =BROOKLINE,                    MASSACHUSETTS=\r\n\r\n        =First Unitarian Church=\r\n\r\n        =request the honour of your presence=\r\n\r\n        _=Mr. and Mrs.=_              _=New Hampshire=_\r\n\r\n        =ANNOUNCE THE MARRIAGE OF=\r\n\r\n        =Mr. and Mrs.=\r\n\r\n                        =at Emmanuel Church=\r\n\r\n        =at Warren, Pennsylvania=\r\n\r\n        _=Mrs. William Howell Meade=_\r\n\r\n        _Mrs. William Howell Meade_\r\n\r\n        =Mrs. William Howell Meade=\r\n\r\n        =MRS. WILLIAM HOWELL MEADE=\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dining and Party Invitations_\r\n\r\nThe engraved card invitation for a luncheon is usually worded as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n            _Mrs. Everetts S. Sinclair\r\n        requests the pleasure of your company\r\n                  at Luncheon\r\n          on Tuesday, February nineteenth\r\n                at one o'clock\r\n                 Hotel Willard_\r\n\r\nThe dinner invitation is identical, except that for \"Luncheon\" is\r\nsubstituted \"Dinner,\" and the hour is usually half after seven or\r\neight o'clock. To this, or to any other dining invitation, may be\r\nadded in the lower left-hand corner the words \"Please reply,\" or, \"The\r\nfavor of a reply is requested.\"\r\n\r\nThe party invitation may take either of the two following forms:\r\n\r\n              _Mrs. Harold Harmon Williams\r\n           requests the pleasure of your company\r\n             at a dancing party to be given\r\n               at the Glendale Country Club\r\n        Wednesday evening, December the twenty-ninth\r\n             from eight until eleven o'clock_\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Fairfield Watson\r\n              request the pleasure of_\r\n\r\n              _company at The Somerset Club\r\n        on the evening of Friday the ninth of February\r\n               from nine until one o'clock\r\n        Dancing and Bridge     95 Jackson Boulevard_\r\n\r\nThe blank invitation is very convenient, as it may be sent out at\r\nshort notice, and is definite and personal. The following is a form\r\nwhich lends itself to any one of the usual kinds of home\r\nentertainment:\r\n\r\n        _Mr. and Mrs. St. John Ambrose Lockwood\r\n        request the pleasure of_\r\n\r\n        ........................................\r\n\r\n        _company at_............................\r\n\r\n             _on_............................\r\n\r\n          _at_................................\r\n\r\n                                _97 Washington Avenue_\r\n\r\nWhen, on an engraved invitation of any sort, be it wedding or dinner\r\nor any other, a blank line or lines are left for the insertion of the\r\nname of the guest, there is danger that, unless this is done with\r\ngreat care and by an able penman, the beauty of the invitation be\r\nruined, and therefore its cost thrown away. For that reason a wholly\r\nengraved invitation is perhaps better, unless the work of addressing\r\nthem and inserting the name is to be done by a professional penman. Of\r\ncourse, when this is done and well done, there is a personal touch, a\r\nsuggestion of individual welcome, which can be gained in no other way,\r\nand which the wholly engraved invitation lacks.\r\n\r\nWhen an entertainment is given by a family at some place other than\r\ntheir home, the invitations have the name of the place and the street\r\naddress put in at the usual place on the invitation, and then in the\r\nlower right-hand corner the words \"Please reply,\" with the home\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nA bachelor or widower uses his name alone at the top of the\r\ninvitation. He will, of course, provide a chaperon, who in many\r\nrespects takes the place of a hostess and so acts, but her name does\r\nnot appear upon his invitation, unless she be his sister or near\r\nrelative. The invitation then becomes a joint one, after the usual\r\nform.\r\n\r\nA widower with daughters may send out invitations headed in either of\r\nthe following forms:\r\n\r\n          _Mr. John Marquand_\r\n            _Miss Marquand_\r\n        _Miss Estelle Marquand_\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n         _Mr. John Marquand_\r\n        _The Misses Marquand_\r\n\r\nFor a dinner followed by a dance there are two invitations, the one a\r\ndinner invitation at an early hour for the favored few, the other a\r\ndancing party invitation at a later hour.\r\n\r\nClubs have blanks which may be filled in by their members when they\r\nwish to entertain. These are issued in the club name, and are like any\r\nother private invitation, except that at the bottom and to the left\r\n\"Compliments of\" is engraved, and the name of the member who is\r\nspecial host is written in.\r\n\r\nInvitations containing the words \"_Bal Poudre_\" signify that the\r\nentertainment is a masquerade or fancy dress party, and the guests are\r\nexpected to come in fancy costume with powdered hair.\r\n\r\nThe word \"ball\" is used of an elaborate formal dance, usually a public\r\none given by some club or for charity, and rarely of a private dance.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the predominance of the engraved invitation for the most\r\nformal affairs, still small dinners, and even receptions and dancing\r\nparties, are sometimes announced by the handwritten invitations. The\r\nform should be the same as the engraved one, although to very intimate\r\nfriends it should be changed to a friendly note.\r\n\r\nAcceptances are in the form of the invitation. If that is an informal\r\nnote, the acceptance or regret is sent in the same style. If the\r\ninvitation is formal, the reply also should be written in the third\r\nperson and be about as follows:\r\n\r\n             _Mr. and Mrs. Allston B. Sinclair\r\n        accept with pleasure the kind invitation of\r\n          Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Emanuel Farrington\r\n                     for dinner\r\n           on Thursday, the ninth of December\r\n             at half after eight o'clock_\r\n\r\nThe reply to an invitation should be sent to the person or persons who\r\nissued it, never to any other member of the family, although such a\r\none may be better known.\r\n\r\nTo write the word \"Regrets\" on one's visiting card and send it in\r\ndeclination of any invitation is bad form, even if the invitation come\r\nin similar shape. One should always write a note of regret.\r\n\r\nBachelors and widowers, who entertain at their apartments or studio or\r\nclub, and army and navy officers never use the words \"At Home,\" but\r\nalways \"request the pleasure (or honour) of your presence.\"\r\n\r\nIf one is entertaining a guest and an invitation is received, one may\r\nwith propriety ask the hostess for an invitation for one's guest, if\r\nthe form of entertainment is so general as to make this right and\r\nreasonable; otherwise one must decline the invitation. It would not be\r\nright to ask for another dinner invitation, or one to a select group\r\nof people, where the guest would be an intruder.\r\n\r\nIt is preferable and a much later form to use the words \"Please\r\nreply,\" or \"An early reply is requested,\" rather than the abbreviation\r\n\"_R. s. v. p._\" for \"_Repondez, s'il vous plait_,\" meaning \"Reply, if\r\nyou please.\"\r\n\r\nIf a son should return from college or other absence, and the parents\r\nwish to entertain for him, their invitations would have at the bottom\r\nthe word \"For\" followed by his name.\r\n\r\nIn sending out invitations, one should be sent to the father and\r\nmother jointly, one to each son separately, and one to the daughters\r\njointly, the latter being addressed \"The Misses Estabrook.\"\r\n\r\nInvitations should be sent to people in mourning, although they are\r\nnot expected to accept. They should not be slighted or forgotten\r\nduring such a period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wedding Invitations and Announcements_\r\n\r\nThe following are the usual forms of wording for the wedding\r\ninvitation:\r\n\r\n         _Mr. and Mrs. Reinhard Ernst Ormond_\r\n        _request the honour of your presence_\r\n         _at the marriage of their daughter_\r\n                      _Eida_\r\n                       _to_\r\n                 _Dr. Otto Bertelli_\r\n          _on Wednesday, the first of April_\r\n            _nineteen hundred and thirteen_\r\n                 _at twelve o'clock_\r\n                _Church of the Messiah_\r\n                 _St. Louis, Missouri_\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Mr. Arnold Hamilton Forsyth_\r\n           _requests the pleasure of your company_\r\n          _at the marriage reception of his daughter_\r\n                        _Margaret_\r\n                          _and_\r\n                    _Mr. Walter Mallory_\r\n        _on the evening of Wednesday, the twenty-ninth_\r\n                        _of June_\r\n            _one thousand nine hundred and twelve_\r\n                _from eight until ten o'clock_\r\n                      _17 Elm Hill Avenue_\r\n                   _Philadelphia, Pennsylvania_\r\n        _R. s. v. p._\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Dr. and Mrs. Maurice Howe Cavanaugh_\r\n                   _request the honour of_\r\n\r\n        _presence at the marriage of their daughter_\r\n                     _Rebecca Falmouth_\r\n                           _to_\r\n               _Mr. Charles Hunnewell Clark_\r\n               _on Monday, the ninth of July_\r\n                     _at eight o'clock_\r\n                 _Church of the Redeemer_\r\n                       _Washington_\r\n\r\nThe usual form of marriage announcement is as follows:\r\n\r\n           _Mr. and Mrs. William T. Kimball_\r\n        _announce the marriage of their daughter_\r\n                  _Dorothy Lucinda_\r\n                          _to_\r\n                 _Mr. LeRoy L. Hallock_\r\n        _on Wednesday, the first day of December_\r\n          _one thousand nine hundred and twelve_\r\n                   _Chicago, Illinois_\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Mr. Arthur Edmand Sawyer_\r\n                      _and_\r\n           _Miss Emma Pauline Farrington_\r\n            _announce their marriage_\r\n         _on Sunday the sixteenth of July_\r\n        _one thousand nine hundred and ten_\r\n             _at Boston, Massachusetts_\r\n\r\nThe \"At Home\" card of the bridal couple, which goes with a wedding\r\ninvitation, does not have the name of the couple upon it, but reads\r\nsimply\r\n\r\n                _At Home_\r\n        _after the first of November_\r\n          _1219 Pennsylvania Avenue_\r\n               _Washington_\r\n\r\nWhen an \"At Home\" card is included in a wedding _announcement_,\r\nhowever, the name of the couple appears upon it, as follows:\r\n\r\n              _Mr. and Mrs. Albion Frederick Marston_\r\n\r\n            _Will be at home_           _763 Chapel Avenue_\r\n        _after the first of August_         _Toronto_\r\n\r\nFor the card of invitation to the wedding reception the wording is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                  _Reception_\r\n        _immediately after the ceremony_\r\n              _Eight Salem Street_\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n                 _Reception_\r\n        _immediately after the ceremony_\r\n            _in the church parlors_\r\n\r\nIn the case of a church wedding, it is always well to enclose with the\r\ninvitation a small card reading: \"Please present this card at the\r\nchurch on August the third.\"\r\n\r\nIn case the wedding takes place in the country and invitations are\r\nsent to many friends in the city, a card giving directions as to what\r\ntrain to take, and where, which is to be presented to the conductor\r\ninstead of a ticket, and which entitles the possessor to special\r\naccommodations, is enclosed with the invitation.\r\n\r\nWedding invitations, or announcements, and their accompanying cards,\r\nare enclosed in two envelopes, one within the other, of the same\r\nstock as the billets. Upon the outer is written the name of the person\r\nand his street address; upon the inner only the name of the one for\r\nwhom it is intended.\r\n\r\nWedding invitations should be addressed to \"Mrs. Chandler Jones,\" on\r\nthe outside envelope. Within this is a second envelope addressed to\r\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Jones.\" The older custom is to address the\r\noutside envelope to \"Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Jones,\" as well as the\r\ninside. The lady of the house is now, however, beginning to be looked\r\nupon as head of its social affairs, as her husband is of its business\r\naffairs, and hence the style of addressing invitations to her.\r\n\r\nThe words \"And Family\" are no longer used after the parents' names,\r\nbut separate invitations are sent to the members.\r\n\r\nIt is quite the courteous thing to include among the people invited to\r\na wedding, especially if it is to be in a church, the special business\r\nfriends and associates of the bridegroom-elect, his father, and the\r\nbride's father.\r\n\r\nIn case the invitations are for the ceremony only at a church wedding,\r\nthe address of the bride's parents should be embossed upon the outside\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\nAcquaintances purely professional do not receive cards to a wedding.\r\nOne's physician, however, if his family is prominent socially, may be\r\nincluded among the guests.\r\n\r\nAnnouncement cards should be quite ready to post immediately after the\r\nceremony. They should be sent to all the circle of friends and\r\nacquaintances of both the bride's and the bridegroom's families, save\r\nto those who have been invited to the marriage or the wedding\r\nreception.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of an \"At Home\" or reception should always be made on\r\na separate card,--not on a corner of the wedding invitation or\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\nAn immediate reply is necessary when one is invited to a home wedding.\r\nIf the wedding is a church wedding, and there is no reception\r\nfollowing it, one makes no reply if one intends to be present, but\r\nsends one's card upon the date set, if one cannot attend.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Various Announcement Cards_\r\n\r\nIn case of the postponement of a wedding or a dinner or reception\r\nbecause of some grave accident or illness, the cancellation of the\r\ninvitations, or the announcement of the postponement, should be\r\nengraved and sent out at the earliest possible date.\r\n\r\nFor a wedding it may read somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n                _Mr. and Mrs. Maynard S. Taylor_\r\n                      _regret to announce_\r\n        _that on account of serious illness in the family_\r\n               _the marriage of their daughter_\r\n               _Emmeline and Mr. Fosdick Arlington_\r\n                _will be indefinitely postponed_\r\n\r\nA family which has passed through a period of calamity and bereavement\r\nmay wish to make some acknowledgment of the attentions of friends, and\r\nmay do so in some such form as follows:\r\n\r\n          _The brothers and sisters of_\r\n            _Dr. Ralph J. Harkins_\r\n            _gratefully acknowledge_\r\n        _your kind expression of sympathy_\r\n\r\nThe special \"At Home\" card which is used for a reception in honor of a\r\nfriend or guest may contain the name of the friend either on the first\r\nor the last line of the invitation, with the words \"To meet\" before\r\nit; as:\r\n\r\n              _Mrs. Ernest L. Lafricain_\r\n                       _At Home_\r\n           _Thursday, December twenty-third_\r\n                   _from four to six_\r\n            _275 Grand Pre Avenue, Montreal_\r\n        _To meet Mrs. Jackson Seymour Montgomery_\r\n\r\nFor a general reception the following form is good:\r\n\r\n            _Mr. and Mrs. Henry Illington Bray_\r\n                _Mr. and Mrs. Harold Bray_\r\n           _request the honor of your presence_\r\n                   _on New Year's Day_\r\n        _from four until half after seven o'clock_\r\n                 _174 Albemarle Street_\r\n                        _Winnipeg_\r\n\r\nThe private engraved card for Christmas and New Year greetings, which\r\nmay be sent to one's entire list of friends, is much in favor. Great\r\ndistinction and individuality of design and selection of sentiment may\r\nbe obtained by this means. The following is an appropriate form:\r\n\r\n                              \"_The glory breaks\r\n        And Christmas comes once more_\"\r\n\r\n        _Mr. and Mrs. Nathaniel Clarke Sutherland\r\n                   cordially greet_\r\n\r\n          _with every good wish of the Season_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nBEHAVIOR IN PUBLIC\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE test of the depth of one's courtesy is found in one's attitude to\r\nstrangers and the public at large. If one observes toward them the\r\nlittle courtesies, then one may be safely trusted to keep to the\r\nhighest ideal of social intercourse in times of emergency and rigid\r\ntesting.\r\n\r\nAlways in a public place the real gentleman and lady will be\r\nunobtrusive, speaking quietly, and showing in their manner that they\r\neach believe himself and herself but a single unit in the world of\r\nhumanity, and therefore not entitled to monopolize attention. They\r\nwill go about their business with none of that idle curiosity which\r\nforms the street crowd.\r\n\r\nIn places of public amusement, they will show true courtesy by not\r\ncoming in late,--that is, by being on time or missing the performance.\r\nThey will not rustle their programs needlessly. They will so dispose\r\nof their coats and wraps that others will not be inconvenienced by\r\nthem, even if it takes them an extra ten minutes at the close of the\r\nevening to obtain them from the cloak room.\r\n\r\nThey will not talk or whisper to each other during speaking or singing\r\non the stage, or at any time when so doing will make it difficult for\r\nothers to hear what is going on. They will applaud temperately, and\r\nwith only that degree of fervor which is for the best interests of the\r\naudience and the actors as a whole. That is, at a concert they will\r\nnot so applaud one artist as to break up the program.\r\n\r\nAt formal business meetings they will take pains to conform to\r\nParliamentary usage, which is really only the etiquette of debate, and\r\nwill not insist upon rights which have been ruled out, or in word or\r\nmanner express a disorderly spirit. \"The greatest good of the largest\r\nnumber\" will be the rule of their deportment in public.\r\n\r\nAt a social occasion of any sort, every one present is under\r\nobligation to do what he can to add to the general pleasure. If he\r\ncannot or will not, he should remain away. If he is asked to play a\r\nmusical instrument or sing, he should do so without urging, for his\r\ntalents, except in very special cases wherein he would not be asked,\r\nare or should be at the disposal of the company, or at the request of\r\nhis hostess. Any voluntary or requested performance of this sort may\r\nbe as brief as he pleases, and should be brief, unless his talent is\r\nso great that there can be no possible doubt of its acceptability, and\r\nhe is in a generous mood,--a combination of circumstances rare in any\r\nbut the most talented circles.\r\n\r\nIf you turn the pages of music for a musician, do so in a quiet and\r\nself-forgetful manner. Interest in you is quite subordinate to\r\ninterest in the performer.\r\n\r\nDo not by extravagant applause encourage parlor recitations, for\r\nmediocre talent is always profuse.\r\n\r\nIt is a mark of good breeding to control or at least conceal one's\r\nmoods, so that in company one always appears to be content, if not\r\nhappy. It adds much to the happiness of others to give this\r\nimpression, and is therefore generous as well as wise.\r\n\r\nIt is always rude to interrupt with conversation, or yawning, or any\r\nmotion, a musical performance, or any entertainment whether public or\r\nprivate, in which those about one are interested. One should retire if\r\nhe cannot refrain.\r\n\r\nBehavior in church may be taught in one great principle, providing\r\nthat principle is fundamental enough. The sense of reverence for the\r\nthings of the spiritual life may be felt, if not comprehended, by even\r\nthe child. No amount of \"Don't's,\" if the spirit of worship be not\r\ninstilled, will avail to make the child of any age an attentive and\r\nreverent worshiper or even attendant at church.\r\n\r\nThe sense of worship will forbid whispering and chatting with friends,\r\nthe noisy turning of the leaves of hymn-book or Bible, or an\r\nindifferent or scornful attitude when any are in prayer.\r\n\r\nAnother sign of the same reverence is the careful observance of\r\npunctuality at the service. A church service is, by its very nature, a\r\nmore intimate and important service to the attendant than any other.\r\nTherefore, to come in late, thus distracting the attention of those\r\nwho have gone to church for meditation or worship, is a far more\r\nflagrant offense against the rights of others, than is the disturbing\r\nof their pleasure at a theatre or a concert by a tardy entrance.\r\n\r\nThe habit of a vacant or absent mind in company is a grave fault, and\r\nworks greatly to the detriment of one's reputation for intelligence,\r\nin spite of all else that one may do to establish it.\r\n\r\nStraightforward attentiveness is the attitude of most profit and\r\nenjoyment in society. One learns then what other people are thinking\r\nabout, and becomes more and more active mentally. Such an attitude\r\nestablishes the confidence of others in one's sincerity and\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nInquisitiveness is fatal to real charm. No one cares to talk twice\r\nwith a person who, no matter what his wit or ability to entertain, has\r\nbetrayed one into divulging facts or making remarks which he regrets.\r\n\r\nUpon the street a gentleman always takes the outside of the walk, when\r\nwith a lady, the custom having come down from the days when dangers\r\nbeset the path, and the man had to be at the point of vantage for the\r\nprotection of the woman.\r\n\r\nWhen a married woman and an unmarried girl are walking together, the\r\nmarried woman takes the outside of the walk.\r\n\r\nIn passing single file other people or some obstacle, the gentleman\r\nalways steps back and allows the lady to precede him. If, however, the\r\nway is crowded or there is necessity that she should be protected, he\r\ngoes first.\r\n\r\nIn entering a hotel dining-room the lady always goes first.\r\n\r\nA lady never takes a gentleman's arm unless she is blind, infirm, or\r\ncrippled, or in a turbulent crowd.\r\n\r\nThe considerate person will not enter even a public hotel late at\r\nnight, much less a home, his own or any other, in a noisy, careless\r\nfashion. Those who are asleep deserve as great consideration as if\r\nthey were awake, and more also.\r\n\r\nThe modern courtesy of letting each one pay for himself in a car, a\r\ntrain, a restaurant, or a theatre, is a much more rational one than\r\nthe older form of permitting one to act as host, as if he were in his\r\nown house. A gentleman might offer to pay for others, if he wished to,\r\nbut he should not insist upon paying; nor should any one carelessly or\r\ndesignedly permit his expenses to be paid by another, unless he\r\nhimself expects to offer equal hospitality at another time.\r\n\r\nIn entering a carriage or automobile, one should step promptly,\r\nwithout either loitering or haste. If one is to sit facing the horses\r\nor the front of the automobile, and there is but one step to take, one\r\nputs the left foot on it. If there are two steps, the right foot\r\nshould take the first, the left the second. If one is to face in the\r\nopposite direction from what the vehicle is going, one should use the\r\nright foot first in case of the one step, and the left foot first in\r\ncase of the two.\r\n\r\nWhen two ladies who are guest and hostess are driving together, the\r\nguest should enter first, taking the farther seat, facing the front of\r\nthe carriage, so that it will not be necessary for her hostess to pass\r\nher. When a mother and daughter enter a carriage, the mother precedes,\r\nand the daughter sits by her side if no other lady is present. In case\r\nof two daughters, the elder sits by the side of the mother, and the\r\nyounger sits opposite.\r\n\r\nThe fashionable hours for driving are from two-thirty to five in the\r\nwinter, and from three to six-thirty in the summer.\r\n\r\nYoung women never ride horseback in cities or in public parks without\r\nan escort. In the country the rule is not so rigidly enforced. In case\r\na groom is the escort, he rides slightly behind, keeping watch that he\r\nmay be of service.\r\n\r\nA riding-habit should be absolutely neat, simple, and inconspicuous.\r\nThe hat should be plain, the hair compactly done, and the whole effect\r\nof the costume trim serviceableness and grace, rather than prettiness.\r\n\r\nIn mounting a horse a woman gathers up her habit in her left hand, and\r\nstands close to the horse with her right hand on the pommel of the\r\nsaddle. The man who assists her stoops and places his right hand with\r\nthe palm up at a convenient distance from the ground. The lady then\r\nputs her left foot into his hand, and springs up into the saddle with\r\nhis assistance.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, first, to have a firm seat; secondly, a skillful hand\r\non the rein. One should sit in the middle of the saddle, in an easy,\r\nnatural position, with the body not stiff but supple and responsive to\r\nthe motion of the horse. The elbows should be well in to the side, in\r\na line with the shoulders, and the hands should be relaxed and yet\r\nresponsive to the slightest pull of the rein.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer considered wise and necessary for a woman to use a\r\nside saddle. In the freedom of a graceful divided skirt, she strides\r\nthe saddle as do the men, and therefore has an equal chance with them\r\nto ride gracefully and safely,--a privilege which fashion long denied.\r\n\r\nTo keep to the right always is the only safe rule in the United\r\nStates. In England and Canada the rule of keeping to the left is\r\nobserved with the same rigidity.\r\n\r\nIn business life it is not good form to dine with your employer. This\r\ndoes not include a ban upon those business dinners, where there is a\r\ngroup of people, the majority of them men, with one or two unmarried\r\nbusiness women of equal or superior business standing, who meet over\r\nthe dinner table to talk of business problems. That occasion has its\r\nown etiquette, and one which the business man or woman readily\r\nfashions for himself or herself, and which follows the rules of\r\nbusiness expediency rather than social life.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to recognize in society a strictly business\r\nacquaintance unless you wish to do so.\r\n\r\nNeatness demands that the traveler always carry his own toilet\r\narticles, and not depend upon the public supplies, which are,\r\nhowever, supposedly safe and sanitary for use in emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe dress for traveling should be plain and simple, suited to the need\r\nrather than elaborate. The effect of crumpled finery is so very\r\nunpleasant that no person of taste will make a display of it in a\r\npublic conveyance.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to leave your seat in a train, a coat or bag placed upon\r\nit is sufficient to reserve it for you. The removal of a coat or bag\r\nso placed is a very great rudeness.\r\n\r\nA gentleman will give up his seat to two ladies, or to a gentleman and\r\nlady traveling together, as he can be more readily accommodated in the\r\nsingle seats than can they.\r\n\r\nIt is courteous for a gentleman who has a vacant place in the seat\r\nwith him to offer it to a lady who is standing, and so prevent her\r\nfrom feeling that she is intruding in taking it, if there are no other\r\nseats vacant.\r\n\r\nWhen a man opens a door for a woman who is a stranger, or offers her\r\nany other civility, or begs pardon for some blunder, he takes off his\r\nhat to her.\r\n\r\nWhile traveling alone, it is not necessary or wise to be resentful of\r\npolite remarks or attentions. They should be met with equal\r\npoliteness. Quiet dignity and tact will terminate without offense any\r\nconversation which has grown too familiar or tedious.\r\n\r\nThe comfort of all in the car, not of one individual, should be\r\nconsulted in the opening of windows and doors, and the consent of\r\nthose sitting near should be gained.\r\n\r\nIt is a grave breach of good manners to monopolize a dressing-room for\r\nquite a period of time. One should be as expeditious as possible, and\r\nshould not seriously inconvenience others, even if he deprives himself\r\nof some of the comfort he desires.\r\n\r\nIt is not well to travel unless you can afford it. If you can and do\r\ntravel, deal courteously and generously with those who serve you.\r\n\r\nAsk questions only of officials of the road or the ship, or of\r\npolicemen in the street.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of visiting cards with strangers, unless under unusual\r\ncircumstances, is unwise and bad form.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily a lady pays her fare herself, unless she is under escort of\r\na relative or intimate friend to whom she gives the right to pay for\r\nher. When she enters a car alone and there meets an acquaintance, she\r\nalways pays her own fare, unless the acquaintance may be an old and\r\nintimate friend.\r\n\r\nWhen a lady is taking a long trip under escort of some gentleman\r\nfriend, it is proper for her to reimburse him for his expenditures in\r\nher behalf. She should hand him her purse with which to purchase her\r\nticket.\r\n\r\nThe munching of nuts, fruit, or candy in a crowded public conveyance\r\nis a serious offense against those about you. A neat lunch, quietly\r\neaten at an appropriate hour, is not offensive and is quite\r\npermissible. But one should not impose even the odor of food upon\r\npeople who are forced to be near, and who may find it extremely\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\nThe recent passage and enforcement of laws regarding expectoration in\r\npublic places is a great step in advance, and must be rigidly\r\nmaintained for the sake of the public health. The chewing of gum,\r\nwhile no menace to society, is as unesthetic and disgusting as\r\nexpectoration, and should fall under as righteous if not as severe a\r\nban.\r\n\r\nIn a car or train do not fan yourself so vigorously that the person in\r\nfront of you feels the air current upon the back of his neck. A book\r\nor newspaper should not be placed so that it rubs constantly against\r\nthe hat of the person in the seat in front.\r\n\r\nPushing, shoving, and all like methods of getting people to move out\r\nof your way, or of getting ahead of others, are marks of great\r\nrudeness, and have a tendency to retard rather than aid one's progress\r\nthrough a crowd or into a car. The quiet, good-natured crowd disperses\r\nmost rapidly.\r\n\r\nAt the ferry and all prepayment places, have the right change in\r\nhand, so that you do not keep back those who are in a rush to catch a\r\nboat or a car, by fumbling for your money or making the receiver make\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nDo not carry an umbrella carelessly. You are as culpable if you injure\r\nanother as another would be if he injured you.\r\n\r\nTo converse in loud tones or talk of personal matters anywhere in\r\npublic shows great lack of fine feeling and good breeding.\r\n\r\nNever show hostility, nor permit people to quarrel with you. The\r\nirritability which crowded conditions aggravate makes it necessary to\r\nadhere, from principle, to the rule of strict good-will toward all.\r\n\r\nIf you are escorting a woman, do not permit her to suffer any\r\ndiscomfort; but if, by chance, she does, do not pick a quarrel with\r\nthe person who caused it. Firmly but quietly afford her protection,\r\nbut do not demand satisfaction for discomforts or insults for which\r\nthere is no satisfaction and whose discussion only increases the\r\noffense.\r\n\r\nA lady need feel no embarrassment if she is obliged to spend a few\r\ndays in a hotel alone. Upon entering she would go to the desk and make\r\narrangements for a room. When the choice is made she surrenders her\r\nhand bag to the bell-boy, who conducts her to her room. She should,\r\nfor her own convenience and protection, deposit valuables or large\r\nsums of money with the hotel proprietor in the office safe. Then the\r\nresponsibility becomes his, but he does not assume it if they are left\r\nin the room. Upon leaving her room, she should lock her trunks and\r\ndoor, and leave the key with the clerk at the desk.\r\n\r\nA lady's deportment in a hotel is that of quiet reserve, but not of\r\nhaughty distance. She should dress simply and plainly, so as not to\r\nattract attention, as she is in a public place. The only time when\r\nelegant dress is permissible at a hotel is when one is with an escort,\r\nor is one of a group of people so dressed in order to attend some\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nA lady will not stand or linger in the halls of a hotel, will not\r\nloiter about the hotel office, or walk out alone upon the piazza or\r\nany conspicuous place, or stand at the windows of the parlor. She will\r\nremember that she is in a public place, where she may encounter all\r\nclasses of people, so she will not permit herself any of the liberties\r\nof a home. She will not go through the halls humming or singing, or\r\ntake a book or newspaper from the public parlor and carry it off to\r\nher room, even if she does shortly return it. She will not, even in\r\nher own room, make such noise as will attract attention or disturb\r\nother guests.\r\n\r\nShe will not call a cab herself, but will summon a bell-boy and have\r\nhim attend to it. After her baggage is packed she will let the\r\nservants attend to it, even to the handing her of her umbrella and\r\nhand bag after she is in the carriage. She will never take the liberty\r\nof chiding a servant, but will make a necessary complaint to the clerk\r\nat the desk.\r\n\r\nTo open a window in the parlor of a hotel, when others are by and may\r\nbe discomforted, is a breach of politeness. Also it is not right that\r\neven an accomplished musician or singer should use the piano of the\r\nhotel parlor, if others are in the room, unless he has received a\r\nunanimous invitation to do so.\r\n\r\nOne may greet fellow guests in the parlor or the dining-room without\r\nbeing thought forward or intrusive, and also may respond to such\r\ngreetings without compromise, as such acquaintance does not imply or\r\ndemand recognition elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA lady, when alone at a hotel dining table, will decide quickly what\r\ndishes she wishes, and order them distinctly but quietly. She will\r\nwait patiently to be served, without any display of embarrassment. It\r\nis allowable to read a newspaper while waiting for breakfast, but not\r\ngood taste to bring books to the table at any time. If she desires a\r\ndish which she sees, but the name of which she does not know, she will\r\nnot point to it, but will indicate it to the waiter by her glance and\r\nher description.\r\n\r\nIf she has friends or makes table acquaintances, she will talk with\r\nthem in a low tone. She will never talk with some one at another\r\ntable, nor laugh loudly. If any civility, such as the passing of food,\r\nis offered her by either a lady or a gentleman, she will express her\r\nthanks, but will not start a conversation.\r\n\r\nThe usual good manners of cultivated people, emphasized by the\r\nadditional restraint which the presence of the public imposes, is a\r\nsafe standard of etiquette in a hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF BEING A GUEST\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST as the host and hostess, in sending out an invitation, obligate\r\nthemselves to make everything as enjoyable as possible for their\r\nguest, so a guest, in accepting, obligates himself or herself to meet\r\nthe efforts of the host and hostess at least halfway. Success in the\r\nart of being a guest depends more upon the spirit in which one accepts\r\nof entertainment than upon the entertainment offered.\r\n\r\nA formal dinner is one of the most solemn obligations of society.\r\nAfter having once accepted the invitation, only death or mortal\r\nillness is an excuse for not attending.\r\n\r\nOne may attend a formal reception and not expend more than twenty\r\nminutes of time, if one wishes to be very prompt. The round of social\r\nduty there is brief. A lady removes her wrap, but not her hat or\r\ngloves, in the dressing-room, and thence goes directly to the\r\ndrawing-room. The guest here greets the host and hostess, briefly if\r\nthe reception is large and the flow of incoming guests constant, then\r\npasses to the room where the refreshments are served. After partaking\r\nof these, the guest may leave without bidding adieu to the hostess,\r\nunless the reception is small and she is free to speak a second time\r\nwith her guests.\r\n\r\nIf one is present at an afternoon tea or reception, it is not always\r\nnecessary to call afterwards; yet, many hostesses expect such a call\r\nif the affair has been formal. One should certainly call after a tea\r\ngiven to introduce a debutante, or a wedding reception, or one given\r\nin honor of some special person or event.\r\n\r\nIf a guest is not pleased with the food provided at a luncheon or\r\ndinner, or for any special reason cannot eat of any one dish, he\r\nshould try and satisfy himself with something else, and make no\r\ncomment upon it, doing his utmost to prevent his hostess from thinking\r\nthat she has not well provided for him.\r\n\r\nAt a dancing party a young man should assist his hostess in seeing\r\nthat all the young ladies have an equal chance to dance, and that none\r\nare obliged to sit out dances because of a dearth of partners. His\r\nobligation to his hostess and to society should be thus honored, as it\r\nis not, of course, a private affair for his own amusement, and as upon\r\nhim, more than upon the young women, depends its success.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that introductions be freely made at a dancing party,\r\nin order that all may enjoy the evening, and every one should try to\r\nmake all his friends acquainted with each other.\r\n\r\nA young woman remains seated by the side of her chaperon until asked\r\nto dance. After a dance her partner returns with her to the chaperon.\r\n\r\nIf the son of the hostess requests a dance of a young woman, she\r\nshould give it unless her program is quite full. If for any reason she\r\nrefuses a dance to one man, she should not give it to another, but\r\nshould sit it out. A woman, having once promised a dance, should\r\nfulfill her promise unless too ill to do so, in which case she will\r\ndance no more during the evening. The young man who is thus refused is\r\nfree, having returned with her to her chaperon, to seek another\r\npartner.\r\n\r\nUnless a young couple are engaged to each other, they should not dance\r\ntogether so often as to be conspicuous. Nor may they disappear into\r\nsecluded corners and sit out dances. It is poor taste and very\r\nquestionable etiquette, even if engaged.\r\n\r\nWhen asked to dance, a woman hands the man her program, saying, \"I am\r\nnot engaged for that dance, and will be pleased to give it to you.\"\r\nAfter the dance the man may thank the woman for it, and she may make\r\nsome remark to express her pleasure in it.\r\n\r\nIf a man is delayed in claiming a woman for the promised dance, he\r\nshould make profuse apologies.\r\n\r\nA man dances first with the woman he escorts, or with the daughters of\r\nthe hostess, or her guests in the house. Afterward he may choose for\r\nhimself, always remembering that he should assist his hostess in\r\ngiving a good time to all.\r\n\r\nA woman always makes the first move toward going home at every social\r\ngathering. At a dance it is not necessary to say good-night to the\r\nhostess unless there is a good opportunity.\r\n\r\nIf a man is suddenly called away, he should try to find partners for\r\nthe ladies with whom he engaged dances, and should explain his leaving\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nIt is not obligatory, but simply a pleasant custom, for a man to send\r\nflowers to the young woman whom he is going to escort to a dancing\r\nparty. When she is his fiancee, it is especially appropriate and\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nWhen one is on a visit, or at a house or weekend party, one has to\r\nfollow the style of dress of the people whom one is visiting, so no\r\nhard and fast rules can be laid down. One should have suitable\r\ngarments for each of the forms of recreation which one is to enjoy,\r\nand should follow quite closely the requirements of the hour.\r\n\r\nWhen traveling, small, plain hats and tidily draped veils are\r\nnecessary. For mountain visits, thicker clothing and heavier wraps\r\nwill be in demand, than are used in the city. When it is the custom to\r\ndress for dinner, one should always adhere to it, and so plan one's\r\nhours that nothing interferes with so doing and being prompt as well.\r\n\r\nA guest should not claim the entire time of her hostess. The hours\r\nbetween breakfast and lunch belong to the hostess for the doing of her\r\nhousehold and family duties, and the guest should entertain herself\r\nduring them.\r\n\r\nNo guest should ever accept an invitation to an entertainment, a\r\ndrive, or any other amusement without first consulting with her\r\nhostess. If, having friends in the same city or town, she has\r\ninvitations from them for special occasions, she should inform her\r\nhostess of them promptly, that two plans may not be made for the same\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nUnless a guest is ill or very old and feeble, she never suggests\r\nretiring. That is the duty of the hostess.\r\n\r\nA guest should take pains to arrive when expected. If she has promised\r\na visit, she should keep her promise, unless matters of serious\r\nillness or grave moment forbid it, in which case a prompt and\r\nexplanatory apology is imperative.\r\n\r\nThe guest should decide with her hostess, early in her stay, upon the\r\ndate of her departure, if that has not been already settled in the\r\nform of the invitation, and should then abide rigidly by it, allowing\r\nnothing but the most earnest importunity on the part of her hostess\r\npersonally, and for clearly shown and newly arising reasons, to detain\r\nher longer.\r\n\r\nThe guest should be pleased and well entertained with everything that\r\nis done for her amusement, or should appear to be so. If she cannot\r\ngive herself up to the enjoyment of the sort of entertainment which\r\nher host and hostess provide, she should not accept the invitation to\r\nvisit them.\r\n\r\nThe guest should be punctual at meals and conform in every particular\r\nto the ways of the household. She should not arrive in the living-room\r\nor drawing-room at hours when there will be none to entertain her, and\r\nwhen it would embarrass her hostess to know that she was unattended.\r\nTo sit up after the family has gone to bed, to lie in bed after the\r\nentire family have risen, to be late at meals, to be writing an\r\nimportant letter or doing some mending when the carriage is at the\r\ndoor for a drive, or wish to go to drive when the carriage has been\r\ndismissed, to be too tired to attend the dinner or reception given in\r\none's honor, to fail to keep appointments for the stroll or some sport\r\nbecause one wants to do something else,--these things show a total\r\nlack of consideration on the part of the guest, and make it\r\nimpossible to enjoy her stay or wish for her return.\r\n\r\nAt times which seem appropriate it is well to retire to one's room and\r\nleave the family by themselves. It is not necessary for the family\r\nlife and comfort to be sacrificed constantly to the guest. Hospitality\r\nwould be more generously shown if it did not make so many unnecessary\r\ndemands upon the time and comfort of the members of the family.\r\n\r\nThe guest should never take sides in any family discussion, and if\r\nanything unpleasant occurs, she should ignore it entirely, and not\r\nseem to know anything about it or take any interest in it.\r\n\r\nIt is an unpardonable breach of loyalty to one's hosts to retail any\r\ninformation one may have acquired on a visit, or discuss their\r\ncharacteristics and management with any one.\r\n\r\nA guest need not attend religious services, or be present at the calls\r\nof commonplace people, or enter into local philanthropies, unless he\r\nwishes to do so. True hospitality relieves him from all sense of\r\nobligation in these matters. If, however, carriages are provided so\r\nthat guests may attend church, or guests are told of the hour for\r\nfamily worship and are invited to be present, it is more courteous to\r\nattend.\r\n\r\nGuests at country houses should be willing to take hold and help in\r\nany emergency, such as the absence or sickness of the servants, and\r\nshould be willing to join heartily in the country frolics where work\r\nis usually to be shared by all.\r\n\r\nIn the country people visit in large parties, so when one is invited\r\nto go on an excursion or with a crowd to visit some neighbor, one\r\nshould not hesitate for fear of being one too many.\r\n\r\nOne should follow the wish of the host or hostess in regard to giving\r\nthe servants some gratuity for service rendered, if that wish is\r\nknown; otherwise, unless there is an accepted rule to the contrary, it\r\nis well to give, when leaving, a small gift of money to such of the\r\nservants as have been especially helpful. One should always treat\r\nservants with consideration and kindness, if not with generosity. It\r\nis better to be less lavish with money and more painstaking in\r\nremembering personally the people who have served you, renewing\r\nacquaintance with them if opportunity offers, treating them in a human\r\nway, and not with the indifference with which you would treat a\r\nmechanism.\r\n\r\nIf a gift is given, it should be done unostentatiously. The tactful,\r\nquiet way of doing it, free from patronage, and showing only good-will\r\nand gratitude for service rendered, is the only polite way. Money\r\nnever compensates for haughtiness and brusqueness, and the gentleman\r\nor lady in spirit will not be unmindful of the feelings of even an\r\nincompetent servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE DUTIES OF HOST AND HOSTESS\r\n\r\n\r\nHOSPITALITY is a great pleasure to people of a sociable nature, and\r\nits obligations have a most refining influence. The generous\r\nconsideration of others reaches its acme when one is constantly\r\nentertaining little circles of friends, with no thought but to give\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant custom of serving tea each day at five o'clock is one\r\nwhich admits of great enjoyment. The man of the house tries to be at\r\nhome for the quiet social hour before the family dinner. The young\r\npeople of the family are gathering after the day's dispersion. The\r\nfriends, who are out calling or on their way home, drop in for a\r\npleasant chat; and the charming hostess has time for many glimpses of\r\nfriends, and chance also to say the right word to some friend in need\r\nof cheer, who knew that she could be found at her daily hour of\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nThe custom of receiving on a certain day of the week is a sensible and\r\nhospitable one. If one has such an \"At Home\" day, it is more polite\r\nfor friends to call on that day than on any other. If a lady has,\r\nhowever, sent out cards announcing that she is \"At Home\" on\r\n\"Wednesdays in January and February,\" one should not call on those\r\ndays unless one has received the card having the special invitation.\r\n\r\nSome receive once a month during the season. They have the day\r\nengraved on their card, as \"The first Friday until Lent,\" or \"The\r\nsecond Wednesday until April.\"\r\n\r\nThe custom of sending out cards for a certain day throughout one month\r\navoids a \"crush\" on any one day, and enables a hostess to receive\r\ninformally without giving up a great part of her time.\r\n\r\nThe informal entertainment is a greater compliment to guests than any\r\nformal entertainment, however splendid.\r\n\r\nThe hostess should preserve the happy medium between neglecting and\r\noverattending to her guests.\r\n\r\nWhen a hostess wishes to have her friends meet an expected guest, she\r\nshould inform them of the intended visit beforehand, and so enable\r\nthem to make an engagement to meet her, or plan entertainment for her.\r\nInvitations to a reception in honor of a friend can well be, and\r\nshould be, sent out in advance of her coming, if her stay is to be\r\nshort, and if the dates of her stay are definitely known.\r\n\r\nAt a reception for the introduction of a friend, the hostess and the\r\nguest of honor will stand near the door of the drawing-room and\r\nreceive. If the reception is very large, the butler announces the\r\nnames of the guests as they enter. The hostess gives her hand to the\r\nnewcomer, and presents her to the guest of honor. After a few words of\r\ngreeting, the caller passes on into the room where the refreshments\r\nare served.\r\n\r\nThe refreshments usually consist of dainty sandwiches, salads, perhaps\r\ncreamed oysters or chicken, bouillon, chocolate, coffee, or lemonade.\r\n\r\nAfternoon teas are less formal and less elaborate than receptions. The\r\nrefreshments consist of tea, with thin slices of bread and butter,\r\nthin biscuits, and cake.\r\n\r\nAt a dancing party the hostess receives, together with her daughters\r\nand any guests whom she honors by asking. The host may receive, as\r\nwell, but his chief duty is to keep a watchful eye upon his guests,\r\nlooking out for the chaperons, and seeing that the young people are\r\nsupplied with partners for the dances.\r\n\r\nAt a debutante party the mother stands nearest the drawing-room door,\r\nthe daughter next her, and the father beyond. The mother greets each\r\nguest and then introduces the daughter. At the supper or dinner her\r\nbrother or father takes out the debutante, who sits at her father's\r\nleft. In case her brother takes her out, her father takes out the\r\noldest or most honored lady present.\r\n\r\nThe successful host and hostess see to it that all their guests are\r\nintroduced to each other, if this is possible, so that the best of\r\ncordiality and the least restraint may characterize their mingling.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Breakfasts and Luncheons_\r\n\r\nBreakfasts may be homelike, informal affairs, or quite ceremonious.\r\nThe hour of this meal is at any time before one o'clock, usually\r\ntwelve or twelve-thirty. After one o'clock the affair becomes a\r\nluncheon.\r\n\r\nMen are invited to a breakfast, but usually at a luncheon the guests\r\nare all women.\r\n\r\nA real breakfast menu, such as is often served on Sunday mornings in\r\nthe country, consists of fruit, cereal, a chop, or steak, or\r\nfishballs, with potatoes, eggs in some form, muffins or hot rolls, and\r\ncoffee, waffles or hot cakes, or, in New England, doughnuts.\r\n\r\nThe menu for luncheon consists usually of soup, fruit, lobster in\r\ncutlets or croquettes, with mushrooms, or omelet, or fish; broiled\r\nchicken, or lamb chops, with green peas and potatoes; a salad,\r\ncrackers and cheese; ice cream, with coffee, tea, or chocolate.\r\n\r\nAt a breakfast or luncheon, as at a dinner, every effort should be\r\nmade to be punctual. The success of such an occasion may be ruined by\r\na tardy guest.\r\n\r\nAt a luncheon one removes wraps and veils in the dressing-room,\r\nretaining one's hat and gloves, the latter being removed at table, and\r\nresumed in the drawing-room after the meal, unless cards are the form\r\nof entertainment.\r\n\r\nAs the guests enter the drawing-room the hostess shakes hands with\r\nthem and introduces them to one another before going to the\r\ndining-room. When no men are present the hostess leads the way to the\r\ndining-room, and the guests find their places at the table by the name\r\ncards. When men are present the procedure to the dining-room follows\r\nthe custom at a formal dinner.\r\n\r\nIt is becoming customary to use the daylight as much as possible at\r\nall social functions; and, indeed, at no affair, unless it be very\r\nlate in the afternoon and very ceremonious, is the daylight excluded\r\nand the candles and chandeliers lighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Formal Dinner_\r\n\r\nThe most enjoyable dinner is that with four or six guests, which is\r\nserved in a simple and only semiformal way. This enables a hostess to\r\nbring together only congenial people, and the group is small enough\r\nfor the talk to be largely general, and thence especially valuable, as\r\neach brings his wittiest stories, his clearest thoughts, and his best\r\nself to the appreciative and inspiring circle.\r\n\r\nThe formal dinner is usually set for seven o'clock, or half after, or\r\neight. The elaborate dinner will take from an hour to two hours,\r\naccording to the number of courses and the efficiency of the service.\r\nThere should be a waiter for every six people, although at a small\r\ndinner an efficient maid may serve eight covers without much delay.\r\n\r\nThe invitations to a formal dinner are sent out two weeks ahead. No\r\nmore people should be asked than can be comfortably seated and\r\nspeedily served. Twenty inches at the very least should be allowed to\r\neach cover. Children are never present at a ceremonious dinner.\r\n\r\nIn choosing guests every effort should be made to have them congenial,\r\nwith no glaring divergence of opinions, which would by any means make\r\nany one uncomfortable if the conversation were to become general. In\r\nseating the guests, only congenial people should be placed side by\r\nside. The intellectual harmony of a dinner is as important as the\r\nculinary harmony.\r\n\r\nLadies wear gloves at a formal dinner, and remove them only at table,\r\nresuming them when dinner is over and the guests have returned to the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room must be quietly but well lighted. There should be no\r\nglaring lights, but a soft radiance which is so general as to make\r\neverything clear. An electric light hanging eighteen inches above the\r\ntable, or a tall lamp whose light is at about the same height, either\r\nof them well shaded, are satisfactory additions to the candlelight.\r\n\r\nSometimes high lights are dispensed with and only candles used.\r\nCandles should always be lighted three minutes before the dinner is\r\nannounced. For a dinner of not more than eight covers four candles are\r\nsufficient light.\r\n\r\nRelatives are not seated side by side, as the effort is to have a\r\ngeneral mingling of the company. A clever hostess will see that her\r\nguests at a small dinner party are all introduced to each other before\r\nthey enter the dining-room.\r\n\r\nThe table may be round, oval, or rectangular, but if too narrow it\r\ncannot be made to look well.\r\n\r\nThe tablecloth is always spread for a dinner. A thick pad of felt or\r\ndouble-faced cotton flannel should go under the tablecloth. The damask\r\nshould be immaculate and of good quality. The tablecloth should hang\r\nalmost to the floor at the corners.\r\n\r\nAt each place there is a card on which the guest's name is written.\r\nThese place cards often have the monogram of the hostess in the center\r\nand are otherwise blank, except for the name written on.\r\n\r\nThe place cards at a dinner should be laid immediately before the\r\nplates of the guests or on the napkins, which are folded squarely, and\r\nof sufficient size to be of real usefulness.\r\n\r\nIn setting the table, the spoons for soup, dessert, and coffee are\r\narranged at the top of the plate; the knives and forks, the latter of\r\nseveral sizes, are placed on either hand, in order of use, and the\r\nsmall plate for bread, olives, etc., is on the right.\r\n\r\nIn eating, the oyster fork is the first used, and then one takes the\r\nnext in order. Should one be in doubt, the rule is to glance at the\r\nhostess and adopt her method, whatever that may be.\r\n\r\nOn elegant tables, each cover, or plate, is accompanied by two large\r\nsilver knives, a small silver knife, and fork for fish, a small fork\r\nfor oysters on the half-shell, a large tablespoon for soup, and three\r\nlarge forks. The folded napkin is laid in the center, with a piece of\r\nbread in it. Fish should be eaten with silver knife and fork.\r\n\r\nA half-ladleful of soup is quite enough for each person, unless at a\r\ncountry dinner, where a full ladleful may be given without offense.\r\n\r\nIndividual salts or salt cellars are now placed at each plate, and it\r\nis not improper to take salt with the tip of the knife in lieu of a\r\nspoon.\r\n\r\nThe place plates stand under the oyster or soup plates and under any\r\ncourse when it is desirable to have them. Plates must be warmed or\r\nchilled according to the temperature of the food which is to be served\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nThe indispensable courses of a dinner are soup, fish, roast, salad,\r\nand dessert. In arranging her menu, however, each hostess will suit\r\nherself to her pocketbook and to what she considers good form in the\r\namount and kind of food.\r\n\r\nThe formal dinner should be served in a very leisurely style.\r\n\r\nAt the daily family dinner as well as at formal dinners, all the\r\nladies of the house and among the guests should be helped before any\r\nof the men are served, even if some distinguished guest is among the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to wait until all are served before beginning to\r\neat at a dinner, but wait until the hostess has commenced to eat.\r\n\r\nButter is not served at a formal dinner, and bread is laid in the\r\nnapkin beside the plate.\r\n\r\nThere should be no urging of guests to eat. It is assumed that a guest\r\nis not afraid to eat as much as he wants.\r\n\r\nWhen the fruit napkin is brought in, the user takes it from the glass\r\nplate on which it is laid, and either places it at his right hand, or\r\non his knees. The doily beneath the finger bowl is not meant for use,\r\nbut should be laid on the table beside the finger bowl.\r\n\r\nAfter the dinner has been eaten, and dessert is reached, everything is\r\ncleared off but the tablecloth, which is now never removed. A dessert\r\nspoon is put before each guest, and a gold or silver spoon, a silver\r\ndessert spoon and fork, and often a queer little combination of fork\r\nand spoon called an ice spoon. For the after-dinner coffee a very\r\nsmall spoon is used.\r\n\r\nCoffee may be served in demi-tasse at the table, or later in the\r\ndrawing-room. Cream is never served with a demi-tasse.\r\n\r\nThe napkin should be left lying loosely beside the plate after a meal.\r\n\r\nIn case either a guest or a servant meets with any accident one should\r\npass it over with as much speed as possible and turn the attention of\r\nall immediately toward some interesting matter. A mistake should be\r\ncompletely ignored by both hosts and guests.\r\n\r\nWhenever a course is offered which you do not enjoy, never decline it,\r\nbut accept it, and endeavor to take a small portion at least of it.\r\nYou avoid then the tacit criticism of the taste of those who like it,\r\nand put your hostess at ease.\r\n\r\nNo personal preferences in foods are to be consulted or mentioned\r\nwhen one is a guest at dinner. If one cannot accept of the fare\r\noffered, one should have declined the invitation.\r\n\r\nShould a guest be late, the hostess need not wait more than fifteen\r\nminutes for him, after which time, if he appear, the host rises from\r\nthe table to greet him and cover the interruption of his entrance, but\r\nthe hostess does not leave her place. If he does not come until after\r\nthe second course, he is served only as the others are served, and no\r\nattempt is made to serve the previous courses to him.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner is ready, the maid or butler appears in the drawing-room\r\ndoor, catches the eye of the hostess, and announces quietly that\r\ndinner is served.\r\n\r\nUpon the signal, the host gives his arm to the guest of honor, and\r\nthey lead the way, the lady being seated at the right of her host.\r\nAfter them come the other couples as the hostess has planned. Each man\r\nhas found upon the dressing-room table an envelope addressed to him,\r\nin which is the name of the lady whom he is expected to take out to\r\ndinner, and also in the corner \"R\" or \"L\" to indicate on which side of\r\nthe table he and his lady are to sit.\r\n\r\nAfter all the others have passed out, the hostess brings up the rear\r\nwith the gentleman guest of honor, who will sit at her right.\r\n\r\nEvening dress should always be worn. For a lady a gown with low neck\r\nand short sleeves or elbow sleeves; for a gentleman, a dress coat and\r\nits accompanying trousers, vest, and tie of regulation cut and color.\r\n\r\nArrival a few minutes before the hour is customary in order for the\r\nguests to assemble in the drawing-room, greet their host and each\r\nother, and proceed together to the table.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal is finished, the hostess catches the eye of the guest at\r\nher husband's right, smiles understandingly, and they immediately\r\nrise, and, followed by the rest of the ladies, leave the room, the men\r\nstanding meanwhile. The men linger for a half-hour or so over their\r\ncigars and coffee, or liqueurs, before following the ladies into the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nIn the United States it is more usual for the men and women to leave\r\nthe dining-room together, and the hostess to serve the coffee in the\r\ndrawing-room, than it is for the men to linger by themselves at the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nAfter a dinner party one should bid good-night to the lady one has\r\ntaken out to the table, to one's host and hostess. It is not good form\r\nto omit the latter, for she should be assured that you at least have\r\nenjoyed the evening, and that her effort at hospitality has been\r\nappreciated by you. It is not necessary to take a formal leave of the\r\nother guests. If you choose you may wish them a general good-night.\r\n\r\nA ceremonious dinner begins with a tiny bit of caviare on a tiny bit\r\nof toast.\r\n\r\nThen comes the fruit. It may be melons, peaches, strawberries, or\r\ngrape fruit. It must be in perfection, and should be on ice up to the\r\nmoment of serving, and must tempt the eye as well as the palate.\r\n\r\nNext comes the course of oysters or clams on the half-shell, which\r\nshould be served on crushed ice, on oyster plates made with hollows\r\nfor the shells, and picked up with silver forks made for the purpose.\r\nOr they may be served more daintily without the ice, immediately after\r\nthey have been taken from the cooler, and without delay.\r\n\r\nThen a clear soup. It may be served from a silver tureen by the\r\nhostess, or may be brought in soup plates to the guests by the waiter.\r\n\r\nThen fish. This may be served by the host or arranged in a dainty\r\nmince and served in shells to the separate guests. If served by the\r\nhost, potatoes very daintily cooked may accompany it.\r\n\r\nThroughout the dinner olives, salted almonds, radishes, and similar\r\nrelishes may be passed. These are the only articles of food on the\r\ntable when the guests take their seats.\r\n\r\nAfter the fish there can be an entree or two of some delicate dish,\r\nbut the roast properly comes next. It may be turkey, beef, mutton, or\r\nlamb. The host may carve it if he pleases, and the waiter receive\r\nportions from him and carry them to the guests. In many houses the\r\nlady of the house is served first, and next the guest of honor, who is\r\nthe lady at the right of the host. With the roast some vegetables are\r\nserved.\r\n\r\nThen comes a salad, and with the salad cheese and crackers are served.\r\n\r\nThe dessert follows the salad, and black coffee concludes the repast.\r\nThis last may be served at the dining table, or later in the\r\ndrawing-room by the hostess.\r\n\r\nThe dessert may consist of ices, fruit, pastry, or confections.\r\nFrequently there is a final course after the sweets, consisting of\r\ncrackers and toasted cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Visits_\r\n\r\nIt is now considered quite proper for the host or hostess to specify\r\nthe length of time covered by an invitation for a visit. The\r\ncomplication of duties in our present-day life makes the assignment of\r\neven pleasures to definite periods necessary. This is as important as\r\nthe arrangement of trains and methods by which the guest may arrive\r\nand leave.\r\n\r\nThe English manner of entertaining is a very excellent one, as it\r\ngives the guest his freedom and makes his visit of the utmost profit\r\nto himself and also to his host. The English host sets the time of\r\narrival, has his servant meet the guest at the station with\r\nconveyance, has him met at the house door again by a servant, and\r\nshown to his room, where he is made at home by being offered some\r\nlight refreshments. He is told at what hour he will be received by his\r\nhost and hostess in the drawing-room, usually a short time before\r\ndinner. Then throughout his stay he does not see his hostess till\r\nmidday, although she provides amusement for her guests, which he is at\r\nliberty to enjoy or ignore as he chooses.\r\n\r\nAfter the noon meal he may do as he chooses through the afternoon,\r\nappearing only at dinner, which is the formal meal of the day, and at\r\nthe general gathering of the family and guests in the evening. The\r\nvarious members of the family are ready to show the visitors the\r\nplace, or the countryside, or play their favorite games during the\r\nday; but there is no effort to make the entertainment formal or to\r\nforce it upon the guest. We do not wish to see even our most honored\r\nguests or our dearest friends all of the time, and this arrangement\r\nmakes the meeting at dinner all the more enjoyed and valued.\r\n\r\nBefore inviting guests it is necessary to see to the comfort which is\r\nrepresented in the guest chamber. This should be as dainty and\r\ncomfortable as any chamber in the house, and, in addition to the usual\r\nfurnishings, should have other fittings intended to supply all the\r\ncomforts of one's home. A full line of towels, toilet articles, and\r\neven night robe, bathrobe, and slippers should be ready for the use of\r\nthe guest in the event that her trunk and suitcase do not arrive at\r\nthe expected time.\r\n\r\nIf the bed is fitted out with finery as well as with all the linen,\r\nblankets, and comfortables which a well-set-up bed requires, the care\r\nof the finery, its removal at night and folding up, should not be left\r\nto the guest. This should be attended to before bedtime by the maid,\r\nand the bed turned down ready for occupancy.\r\n\r\nThere should, of course, be vacant bureau drawers and wardrobe. The\r\nguest, especially if her visit be for a short time, and she has not\r\nbrought her workbox, will much appreciate a small workbasket fitted\r\nout with needles, thread, thimble, and scissors. A desk fitted with\r\nstationery, pens, and postage stamps adds much to the comfort of a\r\nguest chamber, for, no matter how brief the stay, facilities for\r\nwriting to the distant home are needed promptly and constantly.\r\n\r\nThe guest's comfort should be provided for before her entertainment or\r\namusement, and she should be made to feel perfectly at home in her\r\nroom, and her possession of it be absolute for the time of her stay.\r\n\r\nIt is a compliment to a guest to remember her favorite dishes, or to\r\narrange things to suit her known tastes and preferences.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the hostess to give the signal for retiring. This\r\nshould be done with a fine regard for the desires of guests, rather\r\nthan according to one's personal wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Special Duties of the Country Hostess_\r\n\r\nThe country hostess should make her entertaining distinctive from that\r\nof the city. Every one should, at times, return to the country, for\r\nboth physical and mental well-being. So when he is there, it is of\r\ngreat importance that he get country fare and country life, rather\r\nthan make a fruitless attempt to live in the country as he does in the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe country hostess should not attempt to entertain unless she can\r\ndepend upon her servants. Her relations with them should be such that\r\nthere is no likelihood of having a houseful of guests and the servants\r\nthereupon suddenly weary of the quiet of the country, or for any other\r\ntrivial reason promptly departing. The country hostess will, however,\r\nfit herself to meet any emergency which may arise, both on her own and\r\nher family's account, as well as on that of her guests.\r\n\r\nTherefore, housekeeping and entertaining should be simplified as much\r\nas possible, and the most unexpected of emergencies should be\r\nanticipated and provided for, as far as may be. Unless the country\r\nhostess is herself competent to cook and to tend the fires, she will\r\nnever be safe in the sending out of invitations. For the same reason,\r\nother members of the family should be trained in helpfulness, so that\r\nan emergency will simply mean the adoption of emergency tactics\r\npreviously agreed upon and practiced to the point of efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe country hostess should remember that to her guests the charm and\r\nnovelty of the fresh air and outdoor life are perhaps the greatest\r\nattractions of her home. So she should see to it that guests are left\r\nuntrammeled, to go and wander where they may wish; and also that the\r\nguest chambers and all other rooms are kept filled with fresh air even\r\nin the coldest of weather.\r\n\r\nOften the change to the invigorating country air makes the guest feel\r\ncolder than the actual temperature of the room warrants. The hostess\r\nshould remember this, and should provide that at all times the\r\nliving-rooms and guest chambers be warmed as well as ventilated. The\r\nopen fireplace is needed in addition to steam or furnace heat in an\r\nisolated country house.\r\n\r\n\"Simple things need to be excellent.\" The hostess should provide\r\nfresh fruit, chickens, eggs, vegetables, cream, and milk, the products\r\nof the country, rather than the elaborate dishes of the city.\r\n\r\nThe hostess should enjoy the country and teach her guests to enjoy it.\r\nShe should know the attractive walks and drives, the places of real\r\ninterest, and she should be able to point out the picturesque spots,\r\nand the points of vantage for especially fine views, and to make\r\nothers feel the charm of the country.\r\n\r\nThe hostess should furnish outdoor occupations, should interest her\r\nguests in making collections of curious plants from the woodlands, and\r\nin getting acquainted with the trees. There should be some popular\r\nsports provided even in midwinter, and all the necessities for the\r\nenjoyment of these should be furnished, as well as a library, games,\r\nand all sorts of indoor entertainment and pastimes for the possible\r\ndays of storm which shall block all exit from the house.\r\n\r\nThe serving of meals out of doors, if the season and weather permit,\r\nis a distinctive feature of country hospitality, and very enjoyable to\r\ncity dwellers. Breakfast and afternoon tea are especially easy to\r\nserve on the lawn or piazza, but more elaborate meals may be so served\r\nif there are servants and facilities enough. Simple meals out of doors\r\nare preferable to more elaborate meals within. In order to do this\r\nenjoyably or successfully, it is necessary to have the piazza or\r\ngarden somewhat secluded. A hedge, in the absence of other protection\r\nfrom the curious, easily makes this possible.\r\n\r\nThe informality possible in country entertaining is its greatest\r\ncharm. Neighbors should be encouraged to \"drop in\" at any hour, as the\r\nmonotony of country life may thus be greatly relieved.\r\n\r\nThe hostess who, in order to meet an emergency, is obliged to do much\r\nherself, should either simplify her plans of entertainment, so that\r\nshe could carry them through without too great weariness to play her\r\npart as hostess by being with her guests, or should call upon them to\r\nassist her, and make it a companionable visit at any rate.\r\n\r\nRural festivities are usually festivals of labor, in which all join\r\nfirst in the work and later in the play. One should endeavor to do\r\none's part of the work cheerfully, and in the spirit of good\r\ncomradeship, as well as share in the fun.\r\n\r\nOne of the most enjoyable resources of the country hostess is the\r\npicnic. This idea may be varied to suit any circumstances and any\r\nsurroundings. It may take the form of an athletic frolic for the young\r\npeople, or of a reading party in some secluded and shady glen on a\r\nhot day, if the company be intellectual, or various other forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Public Functions_\r\n\r\nMen and women of prominence are often called upon to act as special\r\nhosts and hostesses at public or semipublic functions, such as club\r\ndinners or luncheons, society receptions, school or college\r\ngraduations, receptions given by the heads of business houses on\r\nanniversaries or at openings, civil or state receptions, charitable\r\nsocial affairs, and the like.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the etiquette and duties of such occasions do not vary\r\ngreatly from those of the more private affairs, but usually greater\r\nformality is observed, and there is less responsibility on the part of\r\nthe public entertainers for the details of the service.\r\n\r\nAt a club reception and luncheon, the president and chief officers of\r\nthe club, with the guests of the day, stand in line and receive for a\r\nhalf-hour or more, in the parlors of the club. When all the guests, or\r\nthe most of them, have assembled, the procession to the dining-room is\r\nheaded by the president with the guest of greatest distinction, who is\r\nseated at his right. The other officers follow in order of rank, with\r\nthe other guests in order of distinction.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, when the last course is completed and the debris\r\nremoved, so that the tables present a neat appearance with their\r\ndecorations intact, the president rises and raps for order. Then,\r\nafter a few introductory remarks, he begins the program of the day.\r\nThese programs vary greatly, but usually include after-dinner speeches\r\nof the light and happy or only semiserious order,--unless the purpose\r\nfor which all are gathered is of serious moment,--music both\r\ninstrumental and vocal, by excellent performers, and the responses to\r\nthe speeches, either by the president or by others of the officers who\r\nmay be called upon for brief and pertinent remarks. A spirit of\r\ngood-will and enthusiasm should characterize such a gathering,\r\nwhatever the object of it.\r\n\r\nWhen one is appointed on the entertainment committee of a club, or of\r\na city, or other body of people, for the holding of a congress of any\r\nsort, it is necessary to provide in minute detail for the\r\nentertainment of guests for a period covering the entire time of their\r\nstay. Such guests should be met at the depot or boat landing, should\r\nbe given every assistance toward making them acquainted with the\r\nofficers of the congress and club, and with the city, and every detail\r\nof provision for their comfort should be looked out for. Personal\r\nsocial claims upon their time should not be so made as to conflict\r\nwith their real interest in coming, or with the advantages they may\r\nhave sought in the visit, for carrying out their personal plans.\r\n\r\nWhen one is a guest on such an occasion, he should remember that while\r\nhis entertainment may have been official, his obligation for it is\r\npersonal, and that he should personally thank his hosts and, in\r\nparticular, his special host and hostess, as if he had been their only\r\nguest. No matter how absorbing the business of the congress or\r\nconference, no matter how strenuous his own official duties, his\r\nobligation socially is imperative, and must be met.\r\n\r\nWhen one is a member of the graduating class of a school or college,\r\nor of any small group of people who, as a society, are entertaining,\r\none should show the courtesy of host or hostess to every guest. This\r\ndoes not mean that one is responsible to every guest, to see that he\r\nor she is well entertained, but that, aside from his personal\r\nresponsibilities to his own guests, he should be, at all the public\r\nfunctions, in the attitude of host to any stranger to whom he may show\r\neven the slightest hospitality.\r\n\r\nAs for his own guests, there are one or two points of special courtesy\r\nbecause of the nature of the entertainment. If he is inviting young\r\nwomen, or even only one, to whom he intends to give his whole, or a\r\nlarge part of his time, he must also invite her mother or chaperon.\r\nThis rule is invariable for the high-school boy graduate, for the\r\ngraduate of the men's college, and for the man graduate of a\r\nco-educational university.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the usual provision for guests, he must provide for\r\ntheir entertainment overnight or during their stay, if they be from\r\nthe distance. He should, in addition, and early in their visit,\r\nacquaint them with the peculiarities of the local college customs.\r\nThese customs are distinctive with each college, and their etiquette\r\nshould be made clear to one who, though unused to them, is about to\r\nshare them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE CHAPERON\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE need of the chaperon is recognized in communities where there are\r\nlarge populations, and people are necessarily of many classes and\r\nunknown to one another. For this reason the system of chaperonage of\r\nthe small communities of rural America has not been as elaborate or as\r\nstrictly adhered to as that of the cities.\r\n\r\nThe chaperon is the accepted guardian of very young girls, taking\r\noversight of them in their social life as soon as the governess gives\r\nup her charge. The chaperon is only a poor substitute for the rightful\r\ncare of a mother, or takes the place of a mother when the latter\r\ncannot be present, or performs in the person of one the duties of\r\nseveral mothers.\r\n\r\nYoung girls should never go about the streets of a city or large town\r\nunaccompanied by an older person or a maid. This rule is not so much\r\nfor physical protection as for the example of teaching her that fine\r\nconduct and discretion which will forestall the possibility of\r\nunpleasant experiences.\r\n\r\nWhen a group of young people go to some public place of amusement or\r\ninstruction, an older person should always accompany them. Such an\r\nattendant, who should be one of the fathers or mothers of the young\r\npeople, if possible, would be in so great sympathy with the spirit of\r\nthe group that his presence would impose no restraint and spoil no\r\nfun, yet it would be a curb on undue or undignified gaiety, and a\r\nprotection against criticism.\r\n\r\nThe day is not very far distant when it was expected that if a\r\ndaughter entertained a young man in the drawing-room, her father or\r\nmother would be present during the whole of the call. For debutante\r\ndaughters the custom still holds good. For a daughter who has been out\r\nin society for one or more seasons, it seems somewhat rigorous and\r\nunnecessary, as the presence of the father or mother for a part of the\r\ncall serves all the purposes of cordiality, and gives, as well, the\r\nyoung people a chance to talk without constraint of interests which\r\nseem perhaps foolish and trivial to any but young people. The wise\r\nfather and mother or chaperon know when to trust young people, and\r\nwhen it is best to throw them quite upon their honor. It is only by\r\nhaving responsibility for their actions thrust thus upon them, that\r\nthey ever attain to natural dignity and self-reliance.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes permitted to a young woman to be escorted to a party\r\nor entertainment alone by a young man, but only by one who is\r\nwell-known to the family as quite to be trusted, and only to such\r\nparties as are presided over by responsible patronesses. This should\r\nbe exceptional for any but the young woman who has been left without\r\nimmediate family and who has been already in society more than one\r\nseason. The duenna who acts as her natural guardian and chaperon,\r\nordinarily accompanies her.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that there are large numbers of young women who are\r\nof necessity unprotected by adequate chaperonage,--through loss of\r\nrelatives, financial limitations, or the following of some business\r\ncalling or profession,--and that they are not, in general, treated\r\nwith less respect than the young woman carefully guarded in her home.\r\nIt yet remains true that the independent girl must needs provide for\r\nherself a chaperon upon certain occasions, or lose that consideration\r\nwhich she would keep at all costs. A strong character welcomes the aid\r\nof a careful observance of conventions.\r\n\r\nEven the spinster of recognized professional standing finds herself\r\nsomewhat restricted in social pleasures. She cannot go out socially\r\nwith one man more than occasionally; she has little pleasure in going\r\nunattended; she can entertain but infrequently and in a small way, if\r\nat all, and never without an older married woman to assist her. She\r\nmay, however, have her regular afternoon or evening \"At Home,\"\r\nprovided she has with her this friend; and with that friend present,\r\nshe may entertain a gentleman caller until ten o'clock in the evening,\r\nbut she may not offer him cigarettes, nor any beverage but tea,\r\ncoffee, chocolate, or lemonade.\r\n\r\nIn fashionable life in the cities, the chaperon is an important and\r\never-present personage. Wherever the young debutante goes in\r\nsociety,--to every place of amusement, when walking or driving in the\r\npark, when shopping or calling,--and during her calling hours at home,\r\nthe chaperon is her faithful and interested attendant.\r\n\r\nThe common usage of smaller towns, seashore places, and country\r\nvillages differs in degree of attendance. The only wise rule is to\r\nfollow the custom of the place in which one may happen to be,\r\nremembering always that the principle at the basis of the custom is\r\nwise and valuable, and that there should be good and sufficient reason\r\nfor failing to follow it in its entirety. It is, however, not the\r\nletter of the law but the spirit of it which saves. Experience shows\r\nthat not always the completely chaperoned girl is safe and the\r\nquite-free girl in real danger. Everything depends upon the girl, and\r\nthe spirit of the chaperonage she receives. The relations with one's\r\nchaperon should be the most intimate and reliable and trustworthy of\r\none's whole life; or they may be a mere farce and evasion. As a rule,\r\nhowever, too strict observance of the dictates of society in this\r\nconnection is better than too lax.\r\n\r\nThe careless way in which many parents allow their sons and daughters\r\nto go off with a group of boys and girls of their own age, unattended\r\nby any adult, is to be deplored. Among the parents of several young\r\npeople there certainly is some parent, who cares enough about his\r\nchildren and their associates to become a chum, and be at once a\r\nmagnet to draw them to more mature and valuable ways of thinking, and\r\na safeguard against that group folly towards which the\r\nirresponsibility of youth tends.\r\n\r\nUntil a girl makes her debut in society, she is not seen at a party of\r\nadults except in her own home, and not there at a formal entertainment\r\nunless it be a birthday party, a marriage, or a christening.\r\n\r\nEven after an engagement is announced, the chaperon is still the\r\nattendant of the young couple in fashionable circles, when they go to\r\nany place of public amusement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE ETIQUETTE OF THE MARRIAGE ENGAGEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is a wise and courteous action on the part of a lover to consult\r\nwith the parents of the young woman and win their consent to his\r\nproposals before he presents them to her. This is largely a form in\r\nAmerica, for the reason that in a well-ordered home the young man has\r\nnot had much opportunity to pay attention to the daughter, unless the\r\nfather and mother have considered him eligible for their daughter's\r\nfriendship; also, the daughter, rather than the parents, does the\r\nchoosing, and few parents would have the temerity to refuse a young\r\nman, whom they had permitted to enter their home, a chance to try his\r\nfate. Should they have good cause for such refusal, they should have\r\nused their influence and authority to counteract any favorable\r\nimpression the young man may have made, before matters came to a\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Proposal_\r\n\r\nIn matters of great moment, where the emotions are deeply stirred, the\r\ntrivialities of etiquette are at once superfluous and important.\r\n\r\nOne may be so greatly overwrought as to do the unintentionally cruel\r\nand inconsiderate thing, unless habitual good breeding comes to the\r\nrescue, and steadies one by showing what is the conventional thing to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nNo woman should permit a friendship to culminate in a proposal of\r\nmarriage unless she is free to entertain such a proposal and has not\r\ndecided in her own mind upon a negative answer. Of course, there are\r\ntimes when she receives, without power to check it, an unwelcome\r\nproposal. Her refusal then should be very decisive but very\r\nconsiderate. She should express regret at the situation, and her\r\nappreciation of the honor which has been done her, at the same time\r\nleaving no opportunity for future hope. In case she is already\r\nengaged, she should tell him so.\r\n\r\nIf the proposal be written, it requires an immediate answer. Urgency\r\nof response is determined by the importance to the sender.\r\n\r\nThe return of a letter unopened, even if the woman have good reason to\r\nthink that it contains a proposal which she must refuse, is extremely\r\nrude, and should be done under no circumstances but flagrant breach of\r\nconfidence. If a letter is received by a woman from a man whom she has\r\nrefused and whose persistency she has sought to end, she may place the\r\nletter in the hands of her parents, or guardians, or legal\r\nrepresentatives, to be acted on as they think best.\r\n\r\nThe manner of a proposal is the touchstone of character. No man and\r\nwoman, having passed through this experience together, can fail to\r\nhave obtained at least a glimpse of the depths or the shallows of each\r\nother's character.\r\n\r\nIn a great majority of cases in America, at least, where access to the\r\nyoung woman is gained through a thousand social channels, the real\r\ndeclaration of love comes spontaneously, and is accepted or rejected\r\nbefore there is opportunity even for the formal proposal. For by a\r\nthousand half-unconscious signs does that state of mind reveal itself.\r\nSo it happens that when the opportunity offers to settle the matter,\r\nthere is little doubt in the mind of the lover and little hesitation\r\non the part of the woman. This is true in that society where really\r\nwell-bred and noble-minded women hold sway, for no woman of character\r\npermits the man to be long in doubt of her withdrawal of herself, when\r\nshe sees he is attracted and yet knows that she cannot respond to his\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\nThe method of proposing is not a matter for a book on etiquette. It\r\nconcerns, along with all major matters of morals, those deeper things\r\nof life, for which there is no instruction beyond the inculcation of\r\nhigh ideals.\r\n\r\nWhen the engagement is a fact and so acknowledged in the home, it is\r\nnot a wise or courteous thing for the engaged couple to monopolize\r\neach other. Consideration on the part of the family would see to it\r\nthat they have some time to be alone together. Yet the lovers should\r\nbe as careful to keep their place in the social life of the home as if\r\nthere were no special attachment. For social exclusiveness shows an\r\nabsorption in each other which, if selfishly indulged, will bring its\r\nown penalty. That a couple are engaged denotes expectation of a future\r\nwhen they will be thrown largely upon each other's society; and,\r\nbecause it is essential for those who are to marry to become\r\nthoroughly acquainted, they should together mingle with other people,\r\nfor so are the actual traits of character best brought out. This does\r\nnot mean that they should avoid or neglect being alone together at\r\ntimes, but they should not obviously and selfishly absent themselves.\r\n\r\nThe young woman should be formally courteous to her affianced husband,\r\nand should never slight him because he is pledged to her, nor unduly\r\nexalt him for the same reason. She should now remember that the broad\r\nworld of her social interests is narrowing as they intensify, and she\r\nshould not attempt in any way to break the bounds set for the engaged\r\ngirl. She should not go alone with other young men to places of\r\namusement or entertainment. She should maintain her dignity so\r\ncarefully as an affianced wife, that her betrothed shall not have the\r\nslightest reason to be jealous of the attention she gives to the men\r\nwhom she meets in society. On the other hand she must not cater to the\r\nman she is to marry, to the extent of failing to do her social duty,\r\nor of making others feel that she has no interest in them.\r\n\r\nAs members of the same social set, the engaged couple will naturally\r\nmeet much in society. They should not meet with effusion, or\r\nsufficiently marked discrimination to make others about them\r\nembarrassed. They should not spend too much time with each other.\r\nTheir hostess will send them out to dinner together,--which is in\r\nmarked contrast to the custom later when they are married, for then\r\nthey will always be separated when in society. The young woman should\r\nbe careful not to permit her fiance to take her away in a corner from\r\nother guests for a long time, and he should remember to do his social\r\nduty by other young ladies present, even if he wishes to devote\r\nhimself to one.\r\n\r\nThe task of meeting each other's friends, after the engagement is\r\nannounced, is one which should be most interesting and enjoyable, and\r\nshould have nothing of that embarrassment which comes from the sense\r\nof critical scrutiny. The great ordeal of winning each other is\r\ndecided, and the die cast. The smaller matter of establishing\r\nfriendships on a mutual basis should be a pleasure and not an object\r\nof dread. Real affection and deep sincerity will make all prominent\r\nroughnesses smooth.\r\n\r\nAn engaged couple are apt to be in the foreground of any social event\r\nwhich they may both grace with their presence. The common human\r\ninterest of the unengaged, and the reminiscent interest of the\r\nmarried, tend to focus all eyes upon them. For this reason they will\r\ntry and be as little conspicuous as may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Announcement of Engagement_\r\n\r\nThe announcement of an engagement may be made in several ways, but\r\nalways first by the family of the young woman. If a public newspaper\r\nannouncement is desired, a notice similar to the following, signed\r\nwith a name and address, must be sent to the society editor of the\r\nlocal paper or papers:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Howard Abbott announce the engagement of their daughter\r\nEthel to Mr. Hayden B. Bradley, of Cleveland. The date of the wedding\r\nhas not been fixed, but it will probably take place soon after\r\nEaster.\"\r\n\r\nOr it may read: \"Miss Ethel Abbott announces her engagement to Mr.\r\nHayden B. Bradley,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIf a less public announcement is desired, the young couple may each\r\nwrite personal notes to their friends. In these notes one or two\r\nafternoons are mentioned when the young woman with her mother will be\r\n\"At Home.\" This gives an opportunity for the relatives and friends of\r\nthe young man to meet his fiancee.\r\n\r\nThe entertainment will be an informal afternoon tea, in which she and\r\nher mother receive, the former wearing a pretty but not too\r\nrich-looking gown with long or elbow sleeves. Sandwiches, cakes, and\r\ntea should be served.\r\n\r\nIf an engagement is to be for long, it would be well to have the\r\nannouncement of it as quiet as possible, or not to announce it until\r\nthe time for the wedding draws near, and, also, for the young people\r\nnot to be seen very much together until its final stages.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the announcement of an engagement, the mother of the\r\nman should at once call upon the young woman and her mother, and\r\ninvite them, or the entire family, to dinner.\r\n\r\nThe family of the young man should be the first to make advances. The\r\nother members of the young man's family should call upon the young\r\nwoman promptly, even if they have never met her before, or, if calling\r\nis impossible, they should write and express their approval and good\r\nwishes. According to the position of the family, should the\r\nelaborateness of entertainment be. It is a nice custom, when the young\r\nlady lives in another city and has never met the family of her fiance,\r\nfor them to invite her to come and visit them.\r\n\r\nThe calls of his family upon her, and their letters to her, should be\r\nvery promptly returned or answered.\r\n\r\nIf the young woman live in the country, her father will invite the\r\nyoung man for a visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bridal \"Showers\"_\r\n\r\nThe bestowal of engagement presents has of late years taken on a\r\nwholesale aspect. Instead of the occasional receipt of a present from\r\none or another of her friends and relatives, the bride-elect is often\r\nnow the guest of honor at one or more parties called \"showers,\" and\r\nthe recipient of numerous gifts which are literally showered upon her.\r\nThere are many kinds of \"showers,\" as many as the ingenuity and\r\nfinancial resources of friends may admit of. When, however, any one\r\nbride is to be made the object of a series of such attentions, it is\r\nwell for the girl's friends who have the matter in hand to see to it\r\nthat no one person is invited to more than one shower, or, if so\r\ninvited, that it be at her own request and because she wishes to make\r\nseveral gifts to her friend.\r\n\r\nThese affairs should be purely spontaneous and informal, and occasions\r\nof much fun and jollity. Nevertheless, there is danger of overdoing\r\nthe idea, and making the recipient feel burdened rather than gratified\r\nby the zeal of her friends in her behalf.\r\n\r\nEffort should be made not to have the articles given at a \"shower\"\r\nduplicate each other. They should be some simple, useful gifts, which\r\nwill be of immediate service, and need not be either expensive or\r\nespecially durable, unless the giver so desires. A \"shower\" is usually\r\ngiven when a wedding is in prospect, and the necessity of stocking up\r\nthe new home confronts the young home-makers. The aim is to take a\r\nkindly interest in the new home and help to fit it out, more in the\r\nway of suggestion than in any extravagant way, which would make the\r\nrecipients feel embarrassed or indebted, or overload them with\r\nsemidesirable gifts.\r\n\r\nThe \"shower\" is usually in the afternoon, and is joined in almost\r\nexclusively by the girl friends of the bride-elect, with perhaps a few\r\nof her older women friends and relatives. If, however, it comes in the\r\nevening, the men of the bridal party are usually also invited. The\r\nrefreshments are simple and the style of entertainment informal. The\r\ninvitations to a \"shower\" are usually given by the hostess verbally,\r\nor she sends her cards by post with the words \"Linen shower for Miss\r\nHanley on Wednesday at four.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a wide range of possible kinds of \"showers,\" but the only\r\nrational way is to choose for a donation party of this sort only such\r\nobjects as will be needed in quantity and variety, and in the choice\r\nof which one has not too strong and distinctive taste, as, for\r\ninstance, the following: Linen, towels, glass, books, fancy china,\r\nsilver, spoons, aprons, etc. Of course, the furnishings of some one\r\nroom, as the bath-room, laundry, or kitchen, might be the subject of a\r\n\"shower,\" but usually a housewife would prefer to have what she wanted\r\nand nothing else for use in these places.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Broken Engagement_\r\n\r\nWhen an engagement is broken the young woman should return to the\r\nyoung man all letters and presents, and may ask, by a brief,\r\ncourteous, but dignified, note, for the return of her letters to him.\r\nIt would not be necessary, ordinarily, to write such a note, as the\r\nman would take the sending back of his gifts as final, and to mean the\r\nreturn of hers also.\r\n\r\nIn case the wedding is near, so that wedding presents have been\r\nreceived from friends, the no longer \"bride-elect\" should return them\r\nto the givers with an explanatory note. The note should mention\r\nnothing beyond the fact that the engagement has been broken.\r\n\r\nThe mother of the young woman is the one to announce the breaking of\r\nthe engagement. She quietly does so, by word of mouth or notes to\r\nfriends. In case of a broken engagement, it is not delicate to allude\r\nto it, unless one is a very intimate friend, and then it is better to\r\nleave the first broaching of the subject to the one most concerned.\r\n\r\nIt is customary for the privilege to be granted the woman of\r\nterminating an engagement without offering any explanation other than\r\nher will. Nevertheless, she will not use this privilege arbitrarily,\r\nwithout casting a shadow upon her reputation and character for\r\nfaithfulness and integrity. A man is expected to make no explanation,\r\neven privately, as to the reason for the breaking of the engagement,\r\nas the release must at least appear to come from the woman. Whatever\r\nshe chooses to say, or however unjust the remarks of friends seem, he\r\nis in honor bound to show great reserve, and not to cast any shadow\r\nupon her reputation, even if his own suffers instead.\r\n\r\nHowever, in many circles to-day it is enough to say that an engagement\r\nhas been broken mutually, even though no reason is obvious. This\r\nshould be so, for if too much comment attaches to the breaking of a\r\nmarriage engagement, marriages will be entered into the almost\r\ncertain outcome of which is the divorce court.\r\n\r\nA lady should never accept any but trivial gifts, such as flowers, a\r\nbook, a piece of music, or a box of confectionery, from a gentleman\r\nwho is not related to her. Even a marriage engagement does not make\r\nthe acceptance of costly gifts wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparation for a Wedding_\r\n\r\nThe preparation which the bridegroom makes for the new home, is, of\r\ncourse, by far the larger share of its establishment. He provides the\r\nhome, furnishes it with everything but the linen, which the bride will\r\nbring, and the ornamental decorations, including silver for the table,\r\nwhich the wedding guests may, in these days of lavish presents, be\r\nexpected to furnish.\r\n\r\nEven if he does not choose to set up a house-home at once, the\r\nprovision for the future is all his, and he has to bring to the\r\nwedding the wherewithal to make a home, whether it be in household\r\nfurniture or only the certificates of wealth with which to provide for\r\nthe bride. This is a matter of pride with even the poorest\r\nlover,--with all save that small class of men who, either from the\r\nmost worldly of motives or, in the very opposite extreme, from motives\r\nso high that they will not permit personal pride to stand in the way\r\nof the real union of hearts, submit to the indignity of becoming\r\npensioners rather than donors.\r\n\r\nWhatever the custom for the division of responsibility in regard to\r\nthe home and the future, in actual life, in every true home\r\nresponsibility is equal, and convenience alone decrees what the bride\r\nand the bridegroom shall each contribute to the common hoard.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom also provides a part of the wedding, and although his\r\nshare is minimized, yet it is often a costly and important part. He\r\nshould provide the flowers which the bride and her attendants carry.\r\nThe bride usually chooses her flowers, which are ordinarily white\r\nroses, lilies of the valley, or fragrant white flowers of her favorite\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nBesides providing the wedding ring, the bridegroom usually presents to\r\nthe bride some gift. It is perhaps the deed of the house he has bought\r\nand furnished for her. Or it may be jewelry, or anything else that she\r\ndesires and that he may have it in his power to bestow. The bride\r\nmakes him no special gift other than her hand, as that is her supreme\r\ngift.\r\n\r\nThe personal provision of the bridegroom sometimes consists of a new\r\nwardrobe throughout, besides his wedding suit. If he is wise he will\r\nwear his new suits somewhat before he appears in them as newly\r\nmarried. His wedding suit will consist of evening dress, if he is to\r\nbe married in the evening, complete with white gloves and tie, and\r\nboutonniere of the same flowers as the bride's bouquet. If married in\r\nthe afternoon, or any time before six o'clock, he will wear a frock\r\ncoat of black, white vest, gray trousers, and white tie and gloves. In\r\ncase the wedding is in the evening and the bride is to wear her\r\ntraveling dress, hat, and gloves, the bridegroom may wear the same\r\nsuit as for an afternoon wedding, if he chooses.\r\n\r\nThe custom of having a new wardrobe throughout is not necessarily\r\nfollowed, of course. It is through the bridegroom's consideration for\r\nthe bride, and his appreciation of the housewifely duties which she\r\nundertakes on his behalf, that he makes those as small as possible at\r\nfirst, knowing that the years will bring her her full share.\r\n\r\nThe bride's wedding wardrobe is made a matter of special moment,\r\nbecause it is for the last time that she is outfitted by her father.\r\nTherefore, he wishes to give her all that she needs for some time to\r\ncome, that she may grow used to reliance upon her husband before he\r\nhas to undertake the burden of her personal expenses in the matter of\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nThe outlay, however, is limited in quantity to the probable needs of\r\nthe first season of married life, if the bride is wise, as there is no\r\nwisdom in having more garments than can be worn to advantage before\r\nthe style changes.\r\n\r\nNo sensible woman will set a standard of expenditure too high for her\r\nfuture income, in what she buys for her wedding wardrobe. The only\r\ncircumstances in which she should exceed the modest sum of her usual\r\noutlay,--beyond the fact that she needs more and special garments for\r\nthe different social occasions, and has a pride in having them as nice\r\nas possible,--are those in which she marries a man of much higher\r\nsocial station and much larger income than her own. In that case it\r\nmay be well for her to put some of her savings for the future into the\r\ngowns which she knows will be necessary for her in her new station.\r\n\r\nThe special gowns necessary for a bride are: Her wedding gown,--which\r\nis of pure white if a maiden, or pearl gray or some other delicate\r\ncolor if a widow,--the wedding veil, the traveling suit, a reception\r\ngown, a church suit, a somewhat elaborate visiting suit, a plain\r\nstreet suit, house dresses, a dainty wrapper, and a new outfitting of\r\nunderclothing, in number and quality to suit her usual custom, or as\r\nnice as she can afford.\r\n\r\nFor the bride whose purse is not overfull the number of gowns and\r\nsuits can be materially diminished; the wedding gown, with some slight\r\nchanges, such as the removal of the high collar and long sleeves, can\r\nbe used as an evening dress; the traveling, church, and visiting suit\r\nmay be one and the same; the house dresses may be reduced to a minimum\r\nby frequent washing. That one cannot provide an elaborate wardrobe\r\nwith which to begin married life should not be a barrier to a marriage\r\nwhich in every other respect appears to be auspicious.\r\n\r\nThe bride's trousseau proper, or that store of linen which she\r\nprovides for her new home, should consist of approximately the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nFor every bed three pairs of sheets, three pairs of pillow cases,\r\nthree bolster cases, one or two pairs of blankets, two counterpanes,\r\nand an extra quilt.\r\n\r\nFor her bedrooms she should provide table, stand, and bureau covers,\r\nas the style of the furniture may suggest, and also such covers for\r\ncouch pillows or armchairs as a thrifty housewife would desire for the\r\nsake of cleanliness.\r\n\r\nFor the bath-room there should be three dozen towels, a half-dozen\r\nbath towels. Towels for the maid should also be included.\r\n\r\nFor the dining-room, four tablecloths and two dozen napkins for common\r\nuse, with two finer tablecloths and two dozen napkins for special\r\noccasions, make ample provision for the average home. There should be\r\ndoilies and tray cloths, covers for the sideboard, also mats and\r\ncenterpieces for the table.\r\n\r\nFor the kitchen, three dozen cloth towels for dishes, hand towels,\r\ncleaning cloths, holders, and every necessary sort of towel in\r\nabundance. With the increasing use of the paper towel, much of this\r\nprovision for bath-room and kitchen may be dispensed with, as the\r\npaper towel is much neater and more economical.\r\n\r\nThe wedding gown, which is of white satin or silk, and usually as rich\r\nand elegant as the bride can afford, is always cut high in the neck\r\nand with long sleeves, or, if elbow sleeves, they are supplemented by\r\nlong gloves, which are not removed even at the wedding breakfast. The\r\ncustom is to wear white exclusively from veil to shoes. Whether or not\r\nthe veil is worn, a hat is never provided for this gown.\r\n\r\nIt is customary, in case a bride is married in her traveling suit, for\r\nher to wear the hat and gloves which go with it. At a home wedding,\r\nhowever, this rule is not usually adhered to, unless the couple leave\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nThe bridal veil and orange blossoms are worn only at the first\r\nmarriage of a woman, and usually only with a gown made with a train.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom should acquaint himself with the rules and regulations\r\nin regard to the marriage license some weeks ahead of the date set for\r\nthe wedding, if possible, as the rules vary in different states, and\r\nin some a period of residence or notification is necessary.\r\n\r\nA marriage certificate, furnishing easily available knowledge of the\r\nlegality of the marriage and its date, is often of great convenience\r\nin the disposition of property, the probating of wills, and in the\r\nsettlement of numerous questions which might arise in minor matters.\r\nThis should be provided before the ceremony, filled out and signed\r\nimmediately after it by the officiating clergyman, and signed by\r\nseveral witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe wedding ring is, by long established custom, a plain gold band. It\r\nshould be of the best gold, and the fashion now is for it to be\r\nmoderately narrow and thin rather than wide and thick. The ring, the\r\nunbroken circle, is symbolic of eternity. The bridegroom gives it into\r\nthe keeping of the best man, whose duty it is to hand it promptly to\r\nhim at the proper moment of the ceremony. The initials and date are\r\nengraved upon the inner surface of the ring. When wider rings were\r\nworn some appropriate sentiment was also often engraved.\r\n\r\nOnce placed upon the bride's finger, it is her pride to see that it is\r\nnever removed. As Mrs. Sangster feelings says, \"It is a badge of\r\nhonor, and, worn on any woman's hand, a symbol of her right to belong\r\nto the ranks of worthy matrons.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well to rehearse the movements of the bridal procession within a\r\nday or two of the ceremony, that there may be no flaw in the conduct\r\nof the actors in this dramatic bit of realism. If it is to be a church\r\nwedding, more than one rehearsal may be required. In that case the\r\norganist should be present, as well as every member of the bridal\r\nparty, except the clergyman. The opening of the church for such\r\nrehearsal is included in the fee which the sexton receives, which\r\nranges from ten to fifty dollars.\r\n\r\nUsually refreshments, in the form of either a dinner or supper, follow\r\nthe rehearsal, the bride entertaining at her home.\r\n\r\nIf the Episcopal service is to be used, or any other service in which\r\nthe bride and bridegroom kneel, cushions for their use should be\r\nprovided. These are usually covered in white satin, with outer covers\r\nof very sheer lawn upon which the initials may be worked.\r\n\r\nThe floral decorations of the church or home should be subordinated to\r\nthe main interest; that is, they should not be too elaborate, take up\r\ntoo much room, or do other than furnish a fitting background for the\r\nbridal couple. The decorations usually follow some definite color\r\nscheme, although simply the white flowers with green foliage are\r\nappropriate and symbolic for a church wedding. A few palms, simple\r\nbouquets of flowers arranged naturally and gracefully, with foliage to\r\ncontrast and fill the corners, will decorate an altar or make a\r\npleasant bower. When costliness rather than beauty is the effect of\r\nflowers, the display is vulgar.\r\n\r\nAn awning should be stretched from the house or church door to the\r\nsidewalk, so that the guests and bridal party may not be subjected to\r\nthe gaze of curious passers-by as they leave the carriages. An\r\nattendant should be stationed at the sidewalk to open the doors of the\r\ncarriages, and to give to the coachmen and guests numbers by which\r\ntheir carriages may be speedily called.\r\n\r\nWhile the provision of the carriages belongs with all other things to\r\nthe bride's family, the carriages for the bridegroom and his family\r\nare provided by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE CONDUCT OF A WEDDING\r\n\r\n\r\nIN cities at present the most fashionable hour for the ceremony is\r\n\"high noon,\" following the English custom, and in remembrance of the\r\nlong-standing tradition which placed the wedding early in the day,\r\nbefore the night's fast had been broken.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon is a suitable time, as it enables friends to gather more\r\nconveniently from the distance, and as the reception with refreshments\r\nis much more easily arranged for than is a breakfast. For an afternoon\r\nwedding, three o'clock is the proper hour in the winter, four o'clock\r\nin the summer.\r\n\r\nThe evening was at one period the fashionable time, and it still\r\nretains its popularity and long will among the middle class of people\r\nand in the country, because a larger gathering of friends can be\r\nexpected at that time, as all are free from business and household\r\ncares.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Church Wedding_\r\n\r\nFor the church wedding special arrangements must be made for the\r\nseating of the guests. A certain number of pews in the center front\r\nof the church are reserved for the families and intimate friends of\r\nthe bride and bridegroom. The reservation is indicated by a broad\r\nwhite ribbon barrier across the aisle, or a garland of flowers. The\r\nfamily of the bride is seated on one side of the aisle, and that of\r\nthe bridegroom on the other.\r\n\r\nThe ushers should be at the church at least a half-hour before the\r\nguests begin to arrive. They wear small buttonhole bouquets of flowers\r\nlike those used in the decorations of the church, which are sent them\r\nthere by the florist.\r\n\r\nIn seating the guests they should take great care to seat in the\r\nreserved space only those whose names are on the list given them as\r\nbelonging there. Therefore, they ask the name of each guest whom they\r\ndo not know before assigning him his seat. Sometimes, however, each of\r\nthese special guests is provided with a card which he gives to the\r\nusher.\r\n\r\nWhen a gentleman and lady enter the church together, the usher offers\r\nhis right arm to the lady, and the gentleman follows them as they\r\nproceed down the aisle. When several ladies arrive together, the usher\r\noffers his arm to the eldest, and requests the others to follow as he\r\nconducts her to her seat.\r\n\r\nEach usher asks of each guest whether he is friend of the bride or\r\nbridegroom, and seats him accordingly, upon the left of the church if\r\na friend of the bride, upon the right if a friend of the groom. In\r\ncase the bridegroom is from the distance, and therefore there are few\r\nof his friends present, this custom is not followed.\r\n\r\nImmediately before the bridal party appears, the mother of the bride\r\nis escorted by the head usher to a seat in the front pew. Any sisters\r\nor brothers of the bride who may not be in the bridal procession enter\r\nwith their mother.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the bridal party has been gathering, the bridesmaids going\r\nto the home of the bride and there receiving from her their bouquets,\r\nwhich are the gift of the bridegroom. Thence they take carriages to\r\nthe church, where they all arrive at the hour set for the ceremony.\r\nWhen the first carriage arrives, containing two of the\r\nbridesmaids,--as the carriage of the bride and her father is the\r\nlast,--the head usher closes the inner vestibule door, and the other\r\nushers see that all entrance at side doors is barred. When the bride\r\narrives the outer street doors are closed, and the procession forms.\r\nTwo of the ushers have already carried the broad white ribbon down the\r\nsides of the main aisle, thus shutting in the pews, and have taken\r\ndown the ribbon barrier across it.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom and his best man have come in a carriage by themselves\r\nand entered the church by the vestry door. They and the clergyman\r\nawait the notice of the bride's arrival.\r\n\r\nThe organist, who has been playing appropriate selections while the\r\nguests were assembling, begins on the wedding march as the doors to\r\nthe church are thrown open in signal that all is in readiness. The\r\naudience rises. The clergyman takes his place, and the bridgegroom and\r\nbest man enter, the former standing at the clergyman's left, the\r\nlatter just behind the bridegroom, who is facing the aisle down which\r\nthe bride will come.\r\n\r\nFirst come the ushers, two and two, keeping pace with the time of the\r\nmusic, which is a stately, dignified march. The bridesmaids follow,\r\nalso two and two, with about six feet of space between each couple.\r\nThe maid of honor alone, or the maid and matron of honor together,\r\nthen come. The flower girl, or flower children follow, scattering\r\nflowers from a basket hung upon the left arm.\r\n\r\nThen come the bride and her father, or nearest male relative, she with\r\ndowncast eyes and leaning upon his right arm.\r\n\r\nThe procession divides as it reaches a spot opposite the place where\r\nthe bride and bridegroom are to stand, or, in an Episcopal church, the\r\ntop of the chancel steps; half go to the right and half to the left.\r\nThe bridesmaids stand between the ushers, all being grouped in a\r\nsemicircle. The maid of honor stands at the left, in front of the\r\nbridesmaids and near the bride.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom advances to meet the bride, who leaves her father and\r\ntakes the bridegroom's hand, then accepts his left arm and is escorted\r\nby him to a position in front of the clergyman. The couple kneel for a\r\nmoment before the ceremony begins.\r\n\r\nAt the place in the ceremony where the question is asked, \"Who giveth\r\nthis woman to be married to this man?\" the father, who has been\r\nstanding a few feet back, advances and places the bride's right hand\r\nin that of the clergyman, who places it in the right hand of the\r\nbridegroom. The father then takes his seat in the front pew with his\r\nwife, whom, as they leave the church, he escorts.\r\n\r\nShould a widowed mother be the only one to respond to this inquiry,\r\nshe simply rises from her seat and bows. In such a case the bridegroom\r\nusually enters with the bride, and the procession is less elaborate.\r\n\r\nWhen the troth is being plighted and the ring is about to be given,\r\nthe best man hands it to the bridegroom, who passes it to the bride.\r\nShe hands it to the clergyman, who returns it to the bridegroom. Then\r\nthe latter places it upon the third finger of the bride's left hand.\r\nThe significance of the passing of the ring is that it completes a\r\ncircle, the symbol of eternity, of which the clergyman is one, thus\r\nsymbolizing the sanction of the church.\r\n\r\nAfter the ceremony the clergyman congratulates the newly wedded\r\ncouple, and the bride takes the right arm of her husband, walking thus\r\ndown the aisle, the bridal party following in reverse order, the\r\nushers therefore last. Even at a stately church ceremonial it has been\r\nknown for the bride to stop and kiss her mother before passing down\r\nthe aisle.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the maid of honor during the service are to take from\r\nthe bride her glove and bouquet as the clergyman asks the bride and\r\nbridegroom to join hands. Then it is her care to remove the veil from\r\nbefore the face of the bride when the ceremony is over, and to turn\r\nthe train of her gown that it may fall rightly as she passes up the\r\naisle.\r\n\r\nOccasionally when there are two main aisles to the church, the bridal\r\nprocession enters on the one amid the friends of the bride, and\r\nreturns on that amid the friends of the groom, to signify that the\r\nbride has now become one of them.\r\n\r\nThe best man follows the clergyman to the vestry, hands him the fee,\r\nif the groom had not before done so, and passes down the side aisle to\r\nsignal for the bridal carriage, and to give the bridegroom his hat and\r\ncoat. He then goes to the bride's house, where he assists the ushers\r\nin introducing the guests to the pair.\r\n\r\nThe organist starts up a very joyous march at the conclusion of the\r\nceremony, and continues playing while the guests are dispersing.\r\n\r\nFollowing the bridal procession the families and intimate friends of\r\nthe couple pass out before the audience, as the ribbon barriers which\r\nreserve the aisle are not taken down until all have passed out. If the\r\nreception is at the home, this gives the bridal party time to enter\r\nthe carriages; if the reception is in the church parlors, it gives\r\ntime for them to take their places in the receiving line.\r\n\r\nAt the bride's home there is now time, before the guests arrive, for\r\nall of the bridal party to congratulate and felicitate the bride and\r\nbridegroom, and also to sign after them the register of the marriage,\r\nwhich is in the care of the best man. This is usually in the form of a\r\nbook bound in white, with the initials of the bride and bridegroom\r\nembossed upon it, and opportunity is usually given for the wedding\r\nguests to add their signatures also.\r\n\r\nThe bride's mother, who is the real hostess of the occasion, stands\r\nnear the entrance of the room in which the reception is held. In a\r\nreceiving line at the head of the room stand the bride and bridegroom\r\nwith half of the bridesmaids ranged on the bride's right and the\r\nother half on the groom's left. The parents of the groom stand near\r\nand the father of the bride with them or with his wife, as host. The\r\nushers present the guests to the bride and bridegroom, and then to\r\ntheir parents, as guests of honor. A few words of congratulation to\r\nthe bridegroom and of best wishes to the bride are all that the few\r\nmoments possible for each guest permit. The bride offers her hand to\r\neach guest, and presents to her husband her friends, as he does his to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Home Wedding_\r\n\r\nThe home wedding may be made in every way quite as ideal as the church\r\nwedding, and is much more simple, its privacy appealing to many. The\r\nhouse will be decorated with flowers in good taste and not too great\r\nprofusion. Usually a canopy or bower of flowers and foliage is erected\r\nat the head of the drawing-room. This should not be too massive, as\r\nonly a special grouping of the flowers is preferable to an arrangement\r\nwhich is too crowded or shaded.\r\n\r\nAs the guests arrive the mother and sisters of the bride receive them.\r\nThe father of the bride does not appear, nor, of course, does the\r\nbride, until they enter together. A room is placed at the disposal of\r\nthe bridegroom, the best man, and the clergyman.\r\n\r\nAt the stroke of the hour appointed, the clergyman enters and takes\r\nhis stand facing the company. The bridegroom and best man also enter\r\nand stand at the left of the clergyman, the best man somewhat behind.\r\nAs in a church wedding, the broad white ribbon is used to mark the\r\naisle. If bouquets are attached to the ends of it, they will hold it\r\nin place.\r\n\r\nThen from the farthest corner of the room enters the bridal\r\nprocession, formed as for a church wedding.\r\n\r\nAt a simple house wedding there are often no attendants, the bride and\r\nbridegroom entering the room together, the bride's father having taken\r\nhis position near at hand, where he can readily respond at the right\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nAnother way of forming the procession, which has all the advantages of\r\nthe more elaborate one, is for the best man to follow the ushers, then\r\nthe one bridesmaid to enter immediately preceding the bride and\r\nbridegroom.\r\n\r\nMusic is often dispensed with at a home wedding.\r\n\r\nWhen the ceremony is over the clergyman congratulates the couple and\r\nwithdraws, and they, turning, face their friends, who then come to\r\nwish them happiness.\r\n\r\nWhether the wedding take place in the home or at the church, the\r\nbridal pageant has only one object in view,--it is wholly for the\r\nsake of the bridegroom. Every woman desires to come to her husband in\r\nall the glory of her womanhood and of her social position. By all\r\ncustom the bridegroom does not see his bride upon the wedding day\r\nuntil she approaches him as he stands at the altar. So, with her\r\nfamily doing her the utmost honor that they can, she comes to him,\r\nbringing all that she has and is, and placing herself and her future\r\nin his care. The coming is just as real, however, though the utmost\r\nsimplicity prevail.\r\n\r\nBack of all the minute detail of wedding custom there is a symbolism.\r\nWith the constant elevation of the standards of marriage, this\r\nsymbolism and these customs grow purer and more in accord with the\r\nideals. Just as it is always taken for granted that a marriage\r\nceremony is uniting loving hearts, so little by little all that is at\r\nvariance with that thought will drop away, as have already several\r\nminor details, and new forms and customs more in harmony with the new\r\nideals take the place of the old. These changes, however, come very\r\ngradually, and should not be hastened, but should only keep pace with\r\nthe new conceptions. Nevertheless, there should not be too tenacious a\r\nclinging to the old forms, which expressed lower conceptions, when the\r\nmasterly thought of the day is forging out higher and purer ideals of\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Wedding Breakfast_\r\n\r\nThe wedding breakfast is the name given to the refreshments which\r\nfollow the noon wedding. It is usually given when there are but few\r\nrelatives and intimate friends, because it is an expensive feast if\r\nlarge numbers are invited. It is really a dinner, served in courses,\r\nat numerous small tables, each with a complete dinner service. One\r\nlarge table, placed in the center of the room or elsewhere\r\nconspicuously, is reserved for the bridal party.\r\n\r\nThe menu usually consists of \"fruit, raw oysters, bouillon, fish or\r\nlobster in some fancy form, an entree, birds and salad, ices, cakes,\r\nbonbons, and coffee,\" according to one recognized authority. Or it may\r\nbe much simpler, and include only oysters or bouillon, sandwiches and\r\nsalad, ices, cakes, and coffee.\r\n\r\nUsually some punch is served in which to pledge the bride and\r\nbridegroom. If wine is used, champagne is customary for weddings.\r\n\r\nThe caterer usually supplies all the necessities for the wedding\r\nfeast, even to china, linen, silver, candelabra, and flowers, should\r\nthe bride's parents so wish.\r\n\r\nAt the wedding reception, after the congratulations and greetings are\r\nover, and the breakfast is announced, the bride and bridegroom lead\r\nthe way to the dining-room. Then comes the bride's father with the\r\ngroom's mother. The bridegroom's father follows with some member of\r\nthe bride's family, then come the best man and the maid of honor. The\r\nushers and bridesmaids pair off, and other members of the bridal party\r\nor of the two families follow in pairs. Lastly, as hostess of the\r\noccasion, comes the bride's mother, with the officiating clergyman, or\r\nthe senior and highest in rank of the clergymen, if there be more than\r\none, as guest of honor.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the guests, who are not seated at the bridal table, find\r\ntheir seats as they choose, with friends, no place cards being used.\r\n\r\nFor an afternoon or evening reception the refreshments are served as\r\nfor any reception. A large table in the dining-room is decorated with\r\nflowers and piled with the edibles, which are served by the waiters to\r\nthe guests as they enter. The variety of food depends wholly upon the\r\nresources of the bride's parents and the size and elaborateness of the\r\nwedding. Many prefer a simple repast as the hour is unusual for a\r\nmeal, and a dinner is not to be served.\r\n\r\nWhen the bride and bridegroom enter and are served, the best man\r\nproposes a toast to their health and happiness, and all present stand,\r\nglass in hand, and pledge them.\r\n\r\nAt a wedding breakfast the English custom is to have toasts and\r\nspeeches, but it is not followed largely in this country. Where it is,\r\nusually at a small wedding party, the father of the bridegroom or the\r\nbest man proposes the health of the bride and bridegroom. The father\r\nof the bride responds. Sometimes the bridegroom is called on to\r\nrespond to this toast, which he does, proposing in turn the health of\r\nthe bridesmaids. To this the best man responds.\r\n\r\nThe wedding cake is a rich dark fruit cake, which is at its best only\r\nwhen made months in advance and kept in a stone crock well covered.\r\nThis is finely frosted and ornamented.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the wedding breakfast the wedding cake is set before\r\nthe bride, who cuts the first slice from it. It is then passed to the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nAt a large wedding, where no breakfast is served, the wedding cake is\r\nusually cut into small pieces and placed in white boxes, which are\r\ndecorated with the initials of the bride and bridegroom and are tied\r\nwith white ribbon. These are placed upon a table in the hall near the\r\ndoor and the guests either each take one as he leaves, or one is\r\nhanded him by a servant.\r\n\r\nSometimes a part of the wedding cake is put away in a tin box and\r\nsealed, to be opened by the couple on some future anniversary.\r\n\r\nThe wedding cake is distinct from the bride's cake, which may be\r\nserved by the latter at a dinner to her bridesmaids a day or more\r\nbefore the wedding, and in which a thimble, a coin, and a ring are\r\nhidden. The superstition is that the young women who by chance receive\r\nthe slices containing these are respectively destined for a future of\r\nsingle blessedness, wealth, or domestic bliss.\r\n\r\nAt a reception the larger number of the guests depart before the\r\nbridal couple go to the dining-room. As soon as refreshments are\r\nserved them, and the toast to them has been drunk, they retire to don\r\nsuits for traveling. The bridegroom waits for the bride at the foot of\r\nthe staircase, and the bridesmaids gather there too, as when she\r\ncomes, she throws her bridal bouquet among them, and the bridesmaid\r\nwho catches it will be the next bride, according to an old\r\nsuperstition.\r\n\r\nAs the outer door is opened to let the couple out, all the friends and\r\nrelatives present throw flowers or confetti or rice after them, for\r\ngood luck, and an old white slipper is thrown after the carriage as\r\nthey drive off. The custom of thus showering the departing couple has\r\nbeen sometimes carried to such an extreme that many refrain from it.\r\nRice is somewhat dangerous, and confetti is so distinctive as\r\nfrequently to cause embarrassment when in a public train or station.\r\nFlowers may appropriately be used, and are always at hand in the\r\ndecorations of the home.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Wedding Journey_\r\n\r\nThe wedding journey is the bride and bridegroom's affair, and the\r\nknowledge of it is kept their secret and divulged only to the best\r\nman, who probably helps arrange for it, and to the father and mother\r\nof the bride, and they all are silent about it. The intrusion of even\r\nintimate friends upon such a trip is not considered good form.\r\n\r\nThe custom of taking a journey at this time is not so rigidly observed\r\nas it used to be, many young couples preferring to go direct to their\r\nnew home, or to a quiet country house for the honeymoon.\r\n\r\nThe real wishes of the couple should be followed out at this time,\r\nbecause they are now more free from social obligations than they will\r\nbe later, and a wise start upon married life is of all things most\r\ndesirable and necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wedding Fee_\r\n\r\nThe fee should be placed in an envelope or purse, and given to the\r\nclergyman by the best man or some friend of the bridegroom, just\r\nbefore or just after the ceremony, as may be most convenient. It is\r\nsometimes handed to the clergyman by the bridegroom at the close of\r\nthe ceremony and before the couple turn away from the altar. It should\r\nbe always given quietly, privately, and with no display or comment.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman does not examine the fee or comment upon it, other than\r\nindicating his acceptance.\r\n\r\nThe size of the fee is a matter of individual taste. Because it is\r\nunostentatiously given, its size is known only to the bridegroom and\r\nthe clergyman, and to none others unless they wish to tell. There are\r\nsome people in fashionable circles who employ a minister only at\r\nmarriages and funerals, and who labor under the impression that they\r\nare objects of charity and that by them even the small favor is always\r\nthankfully received. No one thing so denotes the degree of real\r\nrefinement in a man as the fee he offers the clergyman for marrying\r\nhim. The clergyman is one of the three principals in the marriage\r\nceremony. The great majority of brides desire that their marriage\r\nshould have the sanction and benediction of the religious body with\r\nwhich they worship, or which has standing in their community and among\r\ntheir people. At the very least, in the civil marriage, without a\r\nthird party to represent either church or state a marriage ceremony\r\nand therefore a legalized marriage is impossible. The third principal\r\nis therefore an important part of the affair. To treat him shabbily in\r\nany way denotes no real appreciation of his presence. So it is that\r\nthe true gentleman is as willing to give a handsome fee to him, if his\r\nmeans permit it, as he is to give to his bride something which shall\r\ndelight and please her, and which shall symbolize his appreciation of\r\nthe gift of herself. The bridegroom's offering to the clergyman is\r\nindeed the touchstone of his refinement. Wedding fees vary from five\r\nto a thousand dollars, the usual amount being twenty-five dollars for\r\nthe fairly affluent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wedding Presents_\r\n\r\nSo extreme has become the custom of sending wedding presents that it\r\nis perhaps necessary to remind those who really desire to do the\r\ncorrect thing, that a perfunctory service, or gift, or courtesy has no\r\nintrinsic value, and the omission of it would often be far more\r\nsatisfactory than its bestowal.\r\n\r\nThe usual form of wedding gift is something of use and ornament for\r\nthe new house. Silver, linen, cut glass, or china for the dining-room,\r\nfurniture, rugs, lamps, clocks, vases, books, and pictures, or\r\nbric-a-brac for the rest of the house, are all appropriate.\r\n\r\nIf silver is given, it should not be marked, as the bride may have\r\nduplicates and prefer to exchange some pieces for others, or as she\r\nmay have a special form of engraving which she prefers. The exchange\r\nof a gift, however, removes from it the personal thought of the giver,\r\nand makes its acceptance more a matter of mercenary than of friendly\r\ninterest. If, however, such exchange is made at the suggestion or with\r\nthe approval of the giver, it still remains a personal gift. The\r\nindefinite way in which many people choose wedding gifts for their\r\nfriends, following only the conventional ideas of what is suitable,\r\nhas taken a great deal of personal interest from the gift at the very\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThe wedding gift should be a real gift in spirit, something expressive\r\nof the giver's good wishes, and something which the bride and\r\nbridegroom can enjoy and appreciate for its worth to them. Foolish\r\nthings, whether expensive or not, have no real utility or beauty, and\r\nhave always the atmosphere of insult about them, or else always\r\nreflect upon the intelligence of the giver.\r\n\r\nA bride should acknowledge all gifts as soon as they are received, and\r\nbefore her wedding day if possible. Spontaneous rather than\r\nstereotyped notes of thanks are preferable. They should show\r\nappreciation of the gift, and include the name of the bridegroom-elect\r\nin her expression of their gratitude. A bride should remember that\r\ntoo elaborate notes, which are a grave tax on her strength or time in\r\nthe busy days preceding a wedding, are unwise, as is any other\r\nunnecessary expenditure of energy.\r\n\r\nIt is never obligatory to send a wedding present. The wedding\r\nannouncement and wedding invitation are equally suggestive of such\r\ngifts, for in either case, whether one is invited to the ceremony or\r\nnot, one is perfectly free to do as he pleases about conferring a\r\ngift.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Country Wedding_\r\n\r\nThere is an especial attractiveness and simplicity about the out-door\r\nwedding in the country, for those who desire to get rid of the\r\nconventional and artificial. Such a wedding is, of course, a day\r\nwedding. The late afternoon might be chosen, but the twilight never.\r\nThe weather must be warm.\r\n\r\nA secluded corner in the garden, the shade of some stately tree on the\r\nlawn, or the flowery seclusion of some orchard tree make attractive\r\nchancels for the ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe grass should be cut close, and all leaves and debris swept away.\r\n\r\nSomewhat removed from the place of the ceremony, but still on the lawn\r\nor piazza, small tables and chairs may be placed in groups, and\r\nrefreshments served out of doors also.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity and homelike yet solemn atmosphere of a wedding in a\r\ncountry church appeal to many. There much of the formality of a city\r\nchurch wedding may be dispensed with, and yet the whole of the\r\nreligious spirit, which should attend a church wedding, and indeed any\r\nwedding, be retained. The country church lends itself more aptly to\r\nthose private weddings where the bridal party, whether small or large,\r\nare the only spectators, than does the large city church. The sense of\r\nexclusiveness is preserved without the great sense of bareness and\r\nemptiness.\r\n\r\nTo many the private church wedding appeals with great force. The\r\nreligious and sacramental nature of the ceremony is emphasized,\r\nwithout the pomp and display of the public service. Such a wedding\r\nusually takes place in the daytime rather than in the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nETIQUETTE FOR CHILDREN\r\n\r\n\r\nONE may be taught self-restraint and unselfish consideration for\r\nothers at so early an age that such virtues become habitual, and minor\r\nmaxims are to a large extent unnecessary. Of course, the child will\r\nstill have to be shown the various ways in which he can show\r\nconsideration, but he will quite frequently do of himself those acts\r\nwhich make for the comfort and well-being of others.\r\n\r\nHabits of deference to elders spring from more complex motives, and\r\nthe training in them may have to be more persistent and rigorous. Boys\r\nshould be taught to take off their caps to their elders, both in the\r\nfamily and in the circle of friends, when they meet them on the\r\nstreet. They should rise when ladies enter the room, and remain\r\nstanding until all are seated.\r\n\r\nAn important part in a child's bringing up is to teach him to put away\r\nhis own garments and to clear up after his play or work. If this is\r\ninstilled early into the child, there will never be any need of the\r\npain of counteracting slovenliness, and also never any of that\r\ndisagreeable haughtiness toward servants, which is fostered by nothing\r\nso much as by the inch-by-inch waiting upon a child.\r\n\r\nThe child who has been made a companion of, and not repressed or\r\ndriven away by the older people of the family, has a sort of\r\ninstinctive respect for them, which, though it may overstep itself in\r\nsome daring familiarity occasionally, is the basis of a strong\r\nauthority over him. The child who has been spied on, and whose idea of\r\nall adults is that they are a sort of modified policemen, will show\r\nrespect only under compulsion, and will fail in all those fine\r\ncourtesies which the thoroughly well-bred child grows to delight in.\r\n\r\nSelf-control and self-repression are equal virtues to be cultivated in\r\nthe child. To permit the child to be indifferent and inattentive when\r\none is trying to amuse or entertain, to be impatient to get at the end\r\nof a story or a game, to keep yawning; or making other expressions of\r\nweariness when being reproved or reprimanded, cultivates in the child\r\na mental laziness which is as bad as its opposite,--parrot-like\r\nfacility for chattering and asking questions, which gives a child no\r\nchance to think, and makes him develop into a man of only surface\r\nintelligence and thoughtless flippancy. Even a child can appreciate,\r\nif rightly taught, the motive back of a kind action, and can respect\r\nthat even if the action does not interest him.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is a serious matter to allow a child to be\r\nconstantly bored with lectures on his conduct, or even with efforts to\r\namuse him. He should be let alone, thrown upon his own resources, and\r\nnot permitted to be taxed beyond adult endurance by well-meaning but\r\nfutile efforts on his behalf.\r\n\r\nChildren should never be allowed to interrupt. For that reason\r\nparents, and those who have the care of children, should remember not\r\nto monopolize the conversation when there are children present, nor\r\ntalk on and on for a long time, as no person, least of all a child,\r\ncan follow such continuous talk without weariness.\r\n\r\nChildren should be taught that thinking will answer most of their\r\nquestions for them, that they should wait and see if the answer will\r\nnot be given by something that is said later on. Every effort made to\r\ndrive the thought of a loquacious child back upon itself is an effort\r\nin the right direction; just as every effort made to express and\r\nreveal the thought of an imaginative child is much to the latter's\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nThe sayings of a child should never be quoted in his presence, nor his\r\ndoings related. He becomes hopelessly self-conscious thereby.\r\n\r\nA child should be taught to respect the rights of the father and\r\nmother to the easiest chairs in the room, or those which they may\r\nprefer, and should leave those chairs vacant until the father and\r\nmother are seated elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe boy who has been brought up at home, both by precept and by his\r\nfather's example, never to seat himself at the dining table or in the\r\nfamily sitting-room until his mother is seated, will not need to be\r\ntold that he should rise in a crowded street car and give his seat to\r\nan elderly woman. He will do it so instinctively that it will not be a\r\nburden,--indeed, the regret would be more keen if he could not do it.\r\n\r\nIf children are present at the dining table, it is wiser to help them\r\nfirst, and the grown people last, than the reverse. In everything it\r\nis well to follow the etiquette of adult life, as, for instance, by\r\nhelping the girls before the boys.\r\n\r\nChildren should be taught to be punctual at meals, not simply for the\r\nsake of health, but out of consideration for the cook and for those\r\nwho might otherwise be obliged to wait for them. They should not be\r\nallowed to hurry through a meal because of their impatience to get at\r\nplay, although they may be wisely excused when they are quite through.\r\nThere is no value in making them the bored, squirming, or subdued\r\nlisteners to conversation quite beyond their comprehension or\r\ninterest. They should be taught to eat leisurely, and to regard the\r\nmealtime as a chance to talk with their parents about interesting\r\nthings, and not simply as a time to be shortened and slighted if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nUsually the child's first rigid lesson in punctuality comes at the\r\nbeginning of school life. Then, most profitably, may be cultivated a\r\nsense of the rights of others, and of his individual responsibility\r\ntoward the social group, represented for him by his teacher and\r\nschoolmates. If the emphasis is rightly laid upon the necessity of his\r\nnot delaying the work of his classmates and teacher, he will naturally\r\nfind many ways in which he may apply the same thought, greatly to his\r\nown advantage and to theirs as well, and to the permanent\r\nstrengthening of his habits of work.\r\n\r\nA keen sense of social oneness may also prevent the too frequent\r\nheart-burnings among shy and sensitive children. This is as easily\r\ncultivated as is the opposite, and is of great importance both in\r\nchildhood and in later life. The seeming injustice of the teacher may\r\noften be made clear, and seen to be just, when the welfare of the\r\nwhole school is taken into consideration. This is a matter of the\r\nnatural enlargement of the child's mental horizon, and if the proper\r\nspirit has been fostered, the child will welcome it. Should it be done\r\ncarefully and wisely, the roots of many social weeds will at once be\r\neliminated.\r\n\r\nFault-finding should be discouraged in school and at home. It is never\r\nthe best method of fault correction, and should not be countenanced.\r\n\r\nThe bringing home of tales of the teacher and of schoolmates, in a\r\nspirit of complaint, should not be permitted. Pleasant accounts of\r\nhappenings at school should be encouraged, but grumbling against\r\nrules, as well as personal gossip, should not be permitted. The\r\nauthority of the home must support the authority of the school or the\r\nchild will nowhere receive that discipline and training which he needs\r\nin order to meet the experiences of life.\r\n\r\nThe child should be allowed a certain sum of money, which, even in the\r\nmost lavish homes, should be a little under what the wants of the\r\nchild require. The giving of this money should be done regularly at a\r\nstated time, and there should never be any extra giving, or increase\r\nof the usual sum, except under very unusual circumstances, which\r\nshould not be allowed to happen more than once a year.\r\n\r\nThe child should also be held accountable for his money. If he is old\r\nenough to have any money, or to spend any, he is old enough to tell\r\nhow he spent it, even to the last penny. Unless all is accounted for,\r\nthe habits of accuracy and care are not formed. The record of this\r\nshould be written down, even if done very simply and without special\r\nform, and later, as the child grows older, more conventional forms of\r\nbookkeeping should be required.\r\n\r\nIt should be also required that there be some saving, which is\r\npreferably a certain proportion of the whole, this for a beginning to\r\nwhich to add extra sums as the child may wish. This saved sum should\r\nbe permanently put by, and drawing from it should not be permitted. It\r\nmay be transferred to a bank at long intervals, always by the child\r\nhimself, and his pride in doing it and keeping it there should be\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\nThese matters may all be made a game and sheer fun. Their grave\r\nimportance is apparent on every hand. For the child which has been\r\ntaught early to do these things, will do them with such ease as to\r\nmake it seem instinctive, and the child who does it will never, under\r\nany ordinary circumstances, come to want.\r\n\r\nThe proper behavior in church should be taught rather by trying to\r\ninculcate the spirit of worship than by making rules to be followed. A\r\nchild is very susceptible to impressiveness of any sort, and if the\r\nreason for it is made clear to him, he will be quicker to respond to\r\nit by a reverent attitude of spirit than does an older person. Even\r\nthe obstreperous child is at least temporarily impressed, if he sees\r\nthat others are, and if he knows the reason for it.\r\n\r\nChildren should realize that it is their privilege and duty to serve\r\nguests, whether their own or their parents. The sacrifice of one's own\r\ncomfort for the sake of the guest takes, with a child, the form of a\r\nsort of play, usually because of the excitement of the arrival of a\r\nstranger, and the possibilities of fun in the enjoyment of the\r\nstranger's stay.\r\n\r\nThe child should be taught respect for the guest's person, and should\r\nnot be allowed to take the same liberties with a gown or a glove that\r\nsometimes the mother or aunts permit, no matter how great the novelty\r\nof the texture or how it appeals to the child's sense of beauty. The\r\nprivileges of being a guest should be always duly respected, and the\r\nchild be thus taught at once his duty as a host and his position as a\r\nguest.\r\n\r\nChildren should never be allowed to play with a visitor's hat or cane,\r\nor handle furniture or ornaments in a strange house, or show by\r\nill-mannerly conduct the curiosity which a child, in unaccustomed\r\nsurroundings, naturally feels. They can be taught so great a respect\r\nfor the possessions of others that they would become able to stifle\r\ntheir curiosity, or express it only at a fitting time.\r\n\r\nChildren should not be sent to the drawing-room to entertain\r\nvisitors, unless the visitors request it themselves. Nor should they\r\nbe allowed to be troublesome to visitors or guests at any time, any\r\nmore than servants should be allowed to be insolent. They should never\r\nbe allowed the freedom of the rooms of the guests, nor to visit them\r\noften or long.\r\n\r\nChildren should not be permitted to enter into the pleasures of their\r\nelders when, to do so, would be to spoil the kind of sociability for\r\nwhich the occasion was intended. At all formal functions, children are\r\nout of place. When making formal calls, children are usually in the\r\nway, and the silent part they are forced to play is disagreeable for\r\nthem. They are also out of place at a funeral, or in a cemetery, or\r\nanywhere that there is mourning. It is an injury to a child to see\r\ngrief,--unless it be his great concern, and in that case it is no\r\nlonger a matter of etiquette, but of necessary life experience.\r\n\r\nChildren should not dine out except by special invitation. It is as\r\ndiscourteous to permit a child thoughtlessly to inconvenience a\r\nneighbor, as it is wrong for the child to think that such uninvited\r\nvisits are permissible.\r\n\r\nA child should be taught never to touch what does not belong to it,\r\nexcept with the express permission of the owner. This applies to goods\r\nin a store, as well as to the furniture of places other than his\r\nhome, and to the belongings of others in his home.\r\n\r\nA child should not be allowed to intrude into a drive, a walk, a call,\r\nor a conversation. It is unfair to the child, and awkward for him, and\r\nis no kindness, as it takes away the benefit which he might otherwise\r\nderive from the pleasure either by continually snubbing his\r\nself-respect, or by repressing his energy and curiosity to the danger\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nChildren should not be allowed to go to picnic parties, unless they\r\nhave been invited and entertainment prepared for them.\r\n\r\nChildren should be taught to treat servants with all the politeness\r\nwith which they treat their elders, and with much more consideration.\r\nThe converse of the servants with children should be of the same\r\ncareful and pleasant quality that the best parents use and desire.\r\nThis may well be insisted upon. On the other hand, the children should\r\nbe taught that servants are busy people, that they should never be\r\nimposed upon, and that unnecessary work should not be made for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nETIQUETTE OF MOURNING\r\n\r\n\r\nUPON the occasion of a death in the family a reliable undertaker is at\r\nonce notified and his suggestions followed as to the necessary\r\npreparations to be made for the funeral.\r\n\r\nThe shades are drawn throughout the front of the house, as a sign that\r\nthe family is in retirement. The women of the family are not seen upon\r\nthe street unless necessary, the men taking full charge of all\r\nbusiness matters. The directions which the undertaker desires should\r\nbe decided upon by the family, or nearest relative of the deceased,\r\nand then some one member of the family should be delegated to see that\r\nthey are carried out. Palm leaves tied with ribbon or chiffon, spray\r\nbouquets of white flowers tied with ribbon, an ivy wreath broken with\r\na bunch of purple everlasting, are much preferred to crape upon the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nPress notices of the funeral and death should be sent to the\r\nnewspapers. The conduct of the funeral should be arranged with the\r\nclergyman chosen to officiate, the superintendent of the cemetery\r\nconsulted (usually through the undertaker), and the notes of request\r\nsent to those chosen to act as pallbearers. Sometimes the latter are\r\npurely honorary, the undertaker furnishing the bearers. The honor is\r\nusually given to intimate family friends, or close business associates\r\nin case of a business man.\r\n\r\nA carriage is always provided for the clergyman, and he is entitled to\r\na fee, although clergymen do not charge it, either at a home or church\r\nfuneral. If the service is held at a church, the sexton, organist and\r\nsingers,--and the singers at a home funeral as well,--are entitled to\r\nrecompense for their services.\r\n\r\nCarriages are sent for the pallbearers, and are also provided to\r\nconvey the family, and as many of the friends as may be invited to go,\r\nto the cemetery.\r\n\r\nOne may announce in the newspaper \"Burial private,\" in which case it\r\nis understood that only the family attend at the grave; or \"No\r\nflowers\" if the family wish the usual sending of flowers dispensed\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman usually consults the wishes of the family as to the form\r\nof service, the hymns or music, and remarks. The funeral service\r\nshould be brief, and preferably a ritual service with no sermon or\r\neulogy. The last are usually harrowing to the feelings of the\r\nmourners, and there should be every reasonable effort made to relieve\r\nthe tension of the occasion, for the sake of the living.\r\n\r\nAt a church funeral the pallbearers sit in the first pews at the left\r\nof the center aisle; the family in those to the right. At a home\r\nfuneral it is customary to have the family in some secluded room near\r\nthe one where the coffin is placed and to have the clergyman stand in\r\nthe hall between, or at the entrance of the drawing-room, where he may\r\nbe readily heard by all.\r\n\r\nIf the service at the grave immediately follows the funeral the house\r\nshould meanwhile be aired, the shades lifted, the flowers all sent\r\naway to some hospital, and the rooms arranged in the usual way.\r\n\r\nBefore a funeral at the home, it is necessary for some member of the\r\nfamily to receive the relatives from the distance, and the very\r\nintimate friends, and see that they are given necessary refreshment,\r\nand their return to trains, if they must leave immediately after the\r\nfuneral, thoroughly understood by the hackmen.\r\n\r\nAt a home funeral the singers should be somewhat distant from the\r\nfamily, so that the music is not loud.\r\n\r\nThe members of the family are dressed in hats and veils ready to enter\r\nthe carriages, before the service. They pass to view the body,--if,\r\naccording to a former custom, the casket is left open,--last of all,\r\nand enter the last carriage before that of the pallbearers, which\r\nimmediately precedes the hearse.\r\n\r\nIn sending flowers to a funeral, one's card is enclosed. There should\r\nbe no slightest sense of obligation in the sending of flowers, and\r\neach piece should represent only real sympathy or respect.\r\n\r\nThe putting on of black garments as a sign that one has lost a near\r\nrelative has been much modified by the good sense of the people, and\r\nthe period of mourning shortened, especially in England. In stating\r\nthe accepted mourning custom, the moderate observance of it has been\r\ngiven, both extremes being ignored.\r\n\r\nCrape is the quality of goods most closely allied with mourning. Black\r\ndresses trimmed with black crape are usually worn for the first few\r\nmonths by women who have lost a near relative. The black veil worn by\r\nwidows is now of moderate length, and usually not of the very thick\r\nmaterial which was once in vogue. A ruche of white is now placed just\r\ninside the bonnet, which relieves the black effect somewhat. Black\r\nfurs and sealskins are worn with mourning.\r\n\r\nThe English fashion of six months of the deepest mourning and six\r\nmonths of secondary is meeting with more and more approval in this\r\ncountry, although for a close relative a year is the first period and\r\nsix months the second.\r\n\r\nOne who is in mourning does not appear in society for the first six\r\nmonths; after that it is permissible to attend a concert or musical,\r\nbut not the theater or a reception while severe mourning is worn.\r\n\r\nDuring the mourning period, black-bordered stationery is used. The\r\nborder on paper and envelopes is usually three-eighths of an inch for\r\na close relative and half that for a more distant one, or during the\r\nsecondary period of mourning, if one cares to make the change. The\r\npersonal visiting card has a black border during this time.\r\n\r\nThe handkerchief is bordered with narrow black, or is of\r\nnarrow-bordered, plain, sheer linen.\r\n\r\nFor relatives-in-law it is not customary to put on black, although for\r\na father- or mother-in-law it is customary, in the best society, to\r\ndress nearly as for an own father or mother.\r\n\r\nA widower wears a complete suit of black, white linen, dull-black silk\r\nneckties, dull-black leather shoes, black gloves, and a black ribbon\r\nof broader width upon his hat.\r\n\r\nThe mourning band sewed upon the coat sleeve is a discredited form of\r\nmourning. It does not denote the nearness of the loss, and has only\r\nthe virtue of cheapness for those who cannot afford to show marked\r\nrespect to the dead.\r\n\r\nMen do not observe the custom of withdrawing from society for as long\r\na time as do the women, but usually reappear at the homes of intimate\r\nfriends, at public places of entertainment, and at the club after two\r\nor three months. As long as the mourning band is worn upon the hat,\r\nhowever, no man should attend large and fashionable functions, as\r\ndinner or dancing parties, or the theater.\r\n\r\nAfter six months a woman may resume calling, returning the calls of\r\nthose who called upon her in the early weeks of her bereavement.\r\n\r\nChildren of fifteen years of age and under should not wear mourning.\r\n\r\nThe viewing of the body of the deceased as it lies in the casket is\r\nthe privilege of only the family and the immediate friends, and should\r\nnot be requested by others. Therefore, the casket is now usually\r\nclosed before the funeral service, especially if that be at a church.\r\nIn case of a man in public office, it is sometimes necessary that the\r\nbody should lie in state for certain hours, when the public may pay\r\ntheir respects.\r\n\r\nPunctuality is very necessary in regard to everything connected with a\r\nfuneral service, as the overwrought nerves of those who are sorrowing\r\nshould not be taxed to bear any extra tension.\r\n\r\nWithin ten days after the funeral, a card of thanks for sympathy\r\nshould be sent to all who have called upon the family or sent flowers\r\nor offered their services in any way.\r\n\r\nWhen one is in mourning, one does not attend a wedding reception,\r\nthough one may be present at the ceremony. Black should not be worn.\r\n\r\nMourners announce their return to society by sending out their cards\r\nto friends and acquaintances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nMILITARY, NAVAL, AND FLAG ETIQUETTE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE social usage in respect to military or naval officers follows\r\nordinarily the customs of formal occasions or occasions of state in\r\ncivilian life, or is provided for in the instructions of the army and\r\nthe navy, which the members of those two departments of the service\r\nwould alone be expected to know. There are, however, one or two\r\noccasions where the etiquette of social life is, or may be, modified\r\nby the formalities due to these representatives of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Formal Military Wedding_\r\n\r\nThe church or formal home wedding where the bridegroom and his\r\nattendants are all army men, may have the distinctive feature of the\r\narch of swords or bayonets. The bridegroom and the ushers, in that\r\ncase, are all in full dress uniform. The bride and bridesmaids are\r\ndressed daintily and fluffily to afford contrast. The church should be\r\ndecorated with palms and lilies, and with the national and the\r\nregimental flags in the chancel. As the organist begins the\r\nwedding-march, two color-bearers of the regiment, carrying one the\r\nnational flag and the other the regimental colors, precede the\r\nbridegroom and the best man from the vestry. The latter take their\r\nusual places, and the color-bearers move to a position at either side\r\nof the chancel steps. After the ceremony, they move to the head of the\r\naisle, and the ushers form a line to the foot of the chancel steps.\r\nThe ushers then put on their caps, unsheathe their swords, or raise\r\ntheir bayonets, and form an arch with them. Under this arch pass the\r\nbride and bridegroom, and the bridesmaids. Then, sheathing their\r\nswords and removing their caps, the ushers fall into line at the end\r\nof the procession.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Naval and Yachting Usage_\r\n\r\nWhen one is the guest of the owners or the officers of a yacht, or of\r\nthe officers of a government warship or other large vessel, it is well\r\nto know that in the lading of the gig for reaching and leaving the\r\nship, the order of precedence is always as follows: Juniors in rank or\r\nofficial importance enter the gig first, and the one highest in rank\r\nimmediately precedes the Captain, who is always the last to embark and\r\nthe first to disembark. In leaving the gig, the order is reversed\r\nfrom that on entering it, the junior in rank thus being the last to\r\nleave the boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Etiquette of the Flag_\r\n\r\nThe flag is displayed every day only on government buildings and\r\nschoolhouses. On state holidays, and like commemorative days when it\r\nis customary for the flag to be displayed on private buildings, it\r\nshould be raised at sunrise and lowered at sunset. It should not be\r\ndisplayed on stormy days, nor left out over night. It should never be\r\nallowed to touch the ground. When it is to be displayed at half-mast\r\nonly, it should be raised to the tip of the staff and then lowered\r\nhalfway. It should never be festooned or draped, but always be hung\r\nflat.\r\n\r\nOn Memorial Day, May 30, the flag should be displayed at half-mast\r\nuntil twelve o'clock noon, and then raised to the top of the staff\r\nuntil sunset. The salute for the changing of the position of the flag\r\nat all army posts and stations having artillery, is as follows:\r\nimmediately before noon, the band plays some appropriate air, and at\r\nthe stroke of twelve the national salute of twenty-one guns is fired.\r\nAfter this the flag is hoisted to the peak of the staff, while\r\neverybody stands at attention, with hand raised to the forehead ready\r\nfor the salute. When the colors reach the top, the salute is given,\r\nand the band plays patriotic airs.\r\n\r\nThe salute to the flag is used at its formal raising, and when it\r\npasses on parade or in review. The hand salute according to the\r\nregulations of the United States Army is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Standing at attention, raise the right hand to the forehead over the\r\nright eye, palm downward, fingers extended and close together, arm at\r\nan angle of forty-five degrees. Move hand outward about a foot, with a\r\nquick motion then drop to the side. When the colors are passing on\r\nparade or in review, the spectator should, if walking, halt, if\r\nsitting, arise, and stand at attention and uncover.\"\r\n\r\nIn schools two forms of salute are taught. The first, for primary\r\nchildren, is: \"We give our heads and our hearts to God and our\r\ncountry; one country, one land, one flag.\" The second, for all other\r\npupils, is: \"I pledge allegiance to my flag and to the Republic for\r\nwhich it stands: one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the flag is carried on parade, it is dipped in salute to the\r\nofficial who is reviewing the parade. Whenever the flag is displayed\r\nwith other flags,--whether the colors of a regiment or other military\r\norganization, or of alien nations,--it should be placed, or carried,\r\nor crossed, at the right of the other flag or flags. When portrayed\r\nin illustrations by any process or for any purpose, it is so pictured\r\nthat the staff will always be at the left and the fabric will float to\r\nthe right.\r\n\r\nThe chief regulations governing the composition of the flag are as\r\nfollows: In the _field_ of the flag there should be thirteen\r\nhorizontal stripes, alternating red and white, the first and the last\r\nstripes red. These stripes represent the thirteen original colonies.\r\nThe colors red and white were chosen by George Washington, the red\r\nfrom the flag of England, the Mother Country, broken by the white,\r\nsymbolizing liberty, to show the separation. The _union_ of the\r\nflag--white stars on a field of blue--should be seven stripes high,\r\nand about seven-tenths of the height of the flag in length. \"The stars\r\nshould have five points, with one point directly upward.\"[A] The stars\r\nsymbolize the States. \"By an act of Congress on October 26, 1912, the\r\nflag now has forty-eight stars, arranged in six horizontal rows of\r\neight each.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[A] Turkington, \"My Country\": Chapter XXIII, \"Our Flag.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbreviations, 99, 113, 115\r\n

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n
