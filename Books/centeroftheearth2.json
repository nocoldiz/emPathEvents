The scheme seemed at first impossible: the\r\njourney was a fearfully heavy one, even for a strong horse, at her own\r\nestimate; and she much underrated the distance. It was most venturesome\r\nfor a woman, at night, and alone.\r\n\r\nBut could she go on to Liddy\u2019s and leave things to take their course?\r\nNo, no; anything but that. Bathsheba was full of a stimulating\r\nturbulence, beside which caution vainly prayed for a hearing. She\r\nturned back towards the village.\r\n\r\nHer walk was slow, for she wished not to enter Weatherbury till the\r\ncottagers were in bed, and, particularly, till Boldwood was secure. Her\r\nplan was now to drive to Bath during the night, see Sergeant Troy in\r\nthe morning before he set out to come to her, bid him farewell, and\r\ndismiss him: then to rest the horse thoroughly (herself to weep the\r\nwhile, she thought), starting early the next morning on her return\r\njourney. By this arrangement she could trot Dainty gently all the day,\r\nreach Liddy at Yalbury in the evening, and come home to Weatherbury\r\nwith her whenever they chose\u2014so nobody would know she had been to Bath\r\nat all. Such was Bathsheba\u2019s scheme. But in her topographical ignorance\r\nas a late comer to the place, she misreckoned the distance of her\r\njourney as not much more than half what it really was.\r\n\r\nThis idea she proceeded to carry out, with what initial success we have\r\nalready seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\nIN THE SUN\u2014A HARBINGER\r\n\r\n\r\nA week passed, and there were no tidings of Bathsheba; nor was there\r\nany explanation of her Gilpin\u2019s rig.\r\n\r\nThen a note came for Maryann, stating that the business which had\r\ncalled her mistress to Bath still detained her there; but that she\r\nhoped to return in the course of another week.\r\n\r\nAnother week passed. The oat-harvest began, and all the men were\r\na-field under a monochromatic Lammas sky, amid the trembling air and\r\nshort shadows of noon. Indoors nothing was to be heard save the droning\r\nof blue-bottle flies; out-of-doors the whetting of scythes and the hiss\r\nof tressy oat-ears rubbing together as their perpendicular stalks of\r\namber-yellow fell heavily to each swath. Every drop of moisture not in\r\nthe men\u2019s bottles and flagons in the form of cider was raining as\r\nperspiration from their foreheads and cheeks. Drought was everywhere\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThey were about to withdraw for a while into the charitable shade of a\r\ntree in the fence, when Coggan saw a figure in a blue coat and brass\r\nbuttons running to them across the field.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wonder who that is?\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CI hope nothing is wrong about mistress,\u201D said Maryann, who with some\r\nother women was tying the bundles (oats being always sheafed on this\r\nfarm), \u201Cbut an unlucky token came to me indoors this morning. I went to\r\nunlock the door and dropped the key, and it fell upon the stone floor\r\nand broke into two pieces. Breaking a key is a dreadful bodement. I\r\nwish mis\u2019ess was home.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis Cain Ball,\u201D said Gabriel, pausing from whetting his reaphook.\r\n\r\nOak was not bound by his agreement to assist in the corn-field; but the\r\nharvest month is an anxious time for a farmer, and the corn was\r\nBathsheba\u2019s, so he lent a hand.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s dressed up in his best clothes,\u201D said Matthew Moon. \u201CHe hev been\r\naway from home for a few days, since he\u2019s had that felon upon his\r\nfinger; for \u2019a said, since I can\u2019t work I\u2019ll have a hollerday.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA good time for one\u2014a\u2019 excellent time,\u201D said Joseph Poorgrass,\r\nstraightening his back; for he, like some of the others, had a way of\r\nresting a while from his labour on such hot days for reasons\r\npreternaturally small; of which Cain Ball\u2019s advent on a week-day in his\r\nSunday-clothes was one of the first magnitude. \u201C\u2019Twas a bad leg allowed\r\nme to read the _Pilgrim\u2019s Progress_, and Mark Clark learnt All-Fours in\r\na whitlow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, and my father put his arm out of joint to have time to go\r\ncourting,\u201D said Jan Coggan, in an eclipsing tone, wiping his face with\r\nhis shirt-sleeve and thrusting back his hat upon the nape of his neck.\r\n\r\nBy this time Cainy was nearing the group of harvesters, and was\r\nperceived to be carrying a large slice of bread and ham in one hand,\r\nfrom which he took mouthfuls as he ran, the other being wrapped in a\r\nbandage. When he came close, his mouth assumed the bell shape, and he\r\nbegan to cough violently.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, Cainy!\u201D said Gabriel, sternly. \u201CHow many more times must I tell\r\nyou to keep from running so fast when you be eating? You\u2019ll choke\r\nyourself some day, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll do, Cain Ball.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHok-hok-hok!\u201D replied Cain. \u201CA crumb of my victuals went the wrong\r\nway\u2014hok-hok! That\u2019s what \u2019tis, Mister Oak! And I\u2019ve been visiting to\r\nBath because I had a felon on my thumb; yes, and I\u2019ve seen\u2014ahok-hok!\u201D\r\n\r\nDirectly Cain mentioned Bath, they all threw down their hooks and forks\r\nand drew round him. Unfortunately the erratic crumb did not improve his\r\nnarrative powers, and a supplementary hindrance was that of a sneeze,\r\njerking from his pocket his rather large watch, which dangled in front\r\nof the young man pendulum-wise.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D he continued, directing his thoughts to Bath and letting his\r\neyes follow, \u201CI\u2019ve seed the world at last\u2014yes\u2014and I\u2019ve seed our\r\nmis\u2019ess\u2014ahok-hok-hok!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBother the boy!\u201D said Gabriel. \u201CSomething is always going the wrong\r\nway down your throat, so that you can\u2019t tell what\u2019s necessary to be\r\ntold.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAhok! there! Please, Mister Oak, a gnat have just fleed into my\r\nstomach and brought the cough on again!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, that\u2019s just it. Your mouth is always open, you young rascal!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis terrible bad to have a gnat fly down yer throat, pore boy!\u201D said\r\nMatthew Moon.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, at Bath you saw\u2014\u201D prompted Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CI saw our mistress,\u201D continued the junior shepherd, \u201Cand a sojer,\r\nwalking along. And bymeby they got closer and closer, and then they\r\nwent arm-in-crook, like courting complete\u2014hok-hok! like courting\r\ncomplete\u2014hok!\u2014courting complete\u2014\u201D Losing the thread of his narrative at\r\nthis point simultaneously with his loss of breath, their informant\r\nlooked up and down the field apparently for some clue to it. \u201CWell, I\r\nsee our mis\u2019ess and a soldier\u2014a-ha-a-wk!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDamn the boy!\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis only my manner, Mister Oak, if ye\u2019ll excuse it,\u201D said Cain Ball,\r\nlooking reproachfully at Oak, with eyes drenched in their own dew.\r\n\r\n\u201CHere\u2019s some cider for him\u2014that\u2019ll cure his throat,\u201D said Jan Coggan,\r\nlifting a flagon of cider, pulling out the cork, and applying the hole\r\nto Cainy\u2019s mouth; Joseph Poorgrass in the meantime beginning to think\r\napprehensively of the serious consequences that would follow Cainy\r\nBall\u2019s strangulation in his cough, and the history of his Bath\r\nadventures dying with him.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor my poor self, I always say \u2018please God\u2019 afore I do anything,\u201D said\r\nJoseph, in an unboastful voice; \u201Cand so should you, Cain Ball. \u2019Tis a\r\ngreat safeguard, and might perhaps save you from being choked to death\r\nsome day.\u201D\r\n\r\nMr. Coggan poured the liquor with unstinted liberality at the suffering\r\nCain\u2019s circular mouth; half of it running down the side of the flagon,\r\nand half of what reached his mouth running down outside his throat, and\r\nhalf of what ran in going the wrong way, and being coughed and sneezed\r\naround the persons of the gathered reapers in the form of a cider fog,\r\nwhich for a moment hung in the sunny air like a small exhalation.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a great clumsy sneeze! Why can\u2019t ye have better manners, you\r\nyoung dog!\u201D said Coggan, withdrawing the flagon.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe cider went up my nose!\u201D cried Cainy, as soon as he could speak;\r\n\u201Cand now \u2019tis gone down my neck, and into my poor dumb felon, and over\r\nmy shiny buttons and all my best cloze!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe poor lad\u2019s cough is terrible unfortunate,\u201D said Matthew Moon. \u201CAnd\r\na great history on hand, too. Bump his back, shepherd.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis my nater,\u201D mourned Cain. \u201CMother says I always was so excitable\r\nwhen my feelings were worked up to a point!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue, true,\u201D said Joseph Poorgrass. \u201CThe Balls were always a very\r\nexcitable family. I knowed the boy\u2019s grandfather\u2014a truly nervous and\r\nmodest man, even to genteel refinery. \u2019Twas blush, blush with him,\r\nalmost as much as \u2019tis with me\u2014not but that \u2019tis a fault in me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot at all, Master Poorgrass,\u201D said Coggan. \u201C\u2019Tis a very noble quality\r\nin ye.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHeh-heh! well, I wish to noise nothing abroad\u2014nothing at all,\u201D\r\nmurmured Poorgrass, diffidently. \u201CBut we be born to things\u2014that\u2019s true.\r\nYet I would rather my trifle were hid; though, perhaps, a high nater is\r\na little high, and at my birth all things were possible to my Maker,\r\nand he may have begrudged no gifts.... But under your bushel, Joseph!\r\nunder your bushel with \u2019ee! A strange desire, neighbours, this desire\r\nto hide, and no praise due. Yet there is a Sermon on the Mount with a\r\ncalendar of the blessed at the head, and certain meek men may be named\r\ntherein.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCainy\u2019s grandfather was a very clever man,\u201D said Matthew Moon.\r\n\u201CInvented a\u2019 apple-tree out of his own head, which is called by his\r\nname to this day\u2014the Early Ball. You know \u2019em, Jan? A Quarrenden\r\ngrafted on a Tom Putt, and a Rathe-ripe upon top o\u2019 that again. \u2019Tis\r\ntrew \u2019a used to bide about in a public-house wi\u2019 a \u2019ooman in a way he\r\nhad no business to by rights, but there\u2014\u2019a were a clever man in the\r\nsense of the term.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow then,\u201D said Gabriel, impatiently, \u201Cwhat did you see, Cain?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI seed our mis\u2019ess go into a sort of a park place, where there\u2019s\r\nseats, and shrubs and flowers, arm-in-crook with a sojer,\u201D continued\r\nCainy, firmly, and with a dim sense that his words were very effective\r\nas regarded Gabriel\u2019s emotions. \u201CAnd I think the sojer was Sergeant\r\nTroy. And they sat there together for more than half-an-hour, talking\r\nmoving things, and she once was crying a\u2019most to death. And when they\r\ncame out her eyes were shining and she was as white as a lily; and they\r\nlooked into one another\u2019s faces, as far-gone friendly as a man and\r\nwoman can be.\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel\u2019s features seemed to get thinner. \u201CWell, what did you see\r\nbesides?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, all sorts.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhite as a lily? You are sure \u2019twas she?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, what besides?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGreat glass windows to the shops, and great clouds in the sky, full of\r\nrain, and old wooden trees in the country round.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou stun-poll! What will ye say next?\u201D said Coggan.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet en alone,\u201D interposed Joseph Poorgrass. \u201CThe boy\u2019s meaning is that\r\nthe sky and the earth in the kingdom of Bath is not altogether\r\ndifferent from ours here. \u2019Tis for our good to gain knowledge of\r\nstrange cities, and as such the boy\u2019s words should be suffered, so to\r\nspeak it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd the people of Bath,\u201D continued Cain, \u201Cnever need to light their\r\nfires except as a luxury, for the water springs up out of the earth\r\nready boiled for use.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis true as the light,\u201D testified Matthew Moon. \u201CI\u2019ve heard other\r\nnavigators say the same thing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey drink nothing else there,\u201D said Cain, \u201Cand seem to enjoy it, to\r\nsee how they swaller it down.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, it seems a barbarian practice enough to us, but I daresay the\r\nnatives think nothing o\u2019 it,\u201D said Matthew.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd don\u2019t victuals spring up as well as drink?\u201D asked Coggan, twirling\r\nhis eye.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo\u2014I own to a blot there in Bath\u2014a true blot. God didn\u2019t provide \u2019em\r\nwith victuals as well as drink, and \u2019twas a drawback I couldn\u2019t get\r\nover at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, \u2019tis a curious place, to say the least,\u201D observed Moon; \u201Cand it\r\nmust be a curious people that live therein.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMiss Everdene and the soldier were walking about together, you say?\u201D\r\nsaid Gabriel, returning to the group.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, and she wore a beautiful gold-colour silk gown, trimmed with black\r\nlace, that would have stood alone \u2019ithout legs inside if required.\r\n\u2019Twas a very winsome sight; and her hair was brushed splendid. And when\r\nthe sun shone upon the bright gown and his red coat\u2014my! how handsome\r\nthey looked. You could see \u2019em all the length of the street.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what then?\u201D murmured Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd then I went into Griffin\u2019s to hae my boots hobbed, and then I went\r\nto Riggs\u2019s batty-cake shop, and asked \u2019em for a penneth of the cheapest\r\nand nicest stales, that were all but blue-mouldy, but not quite. And\r\nwhilst I was chawing \u2019em down I walked on and seed a clock with a face\r\nas big as a baking trendle\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut that\u2019s nothing to do with mistress!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m coming to that, if you\u2019ll leave me alone, Mister Oak!\u201D\r\nremonstrated Cainy. \u201CIf you excites me, perhaps you\u2019ll bring on my\r\ncough, and then I shan\u2019t be able to tell ye nothing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014let him tell it his own way,\u201D said Coggan.\r\n\r\nGabriel settled into a despairing attitude of patience, and Cainy went\r\non:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd there were great large houses, and more people all the week long\r\nthan at Weatherbury club-walking on White Tuesdays. And I went to grand\r\nchurches and chapels. And how the parson would pray! Yes; he would\r\nkneel down and put up his hands together, and make the holy gold rings\r\non his fingers gleam and twinkle in yer eyes, that he\u2019d earned by\r\npraying so excellent well!\u2014Ah yes, I wish I lived there.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COur poor Parson Thirdly can\u2019t get no money to buy such rings,\u201D said\r\nMatthew Moon, thoughtfully. \u201CAnd as good a man as ever walked. I don\u2019t\r\nbelieve poor Thirdly have a single one, even of humblest tin or copper.\r\nSuch a great ornament as they\u2019d be to him on a dull afternoon, when\r\nhe\u2019s up in the pulpit lighted by the wax candles! But \u2019tis impossible,\r\npoor man. Ah, to think how unequal things be.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps he\u2019s made of different stuff than to wear \u2019em,\u201D said Gabriel,\r\ngrimly. \u201CWell, that\u2019s enough of this. Go on, Cainy\u2014quick.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh\u2014and the new style of parsons wear moustaches and long beards,\u201D\r\ncontinued the illustrious traveller, \u201Cand look like Moses and Aaron\r\ncomplete, and make we fokes in the congregation feel all over like the\r\nchildren of Israel.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA very right feeling\u2014very,\u201D said Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd there\u2019s two religions going on in the nation now\u2014High Church and\r\nHigh Chapel. And, thinks I, I\u2019ll play fair; so I went to High Church in\r\nthe morning, and High Chapel in the afternoon.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA right and proper boy,\u201D said Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, at High Church they pray singing, and worship all the colours of\r\nthe rainbow; and at High Chapel they pray preaching, and worship drab\r\nand whitewash only. And then\u2014I didn\u2019t see no more of Miss Everdene at\r\nall.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy didn\u2019t you say so afore, then?\u201D exclaimed Oak, with much\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh,\u201D said Matthew Moon, \u201Cshe\u2019ll wish her cake dough if so be she\u2019s\r\nover intimate with that man.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s not over intimate with him,\u201D said Gabriel, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe would know better,\u201D said Coggan. \u201COur mis\u2019ess has too much sense\r\nunder they knots of black hair to do such a mad thing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou see, he\u2019s not a coarse, ignorant man, for he was well brought up,\u201D\r\nsaid Matthew, dubiously. \u201C\u2019Twas only wildness that made him a soldier,\r\nand maids rather like your man of sin.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, Cain Ball,\u201D said Gabriel restlessly, \u201Ccan you swear in the most\r\nawful form that the woman you saw was Miss Everdene?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCain Ball, you be no longer a babe and suckling,\u201D said Joseph in the\r\nsepulchral tone the circumstances demanded, \u201Cand you know what taking\r\nan oath is. \u2019Tis a horrible testament mind ye, which you say and seal\r\nwith your blood-stone, and the prophet Matthew tells us that on\r\nwhomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder. Now, before all\r\nthe work-folk here assembled, can you swear to your words as the\r\nshepherd asks ye?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPlease no, Mister Oak!\u201D said Cainy, looking from one to the other with\r\ngreat uneasiness at the spiritual magnitude of the position. \u201CI don\u2019t\r\nmind saying \u2019tis true, but I don\u2019t like to say \u2019tis damn true, if\r\nthat\u2019s what you mane.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCain, Cain, how can you!\u201D asked Joseph sternly. \u201CYou be asked to swear\r\nin a holy manner, and you swear like wicked Shimei, the son of Gera,\r\nwho cursed as he came. Young man, fie!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, I don\u2019t! \u2019Tis you want to squander a pore boy\u2019s soul, Joseph\r\nPoorgrass\u2014that\u2019s what \u2019tis!\u201D said Cain, beginning to cry. \u201CAll I mane\r\nis that in common truth \u2019twas Miss Everdene and Sergeant Troy, but in\r\nthe horrible so-help-me truth that ye want to make of it perhaps \u2019twas\r\nsomebody else!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s no getting at the rights of it,\u201D said Gabriel, turning to his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\u201CCain Ball, you\u2019ll come to a bit of bread!\u201D groaned Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\nThen the reapers\u2019 hooks were flourished again, and the old sounds went\r\non. Gabriel, without making any pretence of being lively, did nothing\r\nto show that he was particularly dull. However, Coggan knew pretty\r\nnearly how the land lay, and when they were in a nook together he said\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t take on about her, Gabriel. What difference does it make whose\r\nsweetheart she is, since she can\u2019t be yours?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s the very thing I say to myself,\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\nHOME AGAIN\u2014A TRICKSTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same evening at dusk Gabriel was leaning over Coggan\u2019s\r\ngarden-gate, taking an up-and-down survey before retiring to rest.\r\n\r\nA vehicle of some kind was softly creeping along the grassy margin of\r\nthe lane. From it spread the tones of two women talking. The tones were\r\nnatural and not at all suppressed. Oak instantly knew the voices to be\r\nthose of Bathsheba and Liddy.\r\n\r\nThe carriage came opposite and passed by. It was Miss Everdene\u2019s gig,\r\nand Liddy and her mistress were the only occupants of the seat. Liddy\r\nwas asking questions about the city of Bath, and her companion was\r\nanswering them listlessly and unconcernedly. Both Bathsheba and the\r\nhorse seemed weary.\r\n\r\nThe exquisite relief of finding that she was here again, safe and\r\nsound, overpowered all reflection, and Oak could only luxuriate in the\r\nsense of it. All grave reports were forgotten.\r\n\r\nHe lingered and lingered on, till there was no difference between the\r\neastern and western expanses of sky, and the timid hares began to limp\r\ncourageously round the dim hillocks. Gabriel might have been there an\r\nadditional half-hour when a dark form walked slowly by. \u201CGood-night,\r\nGabriel,\u201D the passer said.\r\n\r\nIt was Boldwood. \u201CGood-night, sir,\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\nBoldwood likewise vanished up the road, and Oak shortly afterwards\r\nturned indoors to bed.\r\n\r\nFarmer Boldwood went on towards Miss Everdene\u2019s house. He reached the\r\nfront, and approaching the entrance, saw a light in the parlour. The\r\nblind was not drawn down, and inside the room was Bathsheba, looking\r\nover some papers or letters. Her back was towards Boldwood. He went to\r\nthe door, knocked, and waited with tense muscles and an aching brow.\r\n\r\nBoldwood had not been outside his garden since his meeting with\r\nBathsheba in the road to Yalbury. Silent and alone, he had remained in\r\nmoody meditation on woman\u2019s ways, deeming as essentials of the whole\r\nsex the accidents of the single one of their number he had ever closely\r\nbeheld. By degrees a more charitable temper had pervaded him, and this\r\nwas the reason of his sally to-night. He had come to apologize and beg\r\nforgiveness of Bathsheba with something like a sense of shame at his\r\nviolence, having but just now learnt that she had returned\u2014only from a\r\nvisit to Liddy, as he supposed, the Bath escapade being quite unknown\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nHe inquired for Miss Everdene. Liddy\u2019s manner was odd, but he did not\r\nnotice it. She went in, leaving him standing there, and in her absence\r\nthe blind of the room containing Bathsheba was pulled down. Boldwood\r\naugured ill from that sign. Liddy came out.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy mistress cannot see you, sir,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\nThe farmer instantly went out by the gate. He was unforgiven\u2014that was\r\nthe issue of it all. He had seen her who was to him simultaneously a\r\ndelight and a torture, sitting in the room he had shared with her as a\r\npeculiarly privileged guest only a little earlier in the summer, and\r\nshe had denied him an entrance there now.\r\n\r\nBoldwood did not hurry homeward. It was ten o\u2019clock at least, when,\r\nwalking deliberately through the lower part of Weatherbury, he heard\r\nthe carrier\u2019s spring van entering the village. The van ran to and from\r\na town in a northern direction, and it was owned and driven by a\r\nWeatherbury man, at the door of whose house it now pulled up. The lamp\r\nfixed to the head of the hood illuminated a scarlet and gilded form,\r\nwho was the first to alight.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D said Boldwood to himself, \u201Ccome to see her again.\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy entered the carrier\u2019s house, which had been the place of his\r\nlodging on his last visit to his native place. Boldwood was moved by a\r\nsudden determination. He hastened home. In ten minutes he was back\r\nagain, and made as if he were going to call upon Troy at the carrier\u2019s.\r\nBut as he approached, some one opened the door and came out. He heard\r\nthis person say \u201CGood-night\u201D to the inmates, and the voice was Troy\u2019s.\r\nThis was strange, coming so immediately after his arrival. Boldwood,\r\nhowever, hastened up to him. Troy had what appeared to be a carpet-bag\r\nin his hand\u2014the same that he had brought with him. It seemed as if he\r\nwere going to leave again this very night.\r\n\r\nTroy turned up the hill and quickened his pace. Boldwood stepped\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\u201CSergeant Troy?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014I\u2019m Sergeant Troy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CJust arrived from up the country, I think?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CJust arrived from Bath.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am William Boldwood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe tone in which this word was uttered was all that had been wanted to\r\nbring Boldwood to the point.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish to speak a word with you,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat about?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAbout her who lives just ahead there\u2014and about a woman you have\r\nwronged.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wonder at your impertinence,\u201D said Troy, moving on.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow look here,\u201D said Boldwood, standing in front of him, \u201Cwonder or\r\nnot, you are going to hold a conversation with me.\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy heard the dull determination in Boldwood\u2019s voice, looked at his\r\nstalwart frame, then at the thick cudgel he carried in his hand. He\r\nremembered it was past ten o\u2019clock. It seemed worth while to be civil\r\nto Boldwood.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well, I\u2019ll listen with pleasure,\u201D said Troy, placing his bag on\r\nthe ground, \u201Conly speak low, for somebody or other may overhear us in\r\nthe farmhouse there.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell then\u2014I know a good deal concerning your Fanny Robin\u2019s attachment\r\nto you. I may say, too, that I believe I am the only person in the\r\nvillage, excepting Gabriel Oak, who does know it. You ought to marry\r\nher.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI suppose I ought. Indeed, I wish to, but I cannot.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy was about to utter something hastily; he then checked himself and\r\nsaid, \u201CI am too poor.\u201D His voice was changed. Previously it had had a\r\ndevil-may-care tone. It was the voice of a trickster now.\r\n\r\nBoldwood\u2019s present mood was not critical enough to notice tones. He\r\ncontinued, \u201CI may as well speak plainly; and understand, I don\u2019t wish\r\nto enter into the questions of right or wrong, woman\u2019s honour and\r\nshame, or to express any opinion on your conduct. I intend a business\r\ntransaction with you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI see,\u201D said Troy. \u201CSuppose we sit down here.\u201D\r\n\r\nAn old tree trunk lay under the hedge immediately opposite, and they\r\nsat down.\r\n\r\n\u201CI was engaged to be married to Miss Everdene,\u201D said Boldwood, \u201Cbut you\r\ncame and\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot engaged,\u201D said Troy.\r\n\r\n\u201CAs good as engaged.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I had not turned up she might have become engaged to you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHang might!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWould, then.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you had not come I should certainly\u2014yes, _certainly_\u2014have been\r\naccepted by this time. If you had not seen her you might have been\r\nmarried to Fanny. Well, there\u2019s too much difference between Miss\r\nEverdene\u2019s station and your own for this flirtation with her ever to\r\nbenefit you by ending in marriage. So all I ask is, don\u2019t molest her\r\nany more. Marry Fanny. I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow will you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll pay you well now, I\u2019ll settle a sum of money upon her, and I\u2019ll\r\nsee that you don\u2019t suffer from poverty in the future. I\u2019ll put it\r\nclearly. Bathsheba is only playing with you: you are too poor for her\r\nas I said; so give up wasting your time about a great match you\u2019ll\r\nnever make for a moderate and rightful match you may make to-morrow;\r\ntake up your carpet-bag, turn about, leave Weatherbury now, this night,\r\nand you shall take fifty pounds with you. Fanny shall have fifty to\r\nenable her to prepare for the wedding, when you have told me where she\r\nis living, and she shall have five hundred paid down on her\r\nwedding-day.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn making this statement Boldwood\u2019s voice revealed only too clearly a\r\nconsciousness of the weakness of his position, his aims, and his\r\nmethod. His manner had lapsed quite from that of the firm and dignified\r\nBoldwood of former times; and such a scheme as he had now engaged in he\r\nwould have condemned as childishly imbecile only a few months ago. We\r\ndiscern a grand force in the lover which he lacks whilst a free man;\r\nbut there is a breadth of vision in the free man which in the lover we\r\nvainly seek. Where there is much bias there must be some narrowness,\r\nand love, though added emotion, is subtracted capacity. Boldwood\r\nexemplified this to an abnormal degree: he knew nothing of Fanny\r\nRobin\u2019s circumstances or whereabouts, he knew nothing of Troy\u2019s\r\npossibilities, yet that was what he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CI like Fanny best,\u201D said Troy; \u201Cand if, as you say, Miss Everdene is\r\nout of my reach, why I have all to gain by accepting your money, and\r\nmarrying Fan. But she\u2019s only a servant.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever mind\u2014do you agree to my arrangement?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D said Boldwood, in a more elastic voice. \u201COh, Troy, if you like\r\nher best, why then did you step in here and injure my happiness?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI love Fanny best now,\u201D said Troy. \u201CBut Bathsh\u2014Miss Everdene inflamed\r\nme, and displaced Fanny for a time. It is over now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy should it be over so soon? And why then did you come here again?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere are weighty reasons. Fifty pounds at once, you said!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI did,\u201D said Boldwood, \u201Cand here they are\u2014fifty sovereigns.\u201D He handed\r\nTroy a small packet.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou have everything ready\u2014it seems that you calculated on my accepting\r\nthem,\u201D said the sergeant, taking the packet.\r\n\r\n\u201CI thought you might accept them,\u201D said Boldwood.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve only my word that the programme shall be adhered to, whilst I\r\nat any rate have fifty pounds.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI had thought of that, and I have considered that if I can\u2019t appeal to\r\nyour honour I can trust to your\u2014well, shrewdness we\u2019ll call it\u2014not to\r\nlose five hundred pounds in prospect, and also make a bitter enemy of a\r\nman who is willing to be an extremely useful friend.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CStop, listen!\u201D said Troy in a whisper.\r\n\r\nA light pit-pat was audible upon the road just above them.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy George\u2014\u2019tis she,\u201D he continued. \u201CI must go on and meet her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2014who?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBathsheba.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBathsheba\u2014out alone at this time o\u2019 night!\u201D said Boldwood in\r\namazement, and starting up. \u201CWhy must you meet her?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe was expecting me to-night\u2014and I must now speak to her, and wish\r\nher good-bye, according to your wish.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t see the necessity of speaking.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt can do no harm\u2014and she\u2019ll be wandering about looking for me if I\r\ndon\u2019t. You shall hear all I say to her. It will help you in your\r\nlove-making when I am gone.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYour tone is mocking.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh no. And remember this, if she does not know what has become of me,\r\nshe will think more about me than if I tell her flatly I have come to\r\ngive her up.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you confine your words to that one point?\u2014Shall I hear every word\r\nyou say?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEvery word. Now sit still there, and hold my carpet bag for me, and\r\nmark what you hear.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe light footstep came closer, halting occasionally, as if the walker\r\nlistened for a sound. Troy whistled a double note in a soft, fluty\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome to that, is it!\u201D murmured Boldwood, uneasily.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou promised silence,\u201D said Troy.\r\n\r\n\u201CI promise again.\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy stepped forward.\r\n\r\n\u201CFrank, dearest, is that you?\u201D The tones were Bathsheba\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\u201CO God!\u201D said Boldwood.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Troy to her.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow late you are,\u201D she continued, tenderly. \u201CDid you come by the\r\ncarrier? I listened and heard his wheels entering the village, but it\r\nwas some time ago, and I had almost given you up, Frank.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI was sure to come,\u201D said Frank. \u201CYou knew I should, did you not?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I thought you would,\u201D she said, playfully; \u201Cand, Frank, it is so\r\nlucky! There\u2019s not a soul in my house but me to-night. I\u2019ve packed them\r\nall off so nobody on earth will know of your visit to your lady\u2019s\r\nbower. Liddy wanted to go to her grandfather\u2019s to tell him about her\r\nholiday, and I said she might stay with them till to-morrow\u2014when you\u2019ll\r\nbe gone again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCapital,\u201D said Troy. \u201CBut, dear me, I had better go back for my bag,\r\nbecause my slippers and brush and comb are in it; you run home whilst I\r\nfetch it, and I\u2019ll promise to be in your parlour in ten minutes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D She turned and tripped up the hill again.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of this dialogue there was a nervous twitching of\r\nBoldwood\u2019s tightly closed lips, and his face became bathed in a clammy\r\ndew. He now started forward towards Troy. Troy turned to him and took\r\nup the bag.\r\n\r\n\u201CShall I tell her I have come to give her up and cannot marry her?\u201D\r\nsaid the soldier, mockingly.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no; wait a minute. I want to say more to you\u2014more to you!\u201D said\r\nBoldwood, in a hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow,\u201D said Troy, \u201Cyou see my dilemma. Perhaps I am a bad man\u2014the\r\nvictim of my impulses\u2014led away to do what I ought to leave undone. I\r\ncan\u2019t, however, marry them both. And I have two reasons for choosing\r\nFanny. First, I like her best upon the whole, and second, you make it\r\nworth my while.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt the same instant Boldwood sprang upon him, and held him by the neck.\r\nTroy felt Boldwood\u2019s grasp slowly tightening. The move was absolutely\r\nunexpected.\r\n\r\n\u201CA moment,\u201D he gasped. \u201CYou are injuring her you love!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, what do you mean?\u201D said the farmer.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive me breath,\u201D said Troy.\r\n\r\nBoldwood loosened his hand, saying, \u201CBy Heaven, I\u2019ve a mind to kill\r\nyou!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd ruin her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSave her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, how can she be saved now, unless I marry her?\u201D\r\n\r\nBoldwood groaned. He reluctantly released the soldier, and flung him\r\nback against the hedge. \u201CDevil, you torture me!\u201D said he.\r\n\r\nTroy rebounded like a ball, and was about to make a dash at the farmer;\r\nbut he checked himself, saying lightly\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is not worth while to measure my strength with you. Indeed it is a\r\nbarbarous way of settling a quarrel. I shall shortly leave the army\r\nbecause of the same conviction. Now after that revelation of how the\r\nland lies with Bathsheba, \u2019twould be a mistake to kill me, would it\r\nnot?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Twould be a mistake to kill you,\u201D repeated Boldwood, mechanically,\r\nwith a bowed head.\r\n\r\n\u201CBetter kill yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFar better.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m glad you see it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTroy, make her your wife, and don\u2019t act upon what I arranged just now.\r\nThe alternative is dreadful, but take Bathsheba; I give her up! She\r\nmust love you indeed to sell soul and body to you so utterly as she has\r\ndone. Wretched woman\u2014deluded woman\u2014you are, Bathsheba!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut about Fanny?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBathsheba is a woman well to do,\u201D continued Boldwood, in nervous\r\nanxiety, \u201Cand, Troy, she will make a good wife; and, indeed, she is\r\nworth your hastening on your marriage with her!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut she has a will\u2014not to say a temper, and I shall be a mere slave to\r\nher. I could do anything with poor Fanny Robin.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTroy,\u201D said Boldwood, imploringly, \u201CI\u2019ll do anything for you, only\r\ndon\u2019t desert her; pray don\u2019t desert her, Troy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhich, poor Fanny?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; Bathsheba Everdene. Love her best! Love her tenderly! How shall I\r\nget you to see how advantageous it will be to you to secure her at\r\nonce?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t wish to secure her in any new way.\u201D\r\n\r\nBoldwood\u2019s arm moved spasmodically towards Troy\u2019s person again. He\r\nrepressed the instinct, and his form drooped as with pain.\r\n\r\nTroy went on\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CI shall soon purchase my discharge, and then\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I wish you to hasten on this marriage! It will be better for you\r\nboth. You love each other, and you must let me help you to do it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, by settling the five hundred on Bathsheba instead of Fanny, to\r\nenable you to marry at once. No; she wouldn\u2019t have it of me. I\u2019ll pay\r\nit down to you on the wedding-day.\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy paused in secret amazement at Boldwood\u2019s wild infatuation. He\r\ncarelessly said, \u201CAnd am I to have anything now?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, if you wish to. But I have not much additional money with me. I\r\ndid not expect this; but all I have is yours.\u201D\r\n\r\nBoldwood, more like a somnambulist than a wakeful man, pulled out the\r\nlarge canvas bag he carried by way of a purse, and searched it.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have twenty-one pounds more with me,\u201D he said. \u201CTwo notes and a\r\nsovereign. But before I leave you I must have a paper signed\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPay me the money, and we\u2019ll go straight to her parlour, and make any\r\narrangement you please to secure my compliance with your wishes. But\r\nshe must know nothing of this cash business.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNothing, nothing,\u201D said Boldwood, hastily. \u201CHere is the sum, and if\r\nyou\u2019ll come to my house we\u2019ll write out the agreement for the\r\nremainder, and the terms also.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFirst we\u2019ll call upon her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut why? Come with me to-night, and go with me to-morrow to the\r\nsurrogate\u2019s.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut she must be consulted; at any rate informed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well; go on.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey went up the hill to Bathsheba\u2019s house. When they stood at the\r\nentrance, Troy said, \u201CWait here a moment.\u201D Opening the door, he glided\r\ninside, leaving the door ajar.\r\n\r\nBoldwood waited. In two minutes a light appeared in the passage.\r\nBoldwood then saw that the chain had been fastened across the door.\r\nTroy appeared inside, carrying a bedroom candlestick.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat, did you think I should break in?\u201D said Boldwood, contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, no, it is merely my humour to secure things. Will you read this a\r\nmoment? I\u2019ll hold the light.\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy handed a folded newspaper through the slit between door and\r\ndoorpost, and put the candle close. \u201CThat\u2019s the paragraph,\u201D he said,\r\nplacing his finger on a line.\r\n\r\nBoldwood looked and read\u2014\r\n\r\nMARRIAGES.\r\nOn the 17th inst., at St. Ambrose\u2019s Church, Bath, by the Rev. G.\r\nMincing, B.A., Francis Troy, only son of the late Edward Troy, Esq.,\r\nM.D., of Weatherbury, and sergeant with Dragoon Guards, to Bathsheba,\r\nonly surviving daughter of the late Mr. John Everdene, of Casterbridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CThis may be called Fort meeting Feeble, hey, Boldwood?\u201D said Troy. A\r\nlow gurgle of derisive laughter followed the words.\r\n\r\nThe paper fell from Boldwood\u2019s hands. Troy continued\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CFifty pounds to marry Fanny. Good. Twenty-one pounds not to marry\r\nFanny, but Bathsheba. Good. Finale: already Bathsheba\u2019s husband. Now,\r\nBoldwood, yours is the ridiculous fate which always attends\r\ninterference between a man and his wife. And another word. Bad as I am,\r\nI am not such a villain as to make the marriage or misery of any woman\r\na matter of huckster and sale. Fanny has long ago left me. I don\u2019t know\r\nwhere she is. I have searched everywhere. Another word yet. You say you\r\nlove Bathsheba; yet on the merest apparent evidence you instantly\r\nbelieve in her dishonour. A fig for such love! Now that I\u2019ve taught you\r\na lesson, take your money back again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will not; I will not!\u201D said Boldwood, in a hiss.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnyhow I won\u2019t have it,\u201D said Troy, contemptuously. He wrapped the\r\npacket of gold in the notes, and threw the whole into the road.\r\n\r\nBoldwood shook his clenched fist at him. \u201CYou juggler of Satan! You\r\nblack hound! But I\u2019ll punish you yet; mark me, I\u2019ll punish you yet!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnother peal of laughter. Troy then closed the door, and locked himself\r\nin.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of that night Boldwood\u2019s dark form might have been\r\nseen walking about the hills and downs of Weatherbury like an unhappy\r\nShade in the Mournful Fields by Acheron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\nAT AN UPPER WINDOW\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was very early the next morning\u2014a time of sun and dew. The confused\r\nbeginnings of many birds\u2019 songs spread into the healthy air, and the\r\nwan blue of the heaven was here and there coated with thin webs of\r\nincorporeal cloud which were of no effect in obscuring day. All the\r\nlights in the scene were yellow as to colour, and all the shadows were\r\nattenuated as to form. The creeping plants about the old manor-house\r\nwere bowed with rows of heavy water drops, which had upon objects\r\nbehind them the effect of minute lenses of high magnifying power.\r\n\r\nJust before the clock struck five Gabriel Oak and Coggan passed the\r\nvillage cross, and went on together to the fields. They were yet barely\r\nin view of their mistress\u2019s house, when Oak fancied he saw the opening\r\nof a casement in one of the upper windows. The two men were at this\r\nmoment partially screened by an elder bush, now beginning to be\r\nenriched with black bunches of fruit, and they paused before emerging\r\nfrom its shade.\r\n\r\nA handsome man leaned idly from the lattice. He looked east and then\r\nwest, in the manner of one who makes a first morning survey. The man\r\nwas Sergeant Troy. His red jacket was loosely thrown on, but not\r\nbuttoned, and he had altogether the relaxed bearing of a soldier taking\r\nhis ease.\r\n\r\nCoggan spoke first, looking quietly at the window.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe has married him!\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nGabriel had previously beheld the sight, and he now stood with his back\r\nturned, making no reply.\r\n\r\n\u201CI fancied we should know something to-day,\u201D continued Coggan. \u201CI heard\r\nwheels pass my door just after dark\u2014you were out somewhere.\u201D He glanced\r\nround upon Gabriel. \u201CGood heavens above us, Oak, how white your face\r\nis; you look like a corpse!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo I?\u201D said Oak, with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n\u201CLean on the gate: I\u2019ll wait a bit.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAll right, all right.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey stood by the gate awhile, Gabriel listlessly staring at the\r\nground. His mind sped into the future, and saw there enacted in years\r\nof leisure the scenes of repentance that would ensue from this work of\r\nhaste. That they were married he had instantly decided. Why had it been\r\nso mysteriously managed? It had become known that she had had a fearful\r\njourney to Bath, owing to her miscalculating the distance: that the\r\nhorse had broken down, and that she had been more than two days getting\r\nthere. It was not Bathsheba\u2019s way to do things furtively. With all her\r\nfaults, she was candour itself. Could she have been entrapped? The\r\nunion was not only an unutterable grief to him: it amazed him,\r\nnotwithstanding that he had passed the preceding week in a suspicion\r\nthat such might be the issue of Troy\u2019s meeting her away from home. Her\r\nquiet return with Liddy had to some extent dispersed the dread. Just as\r\nthat imperceptible motion which appears like stillness is infinitely\r\ndivided in its properties from stillness itself, so had his hope\r\nundistinguishable from despair differed from despair indeed.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes they moved on again towards the house. The sergeant\r\nstill looked from the window.\r\n\r\n\u201CMorning, comrades!\u201D he shouted, in a cheery voice, when they came up.\r\n\r\nCoggan replied to the greeting. \u201CBain\u2019t ye going to answer the man?\u201D he\r\nthen said to Gabriel. \u201CI\u2019d say good morning\u2014you needn\u2019t spend a hapenny\r\nof meaning upon it, and yet keep the man civil.\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel soon decided too that, since the deed was done, to put the best\r\nface upon the matter would be the greatest kindness to her he loved.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood morning, Sergeant Troy,\u201D he returned, in a ghastly voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CA rambling, gloomy house this,\u201D said Troy, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy\u2014they _may_ not be married!\u201D suggested Coggan. \u201CPerhaps she\u2019s not\r\nthere.\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel shook his head. The soldier turned a little towards the east,\r\nand the sun kindled his scarlet coat to an orange glow.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut it is a nice old house,\u201D responded Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014I suppose so; but I feel like new wine in an old bottle here. My\r\nnotion is that sash-windows should be put throughout, and these old\r\nwainscoted walls brightened up a bit; or the oak cleared quite away,\r\nand the walls papered.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt would be a pity, I think.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, no. A philosopher once said in my hearing that the old builders,\r\nwho worked when art was a living thing, had no respect for the work of\r\nbuilders who went before them, but pulled down and altered as they\r\nthought fit; and why shouldn\u2019t we? \u2018Creation and preservation don\u2019t do\r\nwell together,\u2019 says he, \u2018and a million of antiquarians can\u2019t invent a\r\nstyle.\u2019 My mind exactly. I am for making this place more modern, that\r\nwe may be cheerful whilst we can.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe military man turned and surveyed the interior of the room, to\r\nassist his ideas of improvement in this direction. Gabriel and Coggan\r\nbegan to move on.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Coggan,\u201D said Troy, as if inspired by a recollection \u201Cdo you know\r\nif insanity has ever appeared in Mr. Boldwood\u2019s family?\u201D\r\n\r\nJan reflected for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201CI once heard that an uncle of his was queer in his head, but I don\u2019t\r\nknow the rights o\u2019t,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is of no importance,\u201D said Troy, lightly. \u201CWell, I shall be down in\r\nthe fields with you some time this week; but I have a few matters to\r\nattend to first. So good-day to you. We shall, of course, keep on just\r\nas friendly terms as usual. I\u2019m not a proud man: nobody is ever able to\r\nsay that of Sergeant Troy. However, what is must be, and here\u2019s\r\nhalf-a-crown to drink my health, men.\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy threw the coin dexterously across the front plot and over the\r\nfence towards Gabriel, who shunned it in its fall, his face turning to\r\nan angry red. Coggan twirled his eye, edged forward, and caught the\r\nmoney in its ricochet upon the road.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well\u2014you keep it, Coggan,\u201D said Gabriel with disdain and almost\r\nfiercely. \u201CAs for me, I\u2019ll do without gifts from him!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t show it too much,\u201D said Coggan, musingly. \u201CFor if he\u2019s married\r\nto her, mark my words, he\u2019ll buy his discharge and be our master here.\r\nTherefore \u2019tis well to say \u2018Friend\u2019 outwardly, though you say\r\n\u2018Troublehouse\u2019 within.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell\u2014perhaps it is best to be silent; but I can\u2019t go further than\r\nthat. I can\u2019t flatter, and if my place here is only to be kept by\r\nsmoothing him down, my place must be lost.\u201D\r\n\r\nA horseman, whom they had for some time seen in the distance, now\r\nappeared close beside them.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s Mr. Boldwood,\u201D said Oak. \u201CI wonder what Troy meant by his\r\nquestion.\u201D\r\n\r\nCoggan and Oak nodded respectfully to the farmer, just checked their\r\npaces to discover if they were wanted, and finding they were not stood\r\nback to let him pass on.\r\n\r\nThe only signs of the terrible sorrow Boldwood had been combating\r\nthrough the night, and was combating now, were the want of colour in\r\nhis well-defined face, the enlarged appearance of the veins in his\r\nforehead and temples, and the sharper lines about his mouth. The horse\r\nbore him away, and the very step of the animal seemed significant of\r\ndogged despair. Gabriel, for a minute, rose above his own grief in\r\nnoticing Boldwood\u2019s. He saw the square figure sitting erect upon the\r\nhorse, the head turned to neither side, the elbows steady by the hips,\r\nthe brim of the hat level and undisturbed in its onward glide, until\r\nthe keen edges of Boldwood\u2019s shape sank by degrees over the hill. To\r\none who knew the man and his story there was something more striking in\r\nthis immobility than in a collapse. The clash of discord between mood\r\nand matter here was forced painfully home to the heart; and, as in\r\nlaughter there are more dreadful phases than in tears, so was there in\r\nthe steadiness of this agonized man an expression deeper than a cry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\nWEALTH IN JEOPARDY\u2014THE REVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nOne night, at the end of August, when Bathsheba\u2019s experiences as a\r\nmarried woman were still new, and when the weather was yet dry and\r\nsultry, a man stood motionless in the stockyard of Weatherbury Upper\r\nFarm, looking at the moon and sky.\r\n\r\nThe night had a sinister aspect. A heated breeze from the south slowly\r\nfanned the summits of lofty objects, and in the sky dashes of buoyant\r\ncloud were sailing in a course at right angles to that of another\r\nstratum, neither of them in the direction of the breeze below. The\r\nmoon, as seen through these films, had a lurid metallic look. The\r\nfields were sallow with the impure light, and all were tinged in\r\nmonochrome, as if beheld through stained glass. The same evening the\r\nsheep had trailed homeward head to tail, the behaviour of the rooks had\r\nbeen confused, and the horses had moved with timidity and caution.\r\n\r\nThunder was imminent, and, taking some secondary appearances into\r\nconsideration, it was likely to be followed by one of the lengthened\r\nrains which mark the close of dry weather for the season. Before twelve\r\nhours had passed a harvest atmosphere would be a bygone thing.\r\n\r\nOak gazed with misgiving at eight naked and unprotected ricks, massive\r\nand heavy with the rich produce of one-half the farm for that year. He\r\nwent on to the barn.\r\n\r\nThis was the night which had been selected by Sergeant Troy\u2014ruling now\r\nin the room of his wife\u2014for giving the harvest supper and dance. As Oak\r\napproached the building the sound of violins and a tambourine, and the\r\nregular jigging of many feet, grew more distinct. He came close to the\r\nlarge doors, one of which stood slightly ajar, and looked in.\r\n\r\nThe central space, together with the recess at one end, was emptied of\r\nall incumbrances, and this area, covering about two-thirds of the\r\nwhole, was appropriated for the gathering, the remaining end, which was\r\npiled to the ceiling with oats, being screened off with sail-cloth.\r\nTufts and garlands of green foliage decorated the walls, beams, and\r\nextemporized chandeliers, and immediately opposite to Oak a rostrum had\r\nbeen erected, bearing a table and chairs. Here sat three fiddlers, and\r\nbeside them stood a frantic man with his hair on end, perspiration\r\nstreaming down his cheeks, and a tambourine quivering in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe dance ended, and on the black oak floor in the midst a new row of\r\ncouples formed for another.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, ma\u2019am, and no offence I hope, I ask what dance you would like\r\nnext?\u201D said the first violin.\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, it makes no difference,\u201D said the clear voice of Bathsheba,\r\nwho stood at the inner end of the building, observing the scene from\r\nbehind a table covered with cups and viands. Troy was lolling beside\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen,\u201D said the fiddler, \u201CI\u2019ll venture to name that the right and\r\nproper thing is \u2018The Soldier\u2019s Joy\u2019\u2014there being a gallant soldier\r\nmarried into the farm\u2014hey, my sonnies, and gentlemen all?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt shall be \u2018The Soldier\u2019s Joy,\u2019\u201D exclaimed a chorus.\r\n\r\n\u201CThanks for the compliment,\u201D said the sergeant gaily, taking Bathsheba\r\nby the hand and leading her to the top of the dance. \u201CFor though I have\r\npurchased my discharge from Her Most Gracious Majesty\u2019s regiment of\r\ncavalry the 11th Dragoon Guards, to attend to the new duties awaiting\r\nme here, I shall continue a soldier in spirit and feeling as long as I\r\nlive.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the dance began. As to the merits of \u201CThe Soldier\u2019s Joy,\u201D there\r\ncannot be, and never were, two opinions. It has been observed in the\r\nmusical circles of Weatherbury and its vicinity that this melody, at\r\nthe end of three-quarters of an hour of thunderous footing, still\r\npossesses more stimulative properties for the heel and toe than the\r\nmajority of other dances at their first opening. \u201CThe Soldier\u2019s Joy\u201D\r\nhas, too, an additional charm, in being so admirably adapted to the\r\ntambourine aforesaid\u2014no mean instrument in the hands of a performer who\r\nunderstands the proper convulsions, spasms, St. Vitus\u2019s dances, and\r\nfearful frenzies necessary when exhibiting its tones in their highest\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThe immortal tune ended, a fine DD rolling forth from the bass-viol\r\nwith the sonorousness of a cannonade, and Gabriel delayed his entry no\r\nlonger. He avoided Bathsheba, and got as near as possible to the\r\nplatform, where Sergeant Troy was now seated, drinking\r\nbrandy-and-water, though the others drank without exception cider and\r\nale. Gabriel could not easily thrust himself within speaking distance\r\nof the sergeant, and he sent a message, asking him to come down for a\r\nmoment. The sergeant said he could not attend.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you tell him, then,\u201D said Gabriel, \u201Cthat I only stepped ath\u2019art\r\nto say that a heavy rain is sure to fall soon, and that something\r\nshould be done to protect the ricks?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMr. Troy says it will not rain,\u201D returned the messenger, \u201Cand he\r\ncannot stop to talk to you about such fidgets.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn juxtaposition with Troy, Oak had a melancholy tendency to look like\r\na candle beside gas, and ill at ease, he went out again, thinking he\r\nwould go home; for, under the circumstances, he had no heart for the\r\nscene in the barn. At the door he paused for a moment: Troy was\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n\u201CFriends, it is not only the harvest home that we are celebrating\r\nto-night; but this is also a Wedding Feast. A short time ago I had the\r\nhappiness to lead to the altar this lady, your mistress, and not until\r\nnow have we been able to give any public flourish to the event in\r\nWeatherbury. That it may be thoroughly well done, and that every man\r\nmay go happy to bed, I have ordered to be brought here some bottles of\r\nbrandy and kettles of hot water. A treble-strong goblet will be handed\r\nround to each guest.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba put her hand upon his arm, and, with upturned pale face, said\r\nimploringly, \u201CNo\u2014don\u2019t give it to them\u2014pray don\u2019t, Frank! It will only\r\ndo them harm: they have had enough of everything.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue\u2014we don\u2019t wish for no more, thank ye,\u201D said one or two.\r\n\r\n\u201CPooh!\u201D said the sergeant contemptuously, and raised his voice as if\r\nlighted up by a new idea. \u201CFriends,\u201D he said, \u201Cwe\u2019ll send the\r\nwomen-folk home! \u2019Tis time they were in bed. Then we cockbirds will\r\nhave a jolly carouse to ourselves! If any of the men show the white\r\nfeather, let them look elsewhere for a winter\u2019s work.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba indignantly left the barn, followed by all the women and\r\nchildren. The musicians, not looking upon themselves as \u201Ccompany,\u201D\r\nslipped quietly away to their spring waggon and put in the horse. Thus\r\nTroy and the men on the farm were left sole occupants of the place.\r\nOak, not to appear unnecessarily disagreeable, stayed a little while;\r\nthen he, too, arose and quietly took his departure, followed by a\r\nfriendly oath from the sergeant for not staying to a second round of\r\ngrog.\r\n\r\nGabriel proceeded towards his home. In approaching the door, his toe\r\nkicked something which felt and sounded soft, leathery, and distended,\r\nlike a boxing-glove. It was a large toad humbly travelling across the\r\npath. Oak took it up, thinking it might be better to kill the creature\r\nto save it from pain; but finding it uninjured, he placed it again\r\namong the grass. He knew what this direct message from the Great Mother\r\nmeant. And soon came another.\r\n\r\nWhen he struck a light indoors there appeared upon the table a thin\r\nglistening streak, as if a brush of varnish had been lightly dragged\r\nacross it. Oak\u2019s eyes followed the serpentine sheen to the other side,\r\nwhere it led up to a huge brown garden-slug, which had come indoors\r\nto-night for reasons of its own. It was Nature\u2019s second way of hinting\r\nto him that he was to prepare for foul weather.\r\n\r\nOak sat down meditating for nearly an hour. During this time two black\r\nspiders, of the kind common in thatched houses, promenaded the ceiling,\r\nultimately dropping to the floor. This reminded him that if there was\r\none class of manifestation on this matter that he thoroughly\r\nunderstood, it was the instincts of sheep. He left the room, ran across\r\ntwo or three fields towards the flock, got upon a hedge, and looked\r\nover among them.\r\n\r\nThey were crowded close together on the other side around some furze\r\nbushes, and the first peculiarity observable was that, on the sudden\r\nappearance of Oak\u2019s head over the fence, they did not stir or run away.\r\nThey had now a terror of something greater than their terror of man.\r\nBut this was not the most noteworthy feature: they were all grouped in\r\nsuch a way that their tails, without a single exception, were towards\r\nthat half of the horizon from which the storm threatened. There was an\r\ninner circle closely huddled, and outside these they radiated wider\r\napart, the pattern formed by the flock as a whole not being unlike a\r\nvandyked lace collar, to which the clump of furze-bushes stood in the\r\nposition of a wearer\u2019s neck.\r\n\r\nThis was enough to re-establish him in his original opinion. He knew\r\nnow that he was right, and that Troy was wrong. Every voice in nature\r\nwas unanimous in bespeaking change. But two distinct translations\r\nattached to these dumb expressions. Apparently there was to be a\r\nthunder-storm, and afterwards a cold continuous rain. The creeping\r\nthings seemed to know all about the later rain, but little of the\r\ninterpolated thunder-storm; whilst the sheep knew all about the\r\nthunder-storm and nothing of the later rain.\r\n\r\nThis complication of weathers being uncommon, was all the more to be\r\nfeared. Oak returned to the stack-yard. All was silent here, and the\r\nconical tips of the ricks jutted darkly into the sky. There were five\r\nwheat-ricks in this yard, and three stacks of barley. The wheat when\r\nthreshed would average about thirty quarters to each stack; the barley,\r\nat least forty. Their value to Bathsheba, and indeed to anybody, Oak\r\nmentally estimated by the following simple calculation:\u2014\r\n\r\n 5 \u00D7 30 = 150 quarters = 500 \u00A3.\r\n3 \u00D7 40 = 120 quarters = 250 \u00A3.\r\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\r\nTotal . . 750 \u00A3.\r\n\r\nSeven hundred and fifty pounds in the divinest form that money can\r\nwear\u2014that of necessary food for man and beast: should the risk be run\r\nof deteriorating this bulk of corn to less than half its value, because\r\nof the instability of a woman? \u201CNever, if I can prevent it!\u201D said\r\nGabriel.\r\n\r\nSuch was the argument that Oak set outwardly before him. But man, even\r\nto himself, is a palimpsest, having an ostensible writing, and another\r\nbeneath the lines. It is possible that there was this golden legend\r\nunder the utilitarian one: \u201CI will help to my last effort the woman I\r\nhave loved so dearly.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe went back to the barn to endeavour to obtain assistance for covering\r\nthe ricks that very night. All was silent within, and he would have\r\npassed on in the belief that the party had broken up, had not a dim\r\nlight, yellow as saffron by contrast with the greenish whiteness\r\noutside, streamed through a knot-hole in the folding doors.\r\n\r\nGabriel looked in. An unusual picture met his eye.\r\n\r\nThe candles suspended among the evergreens had burnt down to their\r\nsockets, and in some cases the leaves tied about them were scorched.\r\nMany of the lights had quite gone out, others smoked and stank, grease\r\ndropping from them upon the floor. Here, under the table, and leaning\r\nagainst forms and chairs in every conceivable attitude except the\r\nperpendicular, were the wretched persons of all the work-folk, the hair\r\nof their heads at such low levels being suggestive of mops and brooms.\r\nIn the midst of these shone red and distinct the figure of Sergeant\r\nTroy, leaning back in a chair. Coggan was on his back, with his mouth\r\nopen, huzzing forth snores, as were several others; the united\r\nbreathings of the horizonal assemblage forming a subdued roar like\r\nLondon from a distance. Joseph Poorgrass was curled round in the\r\nfashion of a hedge-hog, apparently in attempts to present the least\r\npossible portion of his surface to the air; and behind him was dimly\r\nvisible an unimportant remnant of William Smallbury. The glasses and\r\ncups still stood upon the table, a water-jug being overturned, from\r\nwhich a small rill, after tracing its course with marvellous precision\r\ndown the centre of the long table, fell into the neck of the\r\nunconscious Mark Clark, in a steady, monotonous drip, like the dripping\r\nof a stalactite in a cave.\r\n\r\nGabriel glanced hopelessly at the group, which, with one or two\r\nexceptions, composed all the able-bodied men upon the farm. He saw at\r\nonce that if the ricks were to be saved that night, or even the next\r\nmorning, he must save them with his own hands.\r\n\r\nA faint \u201Cting-ting\u201D resounded from under Coggan\u2019s waistcoat. It was\r\nCoggan\u2019s watch striking the hour of two.\r\n\r\nOak went to the recumbent form of Matthew Moon, who usually undertook\r\nthe rough thatching of the home-stead, and shook him. The shaking was\r\nwithout effect.\r\n\r\nGabriel shouted in his ear, \u201Cwhere\u2019s your thatching-beetle and\r\nrick-stick and spars?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CUnder the staddles,\u201D said Moon, mechanically, with the unconscious\r\npromptness of a medium.\r\n\r\nGabriel let go his head, and it dropped upon the floor like a bowl. He\r\nthen went to Susan Tall\u2019s husband.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere\u2019s the key of the granary?\u201D\r\n\r\nNo answer. The question was repeated, with the same result. To be\r\nshouted to at night was evidently less of a novelty to Susan Tall\u2019s\r\nhusband than to Matthew Moon. Oak flung down Tall\u2019s head into the\r\ncorner again and turned away.\r\n\r\nTo be just, the men were not greatly to blame for this painful and\r\ndemoralizing termination to the evening\u2019s entertainment. Sergeant Troy\r\nhad so strenuously insisted, glass in hand, that drinking should be the\r\nbond of their union, that those who wished to refuse hardly liked to be\r\nso unmannerly under the circumstances. Having from their youth up been\r\nentirely unaccustomed to any liquor stronger than cider or mild ale, it\r\nwas no wonder that they had succumbed, one and all, with extraordinary\r\nuniformity, after the lapse of about an hour.\r\n\r\nGabriel was greatly depressed. This debauch boded ill for that wilful\r\nand fascinating mistress whom the faithful man even now felt within him\r\nas the embodiment of all that was sweet and bright and hopeless.\r\n\r\nHe put out the expiring lights, that the barn might not be endangered,\r\nclosed the door upon the men in their deep and oblivious sleep, and\r\nwent again into the lone night. A hot breeze, as if breathed from the\r\nparted lips of some dragon about to swallow the globe, fanned him from\r\nthe south, while directly opposite in the north rose a grim misshapen\r\nbody of cloud, in the very teeth of the wind. So unnaturally did it\r\nrise that one could fancy it to be lifted by machinery from below.\r\nMeanwhile the faint cloudlets had flown back into the south-east corner\r\nof the sky, as if in terror of the large cloud, like a young brood\r\ngazed in upon by some monster.\r\n\r\nGoing on to the village, Oak flung a small stone against the window of\r\nLaban Tall\u2019s bedroom, expecting Susan to open it; but nobody stirred.\r\nHe went round to the back door, which had been left unfastened for\r\nLaban\u2019s entry, and passed in to the foot of the staircase.\r\n\r\n\u201CMrs. Tall, I\u2019ve come for the key of the granary, to get at the\r\nrick-cloths,\u201D said Oak, in a stentorian voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that you?\u201D said Mrs. Susan Tall, half awake.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome along to bed, do, you drawlatching rogue\u2014keeping a body awake\r\nlike this!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt isn\u2019t Laban\u2014\u2019tis Gabriel Oak. I want the key of the granary.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGabriel! What in the name of fortune did you pretend to be Laban for?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t. I thought you meant\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes you did! What do you want here?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe key of the granary.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTake it then. \u2019Tis on the nail. People coming disturbing women at this\r\ntime of night ought\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel took the key, without waiting to hear the conclusion of the\r\ntirade. Ten minutes later his lonely figure might have been seen\r\ndragging four large water-proof coverings across the yard, and soon two\r\nof these heaps of treasure in grain were covered snug\u2014two cloths to\r\neach. Two hundred pounds were secured. Three wheat-stacks remained\r\nopen, and there were no more cloths. Oak looked under the staddles and\r\nfound a fork. He mounted the third pile of wealth and began operating,\r\nadopting the plan of sloping the upper sheaves one over the other; and,\r\nin addition, filling the interstices with the material of some untied\r\nsheaves.\r\n\r\nSo far all was well. By this hurried contrivance Bathsheba\u2019s property\r\nin wheat was safe for at any rate a week or two, provided always that\r\nthere was not much wind.\r\n\r\nNext came the barley. This it was only possible to protect by\r\nsystematic thatching. Time went on, and the moon vanished not to\r\nreappear. It was the farewell of the ambassador previous to war. The\r\nnight had a haggard look, like a sick thing; and there came finally an\r\nutter expiration of air from the whole heaven in the form of a slow\r\nbreeze, which might have been likened to a death. And now nothing was\r\nheard in the yard but the dull thuds of the beetle which drove in the\r\nspars, and the rustle of thatch in the intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\nTHE STORM\u2014THE TWO TOGETHER\r\n\r\n\r\nA light flapped over the scene, as if reflected from phosphorescent\r\nwings crossing the sky, and a rumble filled the air. It was the first\r\nmove of the approaching storm.\r\n\r\nThe second peal was noisy, with comparatively little visible lightning.\r\nGabriel saw a candle shining in Bathsheba\u2019s bedroom, and soon a shadow\r\nswept to and fro upon the blind.\r\n\r\nThen there came a third flash. Man\u0153uvres of a most extraordinary kind\r\nwere going on in the vast firmamental hollows overhead. The lightning\r\nnow was the colour of silver, and gleamed in the heavens like a mailed\r\narmy. Rumbles became rattles. Gabriel from his elevated position could\r\nsee over the landscape at least half-a-dozen miles in front. Every\r\nhedge, bush, and tree was distinct as in a line engraving. In a paddock\r\nin the same direction was a herd of heifers, and the forms of these\r\nwere visible at this moment in the act of galloping about in the\r\nwildest and maddest confusion, flinging their heels and tails high into\r\nthe air, their heads to earth. A poplar in the immediate foreground was\r\nlike an ink stroke on burnished tin. Then the picture vanished, leaving\r\nthe darkness so intense that Gabriel worked entirely by feeling with\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nHe had stuck his ricking-rod, or poniard, as it was indifferently\r\ncalled\u2014a long iron lance, polished by handling\u2014into the stack, used to\r\nsupport the sheaves instead of the support called a groom used on\r\nhouses. A blue light appeared in the zenith, and in some indescribable\r\nmanner flickered down near the top of the rod. It was the fourth of the\r\nlarger flashes. A moment later and there was a smack\u2014smart, clear, and\r\nshort. Gabriel felt his position to be anything but a safe one, and he\r\nresolved to descend.\r\n\r\nNot a drop of rain had fallen as yet. He wiped his weary brow, and\r\nlooked again at the black forms of the unprotected stacks. Was his life\r\nso valuable to him after all? What were his prospects that he should be\r\nso chary of running risk, when important and urgent labour could not be\r\ncarried on without such risk? He resolved to stick to the stack.\r\nHowever, he took a precaution. Under the staddles was a long tethering\r\nchain, used to prevent the escape of errant horses. This he carried up\r\nthe ladder, and sticking his rod through the clog at one end, allowed\r\nthe other end of the chain to trail upon the ground. The spike attached\r\nto it he drove in. Under the shadow of this extemporized\r\nlightning-conductor he felt himself comparatively safe.\r\n\r\nBefore Oak had laid his hands upon his tools again out leapt the fifth\r\nflash, with the spring of a serpent and the shout of a fiend. It was\r\ngreen as an emerald, and the reverberation was stunning. What was this\r\nthe light revealed to him? In the open ground before him, as he looked\r\nover the ridge of the rick, was a dark and apparently female form.\r\nCould it be that of the only venturesome woman in the parish\u2014Bathsheba?\r\nThe form moved on a step: then he could see no more.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that you, ma\u2019am?\u201D said Gabriel to the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho is there?\u201D said the voice of Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\u201CGabriel. I am on the rick, thatching.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Gabriel!\u2014and are you? I have come about them. The weather awoke\r\nme, and I thought of the corn. I am so distressed about it\u2014can we save\r\nit anyhow? I cannot find my husband. Is he with you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is not here.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know where he is?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAsleep in the barn.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe promised that the stacks should be seen to, and now they are all\r\nneglected! Can I do anything to help? Liddy is afraid to come out.\r\nFancy finding you here at such an hour! Surely I can do something?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou can bring up some reed-sheaves to me, one by one, ma\u2019am; if you\r\nare not afraid to come up the ladder in the dark,\u201D said Gabriel. \u201CEvery\r\nmoment is precious now, and that would save a good deal of time. It is\r\nnot very dark when the lightning has been gone a bit.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll do anything!\u201D she said, resolutely. She instantly took a sheaf\r\nupon her shoulder, clambered up close to his heels, placed it behind\r\nthe rod, and descended for another. At her third ascent the rick\r\nsuddenly brightened with the brazen glare of shining majolica\u2014every\r\nknot in every straw was visible. On the slope in front of him appeared\r\ntwo human shapes, black as jet. The rick lost its sheen\u2014the shapes\r\nvanished. Gabriel turned his head. It had been the sixth flash which\r\nhad come from the east behind him, and the two dark forms on the slope\r\nhad been the shadows of himself and Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nThen came the peal. It hardly was credible that such a heavenly light\r\ncould be the parent of such a diabolical sound.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow terrible!\u201D she exclaimed, and clutched him by the sleeve. Gabriel\r\nturned, and steadied her on her aerial perch by holding her arm. At the\r\nsame moment, while he was still reversed in his attitude, there was\r\nmore light, and he saw, as it were, a copy of the tall poplar tree on\r\nthe hill drawn in black on the wall of the barn. It was the shadow of\r\nthat tree, thrown across by a secondary flash in the west.\r\n\r\nThe next flare came. Bathsheba was on the ground now, shouldering\r\nanother sheaf, and she bore its dazzle without flinching\u2014thunder and\r\nall\u2014and again ascended with the load. There was then a silence\r\neverywhere for four or five minutes, and the crunch of the spars, as\r\nGabriel hastily drove them in, could again be distinctly heard. He\r\nthought the crisis of the storm had passed. But there came a burst of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\u201CHold on!\u201D said Gabriel, taking the sheaf from her shoulder, and\r\ngrasping her arm again.\r\n\r\nHeaven opened then, indeed. The flash was almost too novel for its\r\ninexpressibly dangerous nature to be at once realized, and they could\r\nonly comprehend the magnificence of its beauty. It sprang from east,\r\nwest, north, south, and was a perfect dance of death. The forms of\r\nskeletons appeared in the air, shaped with blue fire for bones\u2014dancing,\r\nleaping, striding, racing around, and mingling altogether in\r\nunparalleled confusion. With these were intertwined undulating snakes\r\nof green, and behind these was a broad mass of lesser light.\r\nSimultaneously came from every part of the tumbling sky what may be\r\ncalled a shout; since, though no shout ever came near it, it was more\r\nof the nature of a shout than of anything else earthly. In the meantime\r\none of the grisly forms had alighted upon the point of Gabriel\u2019s rod,\r\nto run invisibly down it, down the chain, and into the earth. Gabriel\r\nwas almost blinded, and he could feel Bathsheba\u2019s warm arm tremble in\r\nhis hand\u2014a sensation novel and thrilling enough; but love, life,\r\neverything human, seemed small and trifling in such close juxtaposition\r\nwith an infuriated universe.\r\n\r\nOak had hardly time to gather up these impressions into a thought, and\r\nto see how strangely the red feather of her hat shone in this light,\r\nwhen the tall tree on the hill before mentioned seemed on fire to a\r\nwhite heat, and a new one among these terrible voices mingled with the\r\nlast crash of those preceding. It was a stupefying blast, harsh and\r\npitiless, and it fell upon their ears in a dead, flat blow, without\r\nthat reverberation which lends the tones of a drum to more distant\r\nthunder. By the lustre reflected from every part of the earth and from\r\nthe wide domical scoop above it, he saw that the tree was sliced down\r\nthe whole length of its tall, straight stem, a huge riband of bark\r\nbeing apparently flung off. The other portion remained erect, and\r\nrevealed the bared surface as a strip of white down the front. The\r\nlightning had struck the tree. A sulphurous smell filled the air; then\r\nall was silent, and black as a cave in Hinnom.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe had a narrow escape!\u201D said Gabriel, hurriedly. \u201CYou had better go\r\ndown.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba said nothing; but he could distinctly hear her rhythmical\r\npants, and the recurrent rustle of the sheaf beside her in response to\r\nher frightened pulsations. She descended the ladder, and, on second\r\nthoughts, he followed her. The darkness was now impenetrable by the\r\nsharpest vision. They both stood still at the bottom, side by side.\r\nBathsheba appeared to think only of the weather\u2014Oak thought only of her\r\njust then. At last he said\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CThe storm seems to have passed now, at any rate.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI think so too,\u201D said Bathsheba. \u201CThough there are multitudes of\r\ngleams, look!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe sky was now filled with an incessant light, frequent repetition\r\nmelting into complete continuity, as an unbroken sound results from the\r\nsuccessive strokes on a gong.\r\n\r\n\u201CNothing serious,\u201D said he. \u201CI cannot understand no rain falling. But\r\nHeaven be praised, it is all the better for us. I am now going up\r\nagain.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGabriel, you are kinder than I deserve! I will stay and help you yet.\r\nOh, why are not some of the others here!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey would have been here if they could,\u201D said Oak, in a hesitating\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\u201CO, I know it all\u2014all,\u201D she said, adding slowly: \u201CThey are all asleep\r\nin the barn, in a drunken sleep, and my husband among them. That\u2019s it,\r\nis it not? Don\u2019t think I am a timid woman and can\u2019t endure things.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am not certain,\u201D said Gabriel. \u201CI will go and see.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe crossed to the barn, leaving her there alone. He looked through the\r\nchinks of the door. All was in total darkness, as he had left it, and\r\nthere still arose, as at the former time, the steady buzz of many\r\nsnores.\r\n\r\nHe felt a zephyr curling about his cheek, and turned. It was\r\nBathsheba\u2019s breath\u2014she had followed him, and was looking into the same\r\nchink.\r\n\r\nHe endeavoured to put off the immediate and painful subject of their\r\nthoughts by remarking gently, \u201CIf you\u2019ll come back again, miss\u2014ma\u2019am,\r\nand hand up a few more; it would save much time.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Oak went back again, ascended to the top, stepped off the ladder\r\nfor greater expedition, and went on thatching. She followed, but\r\nwithout a sheaf.\r\n\r\n\u201CGabriel,\u201D she said, in a strange and impressive voice.\r\n\r\nOak looked up at her. She had not spoken since he left the barn. The\r\nsoft and continual shimmer of the dying lightning showed a marble face\r\nhigh against the black sky of the opposite quarter. Bathsheba was\r\nsitting almost on the apex of the stack, her feet gathered up beneath\r\nher, and resting on the top round of the ladder.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, mistress,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CI suppose you thought that when I galloped away to Bath that night it\r\nwas on purpose to be married?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI did at last\u2014not at first,\u201D he answered, somewhat surprised at the\r\nabruptness with which this new subject was broached.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd others thought so, too?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you blamed me for it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell\u2014a little.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI thought so. Now, I care a little for your good opinion, and I want\r\nto explain something\u2014I have longed to do it ever since I returned, and\r\nyou looked so gravely at me. For if I were to die\u2014and I may die soon\u2014it\r\nwould be dreadful that you should always think mistakenly of me. Now,\r\nlisten.\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel ceased his rustling.\r\n\r\n\u201CI went to Bath that night in the full intention of breaking off my\r\nengagement to Mr. Troy. It was owing to circumstances which occurred\r\nafter I got there that\u2014that we were married. Now, do you see the matter\r\nin a new light?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do\u2014somewhat.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI must, I suppose, say more, now that I have begun. And perhaps it\u2019s\r\nno harm, for you are certainly under no delusion that I ever loved you,\r\nor that I can have any object in speaking, more than that object I have\r\nmentioned. Well, I was alone in a strange city, and the horse was lame.\r\nAnd at last I didn\u2019t know what to do. I saw, when it was too late, that\r\nscandal might seize hold of me for meeting him alone in that way. But I\r\nwas coming away, when he suddenly said he had that day seen a woman\r\nmore beautiful than I, and that his constancy could not be counted on\r\nunless I at once became his.... And I was grieved and troubled\u2014\u201D She\r\ncleared her voice, and waited a moment, as if to gather breath. \u201CAnd\r\nthen, between jealousy and distraction, I married him!\u201D she whispered\r\nwith desperate impetuosity.\r\n\r\nGabriel made no reply.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe was not to blame, for it was perfectly true about\u2014about his seeing\r\nsomebody else,\u201D she quickly added. \u201CAnd now I don\u2019t wish for a single\r\nremark from you upon the subject\u2014indeed, I forbid it. I only wanted you\r\nto know that misunderstood bit of my history before a time comes when\r\nyou could never know it.\u2014You want some more sheaves?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe went down the ladder, and the work proceeded. Gabriel soon\r\nperceived a languor in the movements of his mistress up and down, and\r\nhe said to her, gently as a mother\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CI think you had better go indoors now, you are tired. I can finish the\r\nrest alone. If the wind does not change the rain is likely to keep\r\noff.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I am useless I will go,\u201D said Bathsheba, in a flagging cadence.\r\n\u201CBut O, if your life should be lost!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are not useless; but I would rather not tire you longer. You have\r\ndone well.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you better!\u201D she said, gratefully. \u201CThank you for your devotion, a\r\nthousand times, Gabriel! Goodnight\u2014I know you are doing your very best\r\nfor me.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe diminished in the gloom, and vanished, and he heard the latch of\r\nthe gate fall as she passed through. He worked in a reverie now, musing\r\nupon her story, and upon the contradictoriness of that feminine heart\r\nwhich had caused her to speak more warmly to him to-night than she ever\r\nhad done whilst unmarried and free to speak as warmly as she chose.\r\n\r\nHe was disturbed in his meditation by a grating noise from the\r\ncoach-house. It was the vane on the roof turning round, and this change\r\nin the wind was the signal for a disastrous rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\nRAIN\u2014ONE SOLITARY MEETS ANOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now five o\u2019clock, and the dawn was promising to break in hues of\r\ndrab and ash.\r\n\r\nThe air changed its temperature and stirred itself more vigorously.\r\nCool breezes coursed in transparent eddies round Oak\u2019s face. The wind\r\nshifted yet a point or two and blew stronger. In ten minutes every wind\r\nof heaven seemed to be roaming at large. Some of the thatching on the\r\nwheat-stacks was now whirled fantastically aloft, and had to be\r\nreplaced and weighted with some rails that lay near at hand. This done,\r\nOak slaved away again at the barley. A huge drop of rain smote his\r\nface, the wind snarled round every corner, the trees rocked to the\r\nbases of their trunks, and the twigs clashed in strife. Driving in\r\nspars at any point and on any system, inch by inch he covered more and\r\nmore safely from ruin this distracting impersonation of seven hundred\r\npounds. The rain came on in earnest, and Oak soon felt the water to be\r\ntracking cold and clammy routes down his back. Ultimately he was\r\nreduced well-nigh to a homogeneous sop, and the dyes of his clothes\r\ntrickled down and stood in a pool at the foot of the ladder. The rain\r\nstretched obliquely through the dull atmosphere in liquid spines,\r\nunbroken in continuity between their beginnings in the clouds and their\r\npoints in him.\r\n\r\nOak suddenly remembered that eight months before this time he had been\r\nfighting against fire in the same spot as desperately as he was\r\nfighting against water now\u2014and for a futile love of the same woman. As\r\nfor her\u2014But Oak was generous and true, and dismissed his reflections.\r\n\r\nIt was about seven o\u2019clock in the dark leaden morning when Gabriel came\r\ndown from the last stack, and thankfully exclaimed, \u201CIt is done!\u201D He\r\nwas drenched, weary, and sad, and yet not so sad as drenched and weary,\r\nfor he was cheered by a sense of success in a good cause.\r\n\r\nFaint sounds came from the barn, and he looked that way. Figures\r\nstepped singly and in pairs through the doors\u2014all walking awkwardly,\r\nand abashed, save the foremost, who wore a red jacket, and advanced\r\nwith his hands in his pockets, whistling. The others shambled after\r\nwith a conscience-stricken air: the whole procession was not unlike\r\nFlaxman\u2019s group of the suitors tottering on towards the infernal\r\nregions under the conduct of Mercury. The gnarled shapes passed into\r\nthe village, Troy, their leader, entering the farmhouse. Not a single\r\none of them had turned his face to the ricks, or apparently bestowed\r\none thought upon their condition.\r\n\r\nSoon Oak too went homeward, by a different route from theirs. In front\r\nof him against the wet glazed surface of the lane he saw a person\r\nwalking yet more slowly than himself under an umbrella. The man turned\r\nand plainly started; he was Boldwood.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow are you this morning, sir?\u201D said Oak.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, it is a wet day.\u2014Oh, I am well, very well, I thank you; quite\r\nwell.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am glad to hear it, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\nBoldwood seemed to awake to the present by degrees. \u201CYou look tired and\r\nill, Oak,\u201D he said then, desultorily regarding his companion.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am tired. You look strangely altered, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI? Not a bit of it: I am well enough. What put that into your head?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI thought you didn\u2019t look quite so topping as you used to, that was\r\nall.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed, then you are mistaken,\u201D said Boldwood, shortly. \u201CNothing hurts\r\nme. My constitution is an iron one.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve been working hard to get our ricks covered, and was barely in\r\ntime. Never had such a struggle in my life.... Yours of course are\r\nsafe, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh yes,\u201D Boldwood added, after an interval of silence: \u201CWhat did you\r\nask, Oak?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYour ricks are all covered before this time?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAt any rate, the large ones upon the stone staddles?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey are not.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThem under the hedge?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo. I forgot to tell the thatcher to set about it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNor the little one by the stile?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNor the little one by the stile. I overlooked the ricks this year.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen not a tenth of your corn will come to measure, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPossibly not.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COverlooked them,\u201D repeated Gabriel slowly to himself. It is difficult\r\nto describe the intensely dramatic effect that announcement had upon\r\nOak at such a moment. All the night he had been feeling that the\r\nneglect he was labouring to repair was abnormal and isolated\u2014the only\r\ninstance of the kind within the circuit of the county. Yet at this very\r\ntime, within the same parish, a greater waste had been going on,\r\nuncomplained of and disregarded. A few months earlier Boldwood\u2019s\r\nforgetting his husbandry would have been as preposterous an idea as a\r\nsailor forgetting he was in a ship. Oak was just thinking that whatever\r\nhe himself might have suffered from Bathsheba\u2019s marriage, here was a\r\nman who had suffered more, when Boldwood spoke in a changed voice\u2014that\r\nof one who yearned to make a confidence and relieve his heart by an\r\noutpouring.\r\n\r\n\u201COak, you know as well as I that things have gone wrong with me lately.\r\nI may as well own it. I was going to get a little settled in life; but\r\nin some way my plan has come to nothing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI thought my mistress would have married you,\u201D said Gabriel, not\r\nknowing enough of the full depths of Boldwood\u2019s love to keep silence on\r\nthe farmer\u2019s account, and determined not to evade discipline by doing\r\nso on his own. \u201CHowever, it is so sometimes, and nothing happens that\r\nwe expect,\u201D he added, with the repose of a man whom misfortune had\r\ninured rather than subdued.\r\n\r\n\u201CI daresay I am a joke about the parish,\u201D said Boldwood, as if the\r\nsubject came irresistibly to his tongue, and with a miserable lightness\r\nmeant to express his indifference.\r\n\r\n\u201COh no\u2014I don\u2019t think that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014But the real truth of the matter is that there was not, as some\r\nfancy, any jilting on\u2014her part. No engagement ever existed between me\r\nand Miss Everdene. People say so, but it is untrue: she never promised\r\nme!\u201D Boldwood stood still now and turned his wild face to Oak. \u201COh,\r\nGabriel,\u201D he continued, \u201CI am weak and foolish, and I don\u2019t know what,\r\nand I can\u2019t fend off my miserable grief!... I had some faint belief in\r\nthe mercy of God till I lost that woman. Yes, He prepared a gourd to\r\nshade me, and like the prophet I thanked Him and was glad. But the next\r\nday He prepared a worm to smite the gourd and wither it; and I feel it\r\nis better to die than to live!\u201D\r\n\r\nA silence followed. Boldwood aroused himself from the momentary mood of\r\nconfidence into which he had drifted, and walked on again, resuming his\r\nusual reserve.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, Gabriel,\u201D he resumed, with a carelessness which was like the smile\r\non the countenance of a skull: \u201Cit was made more of by other people\r\nthan ever it was by us. I do feel a little regret occasionally, but no\r\nwoman ever had power over me for any length of time. Well, good\r\nmorning; I can trust you not to mention to others what has passed\r\nbetween us two here.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\nCOMING HOME\u2014A CRY\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the turnpike road, between Casterbridge and Weatherbury, and about\r\nthree miles from the former place, is Yalbury Hill, one of those steep\r\nlong ascents which pervade the highways of this undulating part of\r\nSouth Wessex. In returning from market it is usual for the farmers and\r\nother gig-gentry to alight at the bottom and walk up.\r\n\r\nOne Saturday evening in the month of October Bathsheba\u2019s vehicle was\r\nduly creeping up this incline. She was sitting listlessly in the second\r\nseat of the gig, whilst walking beside her in a farmer\u2019s marketing suit\r\nof unusually fashionable cut was an erect, well-made young man. Though\r\non foot, he held the reins and whip, and occasionally aimed light cuts\r\nat the horse\u2019s ear with the end of the lash, as a recreation. This man\r\nwas her husband, formerly Sergeant Troy, who, having bought his\r\ndischarge with Bathsheba\u2019s money, was gradually transforming himself\r\ninto a farmer of a spirited and very modern school. People of\r\nunalterable ideas still insisted upon calling him \u201CSergeant\u201D when they\r\nmet him, which was in some degree owing to his having still retained\r\nthe well-shaped moustache of his military days, and the soldierly\r\nbearing inseparable from his form and training.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, if it hadn\u2019t been for that wretched rain I should have cleared\r\ntwo hundred as easy as looking, my love,\u201D he was saying. \u201CDon\u2019t you\r\nsee, it altered all the chances? To speak like a book I once read, wet\r\nweather is the narrative, and fine days are the episodes, of our\r\ncountry\u2019s history; now, isn\u2019t that true?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut the time of year is come for changeable weather.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, yes. The fact is, these autumn races are the ruin of everybody.\r\nNever did I see such a day as \u2019twas! \u2019Tis a wild open place, just out\r\nof Budmouth, and a drab sea rolled in towards us like liquid misery.\r\nWind and rain\u2014good Lord! Dark? Why, \u2019twas as black as my hat before the\r\nlast race was run. \u2019Twas five o\u2019clock, and you couldn\u2019t see the horses\r\ntill they were almost in, leave alone colours. The ground was as heavy\r\nas lead, and all judgment from a fellow\u2019s experience went for nothing.\r\nHorses, riders, people, were all blown about like ships at sea. Three\r\nbooths were blown over, and the wretched folk inside crawled out upon\r\ntheir hands and knees; and in the next field were as many as a dozen\r\nhats at one time. Ay, Pimpernel regularly stuck fast, when about sixty\r\nyards off, and when I saw Policy stepping on, it did knock my heart\r\nagainst the lining of my ribs, I assure you, my love!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you mean, Frank,\u201D said Bathsheba, sadly\u2014her voice was painfully\r\nlowered from the fulness and vivacity of the previous summer\u2014\u201Cthat you\r\nhave lost more than a hundred pounds in a month by this dreadful\r\nhorse-racing? O, Frank, it is cruel; it is foolish of you to take away\r\nmy money so. We shall have to leave the farm; that will be the end of\r\nit!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHumbug about cruel. Now, there \u2019tis again\u2014turn on the waterworks;\r\nthat\u2019s just like you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you\u2019ll promise me not to go to Budmouth second meeting, won\u2019t\r\nyou?\u201D she implored. Bathsheba was at the full depth for tears, but she\r\nmaintained a dry eye.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t see why I should; in fact, if it turns out to be a fine day, I\r\nwas thinking of taking you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever, never! I\u2019ll go a hundred miles the other way first. I hate the\r\nsound of the very word!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut the question of going to see the race or staying at home has very\r\nlittle to do with the matter. Bets are all booked safely enough before\r\nthe race begins, you may depend. Whether it is a bad race for me or a\r\ngood one, will have very little to do with our going there next\r\nMonday.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you don\u2019t mean to say that you have risked anything on this one\r\ntoo!\u201D she exclaimed, with an agonized look.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere now, don\u2019t you be a little fool. Wait till you are told. Why,\r\nBathsheba, you have lost all the pluck and sauciness you formerly had,\r\nand upon my life if I had known what a chicken-hearted creature you\r\nwere under all your boldness, I\u2019d never have\u2014I know what.\u201D\r\n\r\nA flash of indignation might have been seen in Bathsheba\u2019s dark eyes as\r\nshe looked resolutely ahead after this reply. They moved on without\r\nfurther speech, some early-withered leaves from the trees which hooded\r\nthe road at this spot occasionally spinning downward across their path\r\nto the earth.\r\n\r\nA woman appeared on the brow of the hill. The ridge was in a cutting,\r\nso that she was very near the husband and wife before she became\r\nvisible. Troy had turned towards the gig to remount, and whilst putting\r\nhis foot on the step the woman passed behind him.\r\n\r\nThough the overshadowing trees and the approach of eventide enveloped\r\nthem in gloom, Bathsheba could see plainly enough to discern the\r\nextreme poverty of the woman\u2019s garb, and the sadness of her face.\r\n\r\n\u201CPlease, sir, do you know at what time Casterbridge Union-house closes\r\nat night?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe woman said these words to Troy over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nTroy started visibly at the sound of the voice; yet he seemed to\r\nrecover presence of mind sufficient to prevent himself from giving way\r\nto his impulse to suddenly turn and face her. He said, slowly\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe woman, on hearing him speak, quickly looked up, examined the side\r\nof his face, and recognized the soldier under the yeoman\u2019s garb. Her\r\nface was drawn into an expression which had gladness and agony both\r\namong its elements. She uttered an hysterical cry, and fell down.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, poor thing!\u201D exclaimed Bathsheba, instantly preparing to alight.\r\n\r\n\u201CStay where you are, and attend to the horse!\u201D said Troy, peremptorily\r\nthrowing her the reins and the whip. \u201CWalk the horse to the top: I\u2019ll\r\nsee to the woman.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you hear? Clk\u2014Poppet!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe horse, gig, and Bathsheba moved on.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow on earth did you come here? I thought you were miles away, or\r\ndead! Why didn\u2019t you write to me?\u201D said Troy to the woman, in a\r\nstrangely gentle, yet hurried voice, as he lifted her up.\r\n\r\n\u201CI feared to.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you any money?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNone.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood Heaven\u2014I wish I had more to give you! Here\u2019s\u2014wretched\u2014the merest\r\ntrifle. It is every farthing I have left. I have none but what my wife\r\ngives me, you know, and I can\u2019t ask her now.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe woman made no answer.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have only another moment,\u201D continued Troy; \u201Cand now listen. Where\r\nare you going to-night? Casterbridge Union?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; I thought to go there.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou shan\u2019t go there; yet, wait. Yes, perhaps for to-night; I can do\r\nnothing better\u2014worse luck! Sleep there to-night, and stay there\r\nto-morrow. Monday is the first free day I have; and on Monday morning,\r\nat ten exactly, meet me on Grey\u2019s Bridge just out of the town. I\u2019ll\r\nbring all the money I can muster. You shan\u2019t want\u2014I\u2019ll see that, Fanny;\r\nthen I\u2019ll get you a lodging somewhere. Good-bye till then. I am a\r\nbrute\u2014but good-bye!\u201D\r\n\r\nAfter advancing the distance which completed the ascent of the hill,\r\nBathsheba turned her head. The woman was upon her feet, and Bathsheba\r\nsaw her withdrawing from Troy, and going feebly down the hill by the\r\nthird milestone from Casterbridge. Troy then came on towards his wife,\r\nstepped into the gig, took the reins from her hand, and without making\r\nany observation whipped the horse into a trot. He was rather agitated.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know who that woman was?\u201D said Bathsheba, looking searchingly\r\ninto his face.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do,\u201D he said, looking boldly back into hers.\r\n\r\n\u201CI thought you did,\u201D said she, with angry hauteur, and still regarding\r\nhim. \u201CWho is she?\u201D\r\n\r\nHe suddenly seemed to think that frankness would benefit neither of the\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n\u201CNothing to either of us,\u201D he said. \u201CI know her by sight.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is her name?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow should I know her name?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI think you do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThink if you will, and be\u2014\u201D The sentence was completed by a smart cut\r\nof the whip round Poppet\u2019s flank, which caused the animal to start\r\nforward at a wild pace. No more was said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\nON CASTERBRIDGE HIGHWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time the woman walked on. Her steps became feebler,\r\nand she strained her eyes to look afar upon the naked road, now\r\nindistinct amid the penumbr\u00E6 of night. At length her onward walk\r\ndwindled to the merest totter, and she opened a gate within which was a\r\nhaystack. Underneath this she sat down and presently slept.\r\n\r\nWhen the woman awoke it was to find herself in the depths of a moonless\r\nand starless night. A heavy unbroken crust of cloud stretched across\r\nthe sky, shutting out every speck of heaven; and a distant halo which\r\nhung over the town of Casterbridge was visible against the black\r\nconcave, the luminosity appearing the brighter by its great contrast\r\nwith the circumscribing darkness. Towards this weak, soft glow the\r\nwoman turned her eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I could only get there!\u201D she said. \u201CMeet him the day after\r\nto-morrow: God help me! Perhaps I shall be in my grave before then.\u201D\r\n\r\nA manor-house clock from the far depths of shadow struck the hour, one,\r\nin a small, attenuated tone. After midnight the voice of a clock seems\r\nto lose in breadth as much as in length, and to diminish its\r\nsonorousness to a thin falsetto.\r\n\r\nAfterwards a light\u2014two lights\u2014arose from the remote shade, and grew\r\nlarger. A carriage rolled along the road, and passed the gate. It\r\nprobably contained some late diners-out. The beams from one lamp shone\r\nfor a moment upon the crouching woman, and threw her face into vivid\r\nrelief. The face was young in the groundwork, old in the finish; the\r\ngeneral contours were flexuous and childlike, but the finer lineaments\r\nhad begun to be sharp and thin.\r\n\r\nThe pedestrian stood up, apparently with revived determination, and\r\nlooked around. The road appeared to be familiar to her, and she\r\ncarefully scanned the fence as she slowly walked along. Presently there\r\nbecame visible a dim white shape; it was another milestone. She drew\r\nher fingers across its face to feel the marks.\r\n\r\n\u201CTwo more!\u201D she said.\r\n\r\nShe leant against the stone as a means of rest for a short interval,\r\nthen bestirred herself, and again pursued her way. For a slight\r\ndistance she bore up bravely, afterwards flagging as before. This was\r\nbeside a lone copsewood, wherein heaps of white chips strewn upon the\r\nleafy ground showed that woodmen had been faggoting and making hurdles\r\nduring the day. Now there was not a rustle, not a breeze, not the\r\nfaintest clash of twigs to keep her company. The woman looked over the\r\ngate, opened it, and went in. Close to the entrance stood a row of\r\nfaggots, bound and unbound, together with stakes of all sizes.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds the wayfarer stood with that tense stillness which\r\nsignifies itself to be not the end, but merely the suspension, of a\r\nprevious motion. Her attitude was that of a person who listens, either\r\nto the external world of sound, or to the imagined discourse of\r\nthought. A close criticism might have detected signs proving that she\r\nwas intent on the latter alternative. Moreover, as was shown by what\r\nfollowed, she was oddly exercising the faculty of invention upon the\r\nspeciality of the clever Jacquet Droz, the designer of automatic\r\nsubstitutes for human limbs.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of the Casterbridge aurora, and by feeling with her hands,\r\nthe woman selected two sticks from the heaps. These sticks were nearly\r\nstraight to the height of three or four feet, where each branched into\r\na fork like the letter Y. She sat down, snapped off the small upper\r\ntwigs, and carried the remainder with her into the road. She placed one\r\nof these forks under each arm as a crutch, tested them, timidly threw\r\nher whole weight upon them\u2014so little that it was\u2014and swung herself\r\nforward. The girl had made for herself a material aid.\r\n\r\nThe crutches answered well. The pat of her feet, and the tap of her\r\nsticks upon the highway, were all the sounds that came from the\r\ntraveller now. She had passed the last milestone by a good long\r\ndistance, and began to look wistfully towards the bank as if\r\ncalculating upon another milestone soon. The crutches, though so very\r\nuseful, had their limits of power. Mechanism only transfers labour,\r\nbeing powerless to supersede it, and the original amount of exertion\r\nwas not cleared away; it was thrown into the body and arms. She was\r\nexhausted, and each swing forward became fainter. At last she swayed\r\nsideways, and fell.\r\n\r\nHere she lay, a shapeless heap, for ten minutes and more. The morning\r\nwind began to boom dully over the flats, and to move afresh dead leaves\r\nwhich had lain still since yesterday. The woman desperately turned\r\nround upon her knees, and next rose to her feet. Steadying herself by\r\nthe help of one crutch, she essayed a step, then another, then a third,\r\nusing the crutches now as walking-sticks only. Thus she progressed till\r\ndescending Mellstock Hill another milestone appeared, and soon the\r\nbeginning of an iron-railed fence came into view. She staggered across\r\nto the first post, clung to it, and looked around.\r\n\r\nThe Casterbridge lights were now individually visible. It was getting\r\ntowards morning, and vehicles might be hoped for, if not expected soon.\r\nShe listened. There was not a sound of life save that acme and\r\nsublimation of all dismal sounds, the bark of a fox, its three hollow\r\nnotes being rendered at intervals of a minute with the precision of a\r\nfuneral bell.\r\n\r\n\u201CLess than a mile!\u201D the woman murmured. \u201CNo; more,\u201D she added, after a\r\npause. \u201CThe mile is to the county hall, and my resting-place is on the\r\nother side Casterbridge. A little over a mile, and there I am!\u201D After\r\nan interval she again spoke. \u201CFive or six steps to a yard\u2014six perhaps.\r\nI have to go seventeen hundred yards. A hundred times six, six hundred.\r\nSeventeen times that. O pity me, Lord!\u201D\r\n\r\nHolding to the rails, she advanced, thrusting one hand forward upon the\r\nrail, then the other, then leaning over it whilst she dragged her feet\r\non beneath.\r\n\r\nThis woman was not given to soliloquy; but extremity of feeling lessens\r\nthe individuality of the weak, as it increases that of the strong. She\r\nsaid again in the same tone, \u201CI\u2019ll believe that the end lies five posts\r\nforward, and no further, and so get strength to pass them.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis was a practical application of the principle that a half-feigned\r\nand fictitious faith is better than no faith at all.\r\n\r\nShe passed five posts and held on to the fifth.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll pass five more by believing my longed-for spot is at the next\r\nfifth. I can do it.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe passed five more.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt lies only five further.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe passed five more.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut it is five further.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe passed them.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat stone bridge is the end of my journey,\u201D she said, when the bridge\r\nover the Froom was in view.\r\n\r\nShe crawled to the bridge. During the effort each breath of the woman\r\nwent into the air as if never to return again.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow for the truth of the matter,\u201D she said, sitting down. \u201CThe truth\r\nis, that I have less than half a mile.\u201D Self-beguilement with what she\r\nhad known all the time to be false had given her strength to come over\r\nhalf a mile that she would have been powerless to face in the lump. The\r\nartifice showed that the woman, by some mysterious intuition, had\r\ngrasped the paradoxical truth that blindness may operate more\r\nvigorously than prescience, and the short-sighted effect more than the\r\nfar-seeing; that limitation, and not comprehensiveness, is needed for\r\nstriking a blow.\r\n\r\nThe half-mile stood now before the sick and weary woman like a stolid\r\nJuggernaut. It was an impassive King of her world. The road here ran\r\nacross Durnover Moor, open to the road on either side. She surveyed the\r\nwide space, the lights, herself, sighed, and lay down against a\r\nguard-stone of the bridge.\r\n\r\nNever was ingenuity exercised so sorely as the traveller here exercised\r\nhers. Every conceivable aid, method, stratagem, mechanism, by which\r\nthese last desperate eight hundred yards could be overpassed by a human\r\nbeing unperceived, was revolved in her busy brain, and dismissed as\r\nimpracticable. She thought of sticks, wheels, crawling\u2014she even thought\r\nof rolling. But the exertion demanded by either of these latter two was\r\ngreater than to walk erect. The faculty of contrivance was worn out.\r\nHopelessness had come at last.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo further!\u201D she whispered, and closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nFrom the stripe of shadow on the opposite side of the bridge a portion\r\nof shade seemed to detach itself and move into isolation upon the pale\r\nwhite of the road. It glided noiselessly towards the recumbent woman.\r\n\r\nShe became conscious of something touching her hand; it was softness\r\nand it was warmth. She opened her eyes, and the substance touched her\r\nface. A dog was licking her cheek.\r\n\r\nHe was a huge, heavy, and quiet creature, standing darkly against the\r\nlow horizon, and at least two feet higher than the present position of\r\nher eyes. Whether Newfoundland, mastiff, bloodhound, or what not, it\r\nwas impossible to say. He seemed to be of too strange and mysterious a\r\nnature to belong to any variety among those of popular nomenclature.\r\nBeing thus assignable to no breed, he was the ideal embodiment of\r\ncanine greatness\u2014a generalization from what was common to all. Night,\r\nin its sad, solemn, and benevolent aspect, apart from its stealthy and\r\ncruel side, was personified in this form. Darkness endows the small and\r\nordinary ones among mankind with poetical power, and even the suffering\r\nwoman threw her idea into figure.\r\n\r\nIn her reclining position she looked up to him just as in earlier times\r\nshe had, when standing, looked up to a man. The animal, who was as\r\nhomeless as she, respectfully withdrew a step or two when the woman\r\nmoved, and, seeing that she did not repulse him, he licked her hand\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nA thought moved within her like lightning. \u201CPerhaps I can make use of\r\nhim\u2014I might do it then!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe pointed in the direction of Casterbridge, and the dog seemed to\r\nmisunderstand: he trotted on. Then, finding she could not follow, he\r\ncame back and whined.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate and saddest singularity of woman\u2019s effort and invention\r\nwas reached when, with a quickened breathing, she rose to a stooping\r\nposture, and, resting her two little arms upon the shoulders of the\r\ndog, leant firmly thereon, and murmured stimulating words. Whilst she\r\nsorrowed in her heart she cheered with her voice, and what was stranger\r\nthan that the strong should need encouragement from the weak was that\r\ncheerfulness should be so well stimulated by such utter dejection. Her\r\nfriend moved forward slowly, and she with small mincing steps moved\r\nforward beside him, half her weight being thrown upon the animal.\r\nSometimes she sank as she had sunk from walking erect, from the\r\ncrutches, from the rails. The dog, who now thoroughly understood her\r\ndesire and her incapacity, was frantic in his distress on these\r\noccasions; he would tug at her dress and run forward. She always called\r\nhim back, and it was now to be observed that the woman listened for\r\nhuman sounds only to avoid them. It was evident that she had an object\r\nin keeping her presence on the road and her forlorn state unknown.\r\n\r\nTheir progress was necessarily very slow. They reached the bottom of\r\nthe town, and the Casterbridge lamps lay before them like fallen\r\nPleiads as they turned to the left into the dense shade of a deserted\r\navenue of chestnuts, and so skirted the borough. Thus the town was\r\npassed, and the goal was reached.\r\n\r\nOn this much-desired spot outside the town rose a picturesque building.\r\nOriginally it had been a mere case to hold people. The shell had been\r\nso thin, so devoid of excrescence, and so closely drawn over the\r\naccommodation granted, that the grim character of what was beneath\r\nshowed through it, as the shape of a body is visible under a\r\nwinding-sheet.\r\n\r\nThen Nature, as if offended, lent a hand. Masses of ivy grew up,\r\ncompletely covering the walls, till the place looked like an abbey; and\r\nit was discovered that the view from the front, over the Casterbridge\r\nchimneys, was one of the most magnificent in the county. A neighbouring\r\nearl once said that he would give up a year\u2019s rental to have at his own\r\ndoor the view enjoyed by the inmates from theirs\u2014and very probably the\r\ninmates would have given up the view for his year\u2019s rental.\r\n\r\nThis stone edifice consisted of a central mass and two wings, whereon\r\nstood as sentinels a few slim chimneys, now gurgling sorrowfully to the\r\nslow wind. In the wall was a gate, and by the gate a bellpull formed of\r\na hanging wire. The woman raised herself as high as possible upon her\r\nknees, and could just reach the handle. She moved it and fell forwards\r\nin a bowed attitude, her face upon her bosom.\r\n\r\nIt was getting on towards six o\u2019clock, and sounds of movement were to\r\nbe heard inside the building which was the haven of rest to this\r\nwearied soul. A little door by the large one was opened, and a man\r\nappeared inside. He discerned the panting heap of clothes, went back\r\nfor a light, and came again. He entered a second time, and returned\r\nwith two women.\r\n\r\nThese lifted the prostrate figure and assisted her in through the\r\ndoorway. The man then closed the door.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow did she get here?\u201D said one of the women.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Lord knows,\u201D said the other.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is a dog outside,\u201D murmured the overcome traveller. \u201CWhere is he\r\ngone? He helped me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI stoned him away,\u201D said the man.\r\n\r\nThe little procession then moved forward\u2014the man in front bearing the\r\nlight, the two bony women next, supporting between them the small and\r\nsupple one. Thus they entered the house and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\nSUSPICION\u2014FANNY IS SENT FOR\r\n\r\n\r\nBathsheba said very little to her husband all that evening of their\r\nreturn from market, and he was not disposed to say much to her. He\r\nexhibited the unpleasant combination of a restless condition with a\r\nsilent tongue. The next day, which was Sunday, passed nearly in the\r\nsame manner as regarded their taciturnity, Bathsheba going to church\r\nboth morning and afternoon. This was the day before the Budmouth races.\r\nIn the evening Troy said, suddenly\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CBathsheba, could you let me have twenty pounds?\u201D\r\n\r\nHer countenance instantly sank. \u201CTwenty pounds?\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe fact is, I want it badly.\u201D The anxiety upon Troy\u2019s face was\r\nunusual and very marked. It was a culmination of the mood he had been\r\nin all the day.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! for those races to-morrow.\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy for the moment made no reply. Her mistake had its advantages to a\r\nman who shrank from having his mind inspected as he did now. \u201CWell,\r\nsuppose I do want it for races?\u201D he said, at last.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Frank!\u201D Bathsheba replied, and there was such a volume of entreaty\r\nin the words. \u201COnly such a few weeks ago you said that I was far\r\nsweeter than all your other pleasures put together, and that you would\r\ngive them all up for me; and now, won\u2019t you give up this one, which is\r\nmore a worry than a pleasure? Do, Frank. Come, let me fascinate you by\r\nall I can do\u2014by pretty words and pretty looks, and everything I can\r\nthink of\u2014to stay at home. Say yes to your wife\u2014say yes!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe tenderest and softest phases of Bathsheba\u2019s nature were prominent\r\nnow\u2014advanced impulsively for his acceptance, without any of the\r\ndisguises and defences which the wariness of her character when she was\r\ncool too frequently threw over them. Few men could have resisted the\r\narch yet dignified entreaty of the beautiful face, thrown a little back\r\nand sideways in the well known attitude that expresses more than the\r\nwords it accompanies, and which seems to have been designed for these\r\nspecial occasions. Had the woman not been his wife, Troy would have\r\nsuccumbed instantly; as it was, he thought he would not deceive her\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe money is not wanted for racing debts at all,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is it for?\u201D she asked. \u201CYou worry me a great deal by these\r\nmysterious responsibilities, Frank.\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy hesitated. He did not now love her enough to allow himself to be\r\ncarried too far by her ways. Yet it was necessary to be civil. \u201CYou\r\nwrong me by such a suspicious manner,\u201D he said. \u201CSuch\r\nstrait-waistcoating as you treat me to is not becoming in you at so\r\nearly a date.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI think that I have a right to grumble a little if I pay,\u201D she said,\r\nwith features between a smile and a pout.\r\n\r\n\u201CExactly; and, the former being done, suppose we proceed to the latter.\r\nBathsheba, fun is all very well, but don\u2019t go too far, or you may have\r\ncause to regret something.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe reddened. \u201CI do that already,\u201D she said, quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you regret?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat my romance has come to an end.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAll romances end at marriage.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish you wouldn\u2019t talk like that. You grieve me to my soul by being\r\nsmart at my expense.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are dull enough at mine. I believe you hate me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot you\u2014only your faults. I do hate them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Twould be much more becoming if you set yourself to cure them. Come,\r\nlet\u2019s strike a balance with the twenty pounds, and be friends.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe gave a sigh of resignation. \u201CI have about that sum here for\r\nhousehold expenses. If you must have it, take it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery good. Thank you. I expect I shall have gone away before you are\r\nin to breakfast to-morrow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd must you go? Ah! there was a time, Frank, when it would have taken\r\na good many promises to other people to drag you away from me. You used\r\nto call me darling, then. But it doesn\u2019t matter to you how my days are\r\npassed now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI must go, in spite of sentiment.\u201D Troy, as he spoke, looked at his\r\nwatch, and, apparently actuated by _non lucendo_ principles, opened the\r\ncase at the back, revealing, snugly stowed within it, a small coil of\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\u2019s eyes had been accidentally lifted at that moment, and she\r\nsaw the action and saw the hair. She flushed in pain and surprise, and\r\nsome words escaped her before she had thought whether or not it was\r\nwise to utter them. \u201CA woman\u2019s curl of hair!\u201D she said. \u201COh, Frank,\r\nwhose is that?\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy had instantly closed his watch. He carelessly replied, as one who\r\ncloaked some feelings that the sight had stirred. \u201CWhy, yours, of\r\ncourse. Whose should it be? I had quite forgotten that I had it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a dreadful fib, Frank!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI tell you I had forgotten it!\u201D he said, loudly.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t mean that\u2014it was yellow hair.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNonsense.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s insulting me. I know it was yellow. Now whose was it? I want to\r\nknow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well\u2014I\u2019ll tell you, so make no more ado. It is the hair of a\r\nyoung woman I was going to marry before I knew you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou ought to tell me her name, then.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot do that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs she married yet?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs she alive?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs she pretty?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is wonderful how she can be, poor thing, under such an awful\r\naffliction!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAffliction\u2014what affliction?\u201D he inquired, quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201CHaving hair of that dreadful colour.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh\u2014ho\u2014I like that!\u201D said Troy, recovering himself. \u201CWhy, her hair has\r\nbeen admired by everybody who has seen her since she has worn it loose,\r\nwhich has not been long. It is beautiful hair. People used to turn\r\ntheir heads to look at it, poor girl!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPooh! that\u2019s nothing\u2014that\u2019s nothing!\u201D she exclaimed, in incipient\r\naccents of pique. \u201CIf I cared for your love as much as I used to I\r\ncould say people had turned to look at mine.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBathsheba, don\u2019t be so fitful and jealous. You knew what married life\r\nwould be like, and shouldn\u2019t have entered it if you feared these\r\ncontingencies.\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy had by this time driven her to bitterness: her heart was big in\r\nher throat, and the ducts to her eyes were painfully full. Ashamed as\r\nshe was to show emotion, at last she burst out:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is all I get for loving you so well! Ah! when I married you your\r\nlife was dearer to me than my own. I would have died for you\u2014how truly\r\nI can say that I would have died for you! And now you sneer at my\r\nfoolishness in marrying you. O! is it kind to me to throw my mistake in\r\nmy face? Whatever opinion you may have of my wisdom, you should not\r\ntell me of it so mercilessly, now that I am in your power.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t help how things fall out,\u201D said Troy; \u201Cupon my heart, women\r\nwill be the death of me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell you shouldn\u2019t keep people\u2019s hair. You\u2019ll burn it, won\u2019t you,\r\nFrank?\u201D\r\n\r\nFrank went on as if he had not heard her. \u201CThere are considerations\r\neven before my consideration for you; reparations to be made\u2014ties you\r\nknow nothing of. If you repent of marrying, so do I.\u201D\r\n\r\nTrembling now, she put her hand upon his arm, saying, in mingled tones\r\nof wretchedness and coaxing, \u201CI only repent it if you don\u2019t love me\r\nbetter than any woman in the world! I don\u2019t otherwise, Frank. You don\u2019t\r\nrepent because you already love somebody better than you love me, do\r\nyou?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. Why do you say that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou won\u2019t burn that curl. You like the woman who owns that pretty\r\nhair\u2014yes; it is pretty\u2014more beautiful than my miserable black mane!\r\nWell, it is no use; I can\u2019t help being ugly. You must like her best, if\r\nyou will!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CUntil to-day, when I took it from a drawer, I have never looked upon\r\nthat bit of hair for several months\u2014that I am ready to swear.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut just now you said \u2018ties\u2019; and then\u2014that woman we met?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Twas the meeting with her that reminded me of the hair.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs it hers, then?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. There, now that you have wormed it out of me, I hope you are\r\ncontent.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what are the ties?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh! that meant nothing\u2014a mere jest.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA mere jest!\u201D she said, in mournful astonishment. \u201CCan you jest when I\r\nam so wretchedly in earnest? Tell me the truth, Frank. I am not a fool,\r\nyou know, although I am a woman, and have my woman\u2019s moments. Come!\r\ntreat me fairly,\u201D she said, looking honestly and fearlessly into his\r\nface. \u201CI don\u2019t want much; bare justice\u2014that\u2019s all! Ah! once I felt I\r\ncould be content with nothing less than the highest homage from the\r\nhusband I should choose. Now, anything short of cruelty will content\r\nme. Yes! the independent and spirited Bathsheba is come to this!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFor Heaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t be so desperate!\u201D Troy said, snappishly,\r\nrising as he did so, and leaving the room.\r\n\r\nDirectly he had gone, Bathsheba burst into great sobs\u2014dry-eyed sobs,\r\nwhich cut as they came, without any softening by tears. But she\r\ndetermined to repress all evidences of feeling. She was conquered; but\r\nshe would never own it as long as she lived. Her pride was indeed\r\nbrought low by despairing discoveries of her spoliation by marriage\r\nwith a less pure nature than her own. She chafed to and fro in\r\nrebelliousness, like a caged leopard; her whole soul was in arms, and\r\nthe blood fired her face. Until she had met Troy, Bathsheba had been\r\nproud of her position as a woman; it had been a glory to her to know\r\nthat her lips had been touched by no man\u2019s on earth\u2014that her waist had\r\nnever been encircled by a lover\u2019s arm. She hated herself now. In those\r\nearlier days she had always nourished a secret contempt for girls who\r\nwere the slaves of the first good-looking young fellow who should\r\nchoose to salute them. She had never taken kindly to the idea of\r\nmarriage in the abstract as did the majority of women she saw about\r\nher. In the turmoil of her anxiety for her lover she had agreed to\r\nmarry him; but the perception that had accompanied her happiest hours\r\non this account was rather that of self-sacrifice than of promotion and\r\nhonour. Although she scarcely knew the divinity\u2019s name, Diana was the\r\ngoddess whom Bathsheba instinctively adored. That she had never, by\r\nlook, word, or sign, encouraged a man to approach her\u2014that she had felt\r\nherself sufficient to herself, and had in the independence of her\r\ngirlish heart fancied there was a certain degradation in renouncing the\r\nsimplicity of a maiden existence to become the humbler half of an\r\nindifferent matrimonial whole\u2014were facts now bitterly remembered. Oh,\r\nif she had never stooped to folly of this kind, respectable as it was,\r\nand could only stand again, as she had stood on the hill at Norcombe,\r\nand dare Troy or any other man to pollute a hair of her head by his\r\ninterference!\r\n\r\nThe next morning she rose earlier than usual, and had the horse saddled\r\nfor her ride round the farm in the customary way. When she came in at\r\nhalf-past eight\u2014their usual hour for breakfasting\u2014she was informed that\r\nher husband had risen, taken his breakfast, and driven off to\r\nCasterbridge with the gig and Poppet.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast she was cool and collected\u2014quite herself in fact\u2014and\r\nshe rambled to the gate, intending to walk to another quarter of the\r\nfarm, which she still personally superintended as well as her duties in\r\nthe house would permit, continually, however, finding herself preceded\r\nin forethought by Gabriel Oak, for whom she began to entertain the\r\ngenuine friendship of a sister. Of course, she sometimes thought of him\r\nin the light of an old lover, and had momentary imaginings of what life\r\nwith him as a husband would have been like; also of life with Boldwood\r\nunder the same conditions. But Bathsheba, though she could feel, was\r\nnot much given to futile dreaming, and her musings under this head were\r\nshort and entirely confined to the times when Troy\u2019s neglect was more\r\nthan ordinarily evident.\r\n\r\nShe saw coming up the road a man like Mr. Boldwood. It was Mr.\r\nBoldwood. Bathsheba blushed painfully, and watched. The farmer stopped\r\nwhen still a long way off, and held up his hand to Gabriel Oak, who was\r\nin a footpath across the field. The two men then approached each other\r\nand seemed to engage in earnest conversation.\r\n\r\nThus they continued for a long time. Joseph Poorgrass now passed near\r\nthem, wheeling a barrow of apples up the hill to Bathsheba\u2019s residence.\r\nBoldwood and Gabriel called to him, spoke to him for a few minutes, and\r\nthen all three parted, Joseph immediately coming up the hill with his\r\nbarrow.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, who had seen this pantomime with some surprise, experienced\r\ngreat relief when Boldwood turned back again. \u201CWell, what\u2019s the\r\nmessage, Joseph?\u201D she said.\r\n\r\nHe set down his barrow, and, putting upon himself the refined aspect\r\nthat a conversation with a lady required, spoke to Bathsheba over the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll never see Fanny Robin no more\u2014use nor principal\u2014ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause she\u2019s dead in the Union.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFanny dead\u2014never!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat did she die from?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know for certain; but I should be inclined to think it was\r\nfrom general neshness of constitution. She was such a limber maid that\r\n\u2019a could stand no hardship, even when I knowed her, and \u2019a went like a\r\ncandle-snoff, so \u2019tis said. She was took bad in the morning, and, being\r\nquite feeble and worn out, she died in the evening. She belongs by law\r\nto our parish; and Mr. Boldwood is going to send a waggon at three this\r\nafternoon to fetch her home here and bury her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed I shall not let Mr. Boldwood do any such thing\u2014I shall do it!\r\nFanny was my uncle\u2019s servant, and, although I only knew her for a\r\ncouple of days, she belongs to me. How very, very sad this is!\u2014the idea\r\nof Fanny being in a workhouse.\u201D Bathsheba had begun to know what\r\nsuffering was, and she spoke with real feeling.... \u201CSend across to Mr.\r\nBoldwood\u2019s, and say that Mrs. Troy will take upon herself the duty of\r\nfetching an old servant of the family.... We ought not to put her in a\r\nwaggon; we\u2019ll get a hearse.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere will hardly be time, ma\u2019am, will there?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps not,\u201D she said, musingly. \u201CWhen did you say we must be at the\r\ndoor\u2014three o\u2019clock?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThree o\u2019clock this afternoon, ma\u2019am, so to speak it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well\u2014you go with it. A pretty waggon is better than an ugly\r\nhearse, after all. Joseph, have the new spring waggon with the blue\r\nbody and red wheels, and wash it very clean. And, Joseph\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCarry with you some evergreens and flowers to put upon her\r\ncoffin\u2014indeed, gather a great many, and completely bury her in them.\r\nGet some boughs of laurustinus, and variegated box, and yew, and\r\nboy\u2019s-love; ay, and some bunches of chrysanthemum. And let old Pleasant\r\ndraw her, because she knew him so well.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will, ma\u2019am. I ought to have said that the Union, in the form of\r\nfour labouring men, will meet me when I gets to our churchyard gate,\r\nand take her and bury her according to the rites of the Board of\r\nGuardians, as by law ordained.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDear me\u2014Casterbridge Union\u2014and is Fanny come to this?\u201D said Bathsheba,\r\nmusing. \u201CI wish I had known of it sooner. I thought she was far away.\r\nHow long has she lived there?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COn\u2019y been there a day or two.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh!\u2014then she has not been staying there as a regular inmate?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo. She first went to live in a garrison-town t\u2019other side o\u2019 Wessex,\r\nand since then she\u2019s been picking up a living at seampstering in\r\nMelchester for several months, at the house of a very respectable\r\nwidow-woman who takes in work of that sort. She only got handy the\r\nUnion-house on Sunday morning \u2019a b\u2019lieve, and \u2019tis supposed here and\r\nthere that she had traipsed every step of the way from Melchester. Why\r\nshe left her place, I can\u2019t say, for I don\u2019t know; and as to a lie,\r\nwhy, I wouldn\u2019t tell it. That\u2019s the short of the story, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh-h!\u201D\r\n\r\nNo gem ever flashed from a rosy ray to a white one more rapidly than\r\nchanged the young wife\u2019s countenance whilst this word came from her in\r\na long-drawn breath. \u201CDid she walk along our turnpike-road?\u201D she said,\r\nin a suddenly restless and eager voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CI believe she did.... Ma\u2019am, shall I call Liddy? You bain\u2019t well,\r\nma\u2019am, surely? You look like a lily\u2014so pale and fainty!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; don\u2019t call her; it is nothing. When did she pass Weatherbury?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLast Saturday night.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat will do, Joseph; now you may go.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CJoseph, come hither a moment. What was the colour of Fanny Robin\u2019s\r\nhair?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, mistress, now that \u2019tis put to me so judge-and-jury like, I\r\ncan\u2019t call to mind, if ye\u2019ll believe me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever mind; go on and do what I told you. Stop\u2014well no, go on.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe turned herself away from him, that he might no longer notice the\r\nmood which had set its sign so visibly upon her, and went indoors with\r\na distressing sense of faintness and a beating brow. About an hour\r\nafter, she heard the noise of the waggon and went out, still with a\r\npainful consciousness of her bewildered and troubled look. Joseph,\r\ndressed in his best suit of clothes, was putting in the horse to start.\r\nThe shrubs and flowers were all piled in the waggon, as she had\r\ndirected; Bathsheba hardly saw them now.\r\n\r\n\u201CDied of what? did you say, Joseph?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you quite sure?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, ma\u2019am, quite sure.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSure of what?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure that all I know is that she arrived in the morning and died\r\nin the evening without further parley. What Oak and Mr. Boldwood told\r\nme was only these few words. \u2018Little Fanny Robin is dead, Joseph,\u2019\r\nGabriel said, looking in my face in his steady old way. I was very\r\nsorry, and I said, \u2018Ah!\u2014and how did she come to die?\u2019 \u2018Well, she\u2019s dead\r\nin Casterbridge Union,\u2019 he said, \u2018and perhaps \u2019tisn\u2019t much matter about\r\nhow she came to die. She reached the Union early Sunday morning, and\r\ndied in the afternoon\u2014that\u2019s clear enough.\u2019 Then I asked what she\u2019d\r\nbeen doing lately, and Mr. Boldwood turned round to me then, and left\r\noff spitting a thistle with the end of his stick. He told me about her\r\nhaving lived by seampstering in Melchester, as I mentioned to you, and\r\nthat she walked therefrom at the end of last week, passing near here\r\nSaturday night in the dusk. They then said I had better just name a\r\nhint of her death to you, and away they went. Her death might have been\r\nbrought on by biding in the night wind, you know, ma\u2019am; for people\r\nused to say she\u2019d go off in a decline: she used to cough a good deal in\r\nwinter time. However, \u2019tisn\u2019t much odds to us about that now, for \u2019tis\r\nall over.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you heard a different story at all?\u201D She looked at him so\r\nintently that Joseph\u2019s eyes quailed.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot a word, mistress, I assure \u2019ee!\u201D he said. \u201CHardly anybody in the\r\nparish knows the news yet.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wonder why Gabriel didn\u2019t bring the message to me himself. He mostly\r\nmakes a point of seeing me upon the most trifling errand.\u201D These words\r\nwere merely murmured, and she was looking upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps he was busy, ma\u2019am,\u201D Joseph suggested. \u201CAnd sometimes he seems\r\nto suffer from things upon his mind, connected with the time when he\r\nwas better off than \u2019a is now. \u2019A\u2019s rather a curious item, but a very\r\nunderstanding shepherd, and learned in books.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDid anything seem upon his mind whilst he was speaking to you about\r\nthis?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot but say that there did, ma\u2019am. He was terrible down, and so\r\nwas Farmer Boldwood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, Joseph. That will do. Go on now, or you\u2019ll be late.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba, still unhappy, went indoors again. In the course of the\r\nafternoon she said to Liddy, who had been informed of the occurrence,\r\n\u201CWhat was the colour of poor Fanny Robin\u2019s hair? Do you know? I cannot\r\nrecollect\u2014I only saw her for a day or two.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was light, ma\u2019am; but she wore it rather short, and packed away\r\nunder her cap, so that you would hardly notice it. But I have seen her\r\nlet it down when she was going to bed, and it looked beautiful then.\r\nReal golden hair.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHer young man was a soldier, was he not?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. In the same regiment as Mr. Troy. He says he knew him very well.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat, Mr. Troy says so? How came he to say that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COne day I just named it to him, and asked him if he knew Fanny\u2019s young\r\nman. He said, \u2018Oh yes, he knew the young man as well as he knew\r\nhimself, and that there wasn\u2019t a man in the regiment he liked better.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! Said that, did he?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; and he said there was a strong likeness between himself and the\r\nother young man, so that sometimes people mistook them\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLiddy, for Heaven\u2019s sake stop your talking!\u201D said Bathsheba, with the\r\nnervous petulance that comes from worrying perceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\nJOSEPH AND HIS BURDEN\u2014BUCK\u2019S HEAD\r\n\r\n\r\nA wall bounded the site of Casterbridge Union-house, except along a\r\nportion of the end. Here a high gable stood prominent, and it was\r\ncovered like the front with a mat of ivy. In this gable was no window,\r\nchimney, ornament, or protuberance of any kind. The single feature\r\nappertaining to it, beyond the expanse of dark green leaves, was a\r\nsmall door.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the door was peculiar. The sill was three or four feet\r\nabove the ground, and for a moment one was at a loss for an explanation\r\nof this exceptional altitude, till ruts immediately beneath suggested\r\nthat the door was used solely for the passage of articles and persons\r\nto and from the level of a vehicle standing on the outside. Upon the\r\nwhole, the door seemed to advertise itself as a species of Traitor\u2019s\r\nGate translated to another sphere. That entry and exit hereby was only\r\nat rare intervals became apparent on noting that tufts of grass were\r\nallowed to flourish undisturbed in the chinks of the sill.\r\n\r\nAs the clock over the South-street Alms-house pointed to five minutes\r\nto three, a blue spring waggon, picked out with red, and containing\r\nboughs and flowers, passed the end of the street, and up towards this\r\nside of the building. Whilst the chimes were yet stammering out a\r\nshattered form of \u201CMalbrook,\u201D Joseph Poorgrass rang the bell, and\r\nreceived directions to back his waggon against the high door under the\r\ngable. The door then opened, and a plain elm coffin was slowly thrust\r\nforth, and laid by two men in fustian along the middle of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nOne of the men then stepped up beside it, took from his pocket a lump\r\nof chalk, and wrote upon the cover the name and a few other words in a\r\nlarge scrawling hand. (We believe that they do these things more\r\ntenderly now, and provide a plate.) He covered the whole with a black\r\ncloth, threadbare, but decent, the tail-board of the waggon was\r\nreturned to its place, one of the men handed a certificate of registry\r\nto Poorgrass, and both entered the door, closing it behind them. Their\r\nconnection with her, short as it had been, was over for ever.\r\n\r\nJoseph then placed the flowers as enjoined, and the evergreens around\r\nthe flowers, till it was difficult to divine what the waggon contained;\r\nhe smacked his whip, and the rather pleasing funeral car crept down the\r\nhill, and along the road to Weatherbury.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon drew on apace, and, looking to the right towards the sea\r\nas he walked beside the horse, Poorgrass saw strange clouds and scrolls\r\nof mist rolling over the long ridges which girt the landscape in that\r\nquarter. They came in yet greater volumes, and indolently crept across\r\nthe intervening valleys, and around the withered papery flags of the\r\nmoor and river brinks. Then their dank spongy forms closed in upon the\r\nsky. It was a sudden overgrowth of atmospheric fungi which had their\r\nroots in the neighbouring sea, and by the time that horse, man, and\r\ncorpse entered Yalbury Great Wood, these silent workings of an\r\ninvisible hand had reached them, and they were completely enveloped,\r\nthis being the first arrival of the autumn fogs, and the first fog of\r\nthe series.\r\n\r\nThe air was as an eye suddenly struck blind. The waggon and its load\r\nrolled no longer on the horizontal division between clearness and\r\nopacity, but were imbedded in an elastic body of a monotonous pallor\r\nthroughout. There was no perceptible motion in the air, not a visible\r\ndrop of water fell upon a leaf of the beeches, birches, and firs\r\ncomposing the wood on either side. The trees stood in an attitude of\r\nintentness, as if they waited longingly for a wind to come and rock\r\nthem. A startling quiet overhung all surrounding things\u2014so completely,\r\nthat the crunching of the waggon-wheels was as a great noise, and small\r\nrustles, which had never obtained a hearing except by night, were\r\ndistinctly individualized.\r\n\r\nJoseph Poorgrass looked round upon his sad burden as it loomed faintly\r\nthrough the flowering laurustinus, then at the unfathomable gloom amid\r\nthe high trees on each hand, indistinct, shadowless, and spectre-like\r\nin their monochrome of grey. He felt anything but cheerful, and wished\r\nhe had the company even of a child or dog. Stopping the horse, he\r\nlistened. Not a footstep or wheel was audible anywhere around, and the\r\ndead silence was broken only by a heavy particle falling from a tree\r\nthrough the evergreens and alighting with a smart rap upon the coffin\r\nof poor Fanny. The fog had by this time saturated the trees, and this\r\nwas the first dropping of water from the overbrimming leaves. The\r\nhollow echo of its fall reminded the waggoner painfully of the grim\r\nLeveller. Then hard by came down another drop, then two or three.\r\nPresently there was a continual tapping of these heavy drops upon the\r\ndead leaves, the road, and the travellers. The nearer boughs were\r\nbeaded with the mist to the greyness of aged men, and the rusty-red\r\nleaves of the beeches were hung with similar drops, like diamonds on\r\nauburn hair.\r\n\r\nAt the roadside hamlet called Roy-Town, just beyond this wood, was the\r\nold inn Buck\u2019s Head. It was about a mile and a half from Weatherbury,\r\nand in the meridian times of stage-coach travelling had been the place\r\nwhere many coaches changed and kept their relays of horses. All the old\r\nstabling was now pulled down, and little remained besides the habitable\r\ninn itself, which, standing a little way back from the road, signified\r\nits existence to people far up and down the highway by a sign hanging\r\nfrom the horizontal bough of an elm on the opposite side of the way.\r\n\r\nTravellers\u2014for the variety _tourist_ had hardly developed into a\r\ndistinct species at this date\u2014sometimes said in passing, when they cast\r\ntheir eyes up to the sign-bearing tree, that artists were fond of\r\nrepresenting the signboard hanging thus, but that they themselves had\r\nnever before noticed so perfect an instance in actual working order. It\r\nwas near this tree that the waggon was standing into which Gabriel Oak\r\ncrept on his first journey to Weatherbury; but, owing to the darkness,\r\nthe sign and the inn had been unobserved.\r\n\r\nThe manners of the inn were of the old-established type. Indeed, in the\r\nminds of its frequenters they existed as unalterable formul\u00E6: _e.g._\u2014\r\n\r\nRap with the bottom of your pint for more liquor.\r\nFor tobacco, shout.\r\nIn calling for the girl in waiting, say, \u201CMaid!\u201D\r\nDitto for the landlady, \u201COld Soul!\u201D etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a relief to Joseph\u2019s heart when the friendly signboard came in\r\nview, and, stopping his horse immediately beneath it, he proceeded to\r\nfulfil an intention made a long time before. His spirits were oozing\r\nout of him quite. He turned the horse\u2019s head to the green bank, and\r\nentered the hostel for a mug of ale.\r\n\r\nGoing down into the kitchen of the inn, the floor of which was a step\r\nbelow the passage, which in its turn was a step below the road outside,\r\nwhat should Joseph see to gladden his eyes but two copper-coloured\r\ndiscs, in the form of the countenances of Mr. Jan Coggan and Mr. Mark\r\nClark. These owners of the two most appreciative throats in the\r\nneighbourhood, within the pale of respectability, were now sitting face\r\nto face over a three-legged circular table, having an iron rim to keep\r\ncups and pots from being accidentally elbowed off; they might have been\r\nsaid to resemble the setting sun and the full moon shining _vis-\u00E0-vis_\r\nacross the globe.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, \u2019tis neighbour Poorgrass!\u201D said Mark Clark. \u201CI\u2019m sure your face\r\ndon\u2019t praise your mistress\u2019s table, Joseph.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve had a very pale companion for the last four miles,\u201D said Joseph,\r\nindulging in a shudder toned down by resignation. \u201CAnd to speak the\r\ntruth, \u2019twas beginning to tell upon me. I assure ye, I ha\u2019n\u2019t seed the\r\ncolour of victuals or drink since breakfast time this morning, and that\r\nwas no more than a dew-bit afield.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen drink, Joseph, and don\u2019t restrain yourself!\u201D said Coggan, handing\r\nhim a hooped mug three-quarters full.\r\n\r\nJoseph drank for a moderately long time, then for a longer time,\r\nsaying, as he lowered the jug, \u201C\u2019Tis pretty drinking\u2014very pretty\r\ndrinking, and is more than cheerful on my melancholy errand, so to\r\nspeak it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue, drink is a pleasant delight,\u201D said Jan, as one who repeated a\r\ntruism so familiar to his brain that he hardly noticed its passage over\r\nhis tongue; and, lifting the cup, Coggan tilted his head gradually\r\nbackwards, with closed eyes, that his expectant soul might not be\r\ndiverted for one instant from its bliss by irrelevant surroundings.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I must be on again,\u201D said Poorgrass. \u201CNot but that I should like\r\nanother nip with ye; but the parish might lose confidence in me if I\r\nwas seed here.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere be ye trading o\u2019t to to-day, then, Joseph?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBack to Weatherbury. I\u2019ve got poor little Fanny Robin in my waggon\r\noutside, and I must be at the churchyard gates at a quarter to five\r\nwith her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy\u2014I\u2019ve heard of it. And so she\u2019s nailed up in parish boards after\r\nall, and nobody to pay the bell shilling and the grave half-crown.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe parish pays the grave half-crown, but not the bell shilling,\r\nbecause the bell\u2019s a luxery: but \u2019a can hardly do without the grave,\r\npoor body. However, I expect our mistress will pay all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA pretty maid as ever I see! But what\u2019s yer hurry, Joseph? The pore\r\nwoman\u2019s dead, and you can\u2019t bring her to life, and you may as well sit\r\ndown comfortable, and finish another with us.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t mind taking just the least thimbleful ye can dream of more\r\nwith ye, sonnies. But only a few minutes, because \u2019tis as \u2019tis.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf course, you\u2019ll have another drop. A man\u2019s twice the man afterwards.\r\nYou feel so warm and glorious, and you whop and slap at your work\r\nwithout any trouble, and everything goes on like sticks a-breaking. Too\r\nmuch liquor is bad, and leads us to that horned man in the smoky house;\r\nbut after all, many people haven\u2019t the gift of enjoying a wet, and\r\nsince we be highly favoured with a power that way, we should make the\r\nmost o\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue,\u201D said Mark Clark. \u201C\u2019Tis a talent the Lord has mercifully\r\nbestowed upon us, and we ought not to neglect it. But, what with the\r\nparsons and clerks and school-people and serious tea-parties, the merry\r\nold ways of good life have gone to the dogs\u2014upon my carcase, they\r\nhave!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, really, I must be onward again now,\u201D said Joseph.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, now, Joseph; nonsense! The poor woman is dead, isn\u2019t she, and\r\nwhat\u2019s your hurry?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I hope Providence won\u2019t be in a way with me for my doings,\u201D said\r\nJoseph, again sitting down. \u201CI\u2019ve been troubled with weak moments\r\nlately, \u2019tis true. I\u2019ve been drinky once this month already, and I did\r\nnot go to church a-Sunday, and I dropped a curse or two yesterday; so I\r\ndon\u2019t want to go too far for my safety. Your next world is your next\r\nworld, and not to be squandered offhand.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI believe ye to be a chapelmember, Joseph. That I do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, no, no! I don\u2019t go so far as that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFor my part,\u201D said Coggan, \u201CI\u2019m staunch Church of England.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, and faith, so be I,\u201D said Mark Clark.\r\n\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t say much for myself; I don\u2019t wish to,\u201D Coggan continued, with\r\nthat tendency to talk on principles which is characteristic of the\r\nbarley-corn. \u201CBut I\u2019ve never changed a single doctrine: I\u2019ve stuck like\r\na plaster to the old faith I was born in. Yes; there\u2019s this to be said\r\nfor the Church, a man can belong to the Church and bide in his cheerful\r\nold inn, and never trouble or worry his mind about doctrines at all.\r\nBut to be a meetinger, you must go to chapel in all winds and weathers,\r\nand make yerself as frantic as a skit. Not but that chapel members be\r\nclever chaps enough in their way. They can lift up beautiful prayers\r\nout of their own heads, all about their families and shipwrecks in the\r\nnewspaper.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey can\u2014they can,\u201D said Mark Clark, with corroborative feeling; \u201Cbut\r\nwe Churchmen, you see, must have it all printed aforehand, or, dang it\r\nall, we should no more know what to say to a great gaffer like the Lord\r\nthan babes unborn.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CChapelfolk be more hand-in-glove with them above than we,\u201D said\r\nJoseph, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Coggan. \u201CWe know very well that if anybody do go to heaven,\r\nthey will. They\u2019ve worked hard for it, and they deserve to have it,\r\nsuch as \u2019tis. I bain\u2019t such a fool as to pretend that we who stick to\r\nthe Church have the same chance as they, because we know we have not.\r\nBut I hate a feller who\u2019ll change his old ancient doctrines for the\r\nsake of getting to heaven. I\u2019d as soon turn king\u2019s-evidence for the few\r\npounds you get. Why, neighbours, when every one of my taties were\r\nfrosted, our Parson Thirdly were the man who gave me a sack for seed,\r\nthough he hardly had one for his own use, and no money to buy \u2019em. If\r\nit hadn\u2019t been for him, I shouldn\u2019t hae had a tatie to put in my\r\ngarden. D\u2019ye think I\u2019d turn after that? No, I\u2019ll stick to my side; and\r\nif we be in the wrong, so be it: I\u2019ll fall with the fallen!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell said\u2014very well said,\u201D observed Joseph.\u2014\u201CHowever, folks, I must be\r\nmoving now: upon my life I must. Pa\u2019son Thirdly will be waiting at the\r\nchurch gates, and there\u2019s the woman a-biding outside in the waggon.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CJoseph Poorgrass, don\u2019t be so miserable! Pa\u2019son Thirdly won\u2019t mind.\r\nHe\u2019s a generous man; he\u2019s found me in tracts for years, and I\u2019ve\r\nconsumed a good many in the course of a long and shady life; but he\u2019s\r\nnever been the man to cry out at the expense. Sit down.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe longer Joseph Poorgrass remained, the less his spirit was troubled\r\nby the duties which devolved upon him this afternoon. The minutes\r\nglided by uncounted, until the evening shades began perceptibly to\r\ndeepen, and the eyes of the three were but sparkling points on the\r\nsurface of darkness. Coggan\u2019s repeater struck six from his pocket in\r\nthe usual still small tones.\r\n\r\nAt that moment hasty steps were heard in the entry, and the door opened\r\nto admit the figure of Gabriel Oak, followed by the maid of the inn\r\nbearing a candle. He stared sternly at the one lengthy and two round\r\nfaces of the sitters, which confronted him with the expressions of a\r\nfiddle and a couple of warming-pans. Joseph Poorgrass blinked, and\r\nshrank several inches into the background.\r\n\r\n\u201CUpon my soul, I\u2019m ashamed of you; \u2019tis disgraceful, Joseph,\r\ndisgraceful!\u201D said Gabriel, indignantly. \u201CCoggan, you call yourself a\r\nman, and don\u2019t know better than this.\u201D\r\n\r\nCoggan looked up indefinitely at Oak, one or other of his eyes\r\noccasionally opening and closing of its own accord, as if it were not a\r\nmember, but a dozy individual with a distinct personality.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t take on so, shepherd!\u201D said Mark Clark, looking reproachfully at\r\nthe candle, which appeared to possess special features of interest for\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201CNobody can hurt a dead woman,\u201D at length said Coggan, with the\r\nprecision of a machine. \u201CAll that could be done for her is done\u2014she\u2019s\r\nbeyond us: and why should a man put himself in a tearing hurry for\r\nlifeless clay that can neither feel nor see, and don\u2019t know what you do\r\nwith her at all? If she\u2019d been alive, I would have been the first to\r\nhelp her. If she now wanted victuals and drink, I\u2019d pay for it, money\r\ndown. But she\u2019s dead, and no speed of ours will bring her to life. The\r\nwoman\u2019s past us\u2014time spent upon her is throwed away: why should we\r\nhurry to do what\u2019s not required? Drink, shepherd, and be friends, for\r\nto-morrow we may be like her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe may,\u201D added Mark Clark, emphatically, at once drinking himself, to\r\nrun no further risk of losing his chance by the event alluded to, Jan\r\nmeanwhile merging his additional thoughts of to-morrow in a song:\u2014\r\n\r\n        To-mor-row, to-mor-row!\r\nAnd while peace and plen-ty I find at my board,\r\n    With a heart free from sick-ness and sor-row,\r\nWith my friends will I share what to-day may af-ford,\r\n    And let them spread the ta-ble to-mor-row.\r\n        To-mor-row, to-mor\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CDo hold thy horning, Jan!\u201D said Oak; and turning upon Poorgrass, \u201Cas\r\nfor you, Joseph, who do your wicked deeds in such confoundedly holy\r\nways, you are as drunk as you can stand.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, Shepherd Oak, no! Listen to reason, shepherd. All that\u2019s the\r\nmatter with me is the affliction called a multiplying eye, and that\u2019s\r\nhow it is I look double to you\u2014I mean, you look double to me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA multiplying eye is a very bad thing,\u201D said Mark Clark.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt always comes on when I have been in a public-house a little time,\u201D\r\nsaid Joseph Poorgrass, meekly. \u201CYes; I see two of every sort, as if I\r\nwere some holy man living in the times of King Noah and entering into\r\nthe ark.... Y-y-y-yes,\u201D he added, becoming much affected by the picture\r\nof himself as a person thrown away, and shedding tears; \u201CI feel too\r\ngood for England: I ought to have lived in Genesis by rights, like the\r\nother men of sacrifice, and then I shouldn\u2019t have b-b-been called a\r\nd-d-drunkard in such a way!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish you\u2019d show yourself a man of spirit, and not sit whining\r\nthere!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShow myself a man of spirit?... Ah, well! let me take the name of\r\ndrunkard humbly\u2014let me be a man of contrite knees\u2014let it be! I know\r\nthat I always do say \u2018Please God\u2019 afore I do anything, from my getting\r\nup to my going down of the same, and I be willing to take as much\r\ndisgrace as there is in that holy act. Hah, yes!... But not a man of\r\nspirit? Have I ever allowed the toe of pride to be lifted against my\r\nhinder parts without groaning manfully that I question the right to do\r\nso? I inquire that query boldly?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe can\u2019t say that you have, Hero Poorgrass,\u201D admitted Jan.\r\n\r\n\u201CNever have I allowed such treatment to pass unquestioned! Yet the\r\nshepherd says in the face of that rich testimony that I be not a man of\r\nspirit! Well, let it pass by, and death is a kind friend!\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel, seeing that neither of the three was in a fit state to take\r\ncharge of the waggon for the remainder of the journey, made no reply,\r\nbut, closing the door again upon them, went across to where the vehicle\r\nstood, now getting indistinct in the fog and gloom of this mildewy\r\ntime. He pulled the horse\u2019s head from the large patch of turf it had\r\neaten bare, readjusted the boughs over the coffin, and drove along\r\nthrough the unwholesome night.\r\n\r\nIt had gradually become rumoured in the village that the body to be\r\nbrought and buried that day was all that was left of the unfortunate\r\nFanny Robin who had followed the Eleventh from Casterbridge through\r\nMelchester and onwards. But, thanks to Boldwood\u2019s reticence and Oak\u2019s\r\ngenerosity, the lover she had followed had never been individualized as\r\nTroy. Gabriel hoped that the whole truth of the matter might not be\r\npublished till at any rate the girl had been in her grave for a few\r\ndays, when the interposing barriers of earth and time, and a sense that\r\nthe events had been somewhat shut into oblivion, would deaden the sting\r\nthat revelation and invidious remark would have for Bathsheba just now.\r\n\r\nBy the time that Gabriel reached the old manor-house, her residence,\r\nwhich lay in his way to the church, it was quite dark. A man came from\r\nthe gate and said through the fog, which hung between them like blown\r\nflour\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that Poorgrass with the corpse?\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel recognized the voice as that of the parson.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe corpse is here, sir,\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have just been to inquire of Mrs. Troy if she could tell me the\r\nreason of the delay. I am afraid it is too late now for the funeral to\r\nbe performed with proper decency. Have you the registrar\u2019s\r\ncertificate?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Gabriel. \u201CI expect Poorgrass has that; and he\u2019s at the\r\nBuck\u2019s Head. I forgot to ask him for it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen that settles the matter. We\u2019ll put off the funeral till to-morrow\r\nmorning. The body may be brought on to the church, or it may be left\r\nhere at the farm and fetched by the bearers in the morning. They waited\r\nmore than an hour, and have now gone home.\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel had his reasons for thinking the latter a most objectionable\r\nplan, notwithstanding that Fanny had been an inmate of the farm-house\r\nfor several years in the lifetime of Bathsheba\u2019s uncle. Visions of\r\nseveral unhappy contingencies which might arise from this delay flitted\r\nbefore him. But his will was not law, and he went indoors to inquire of\r\nhis mistress what were her wishes on the subject. He found her in an\r\nunusual mood: her eyes as she looked up to him were suspicious and\r\nperplexed as with some antecedent thought. Troy had not yet returned.\r\nAt first Bathsheba assented with a mien of indifference to his\r\nproposition that they should go on to the church at once with their\r\nburden; but immediately afterwards, following Gabriel to the gate, she\r\nswerved to the extreme of solicitousness on Fanny\u2019s account, and\r\ndesired that the girl might be brought into the house. Oak argued upon\r\nthe convenience of leaving her in the waggon, just as she lay now, with\r\nher flowers and green leaves about her, merely wheeling the vehicle\r\ninto the coach-house till the morning, but to no purpose. \u201CIt is unkind\r\nand unchristian,\u201D she said, \u201Cto leave the poor thing in a coach-house\r\nall night.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well, then,\u201D said the parson. \u201CAnd I will arrange that the\r\nfuneral shall take place early to-morrow. Perhaps Mrs. Troy is right in\r\nfeeling that we cannot treat a dead fellow-creature too thoughtfully.\r\nWe must remember that though she may have erred grievously in leaving\r\nher home, she is still our sister: and it is to be believed that God\u2019s\r\nuncovenanted mercies are extended towards her, and that she is a member\r\nof the flock of Christ.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe parson\u2019s words spread into the heavy air with a sad yet unperturbed\r\ncadence, and Gabriel shed an honest tear. Bathsheba seemed unmoved. Mr.\r\nThirdly then left them, and Gabriel lighted a lantern. Fetching three\r\nother men to assist him, they bore the unconscious truant indoors,\r\nplacing the coffin on two benches in the middle of a little\r\nsitting-room next the hall, as Bathsheba directed.\r\n\r\nEvery one except Gabriel Oak then left the room. He still indecisively\r\nlingered beside the body. He was deeply troubled at the wretchedly\r\nironical aspect that circumstances were putting on with regard to\r\nTroy\u2019s wife, and at his own powerlessness to counteract them. In spite\r\nof his careful man\u0153uvering all this day, the very worst event that\r\ncould in any way have happened in connection with the burial had\r\nhappened now. Oak imagined a terrible discovery resulting from this\r\nafternoon\u2019s work that might cast over Bathsheba\u2019s life a shade which\r\nthe interposition of many lapsing years might but indifferently\r\nlighten, and which nothing at all might altogether remove.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as in a last attempt to save Bathsheba from, at any rate,\r\nimmediate anguish, he looked again, as he had looked before, at the\r\nchalk writing upon the coffin-lid. The scrawl was this simple one,\r\n\u201C_Fanny Robin and child_.\u201D Gabriel took his handkerchief and carefully\r\nrubbed out the two latter words, leaving visible the inscription\r\n\u201C_Fanny Robin_\u201D only. He then left the room, and went out quietly by\r\nthe front door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\nFANNY\u2019S REVENGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you want me any longer ma\u2019am?\u201D inquired Liddy, at a later hour the\r\nsame evening, standing by the door with a chamber candlestick in her\r\nhand and addressing Bathsheba, who sat cheerless and alone in the large\r\nparlour beside the first fire of the season.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo more to-night, Liddy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll sit up for master if you like, ma\u2019am. I am not at all afraid of\r\nFanny, if I may sit in my own room and have a candle. She was such a\r\nchildlike, nesh young thing that her spirit couldn\u2019t appear to anybody\r\nif it tried, I\u2019m quite sure.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh no, no! You go to bed. I\u2019ll sit up for him myself till twelve\r\no\u2019clock, and if he has not arrived by that time, I shall give him up\r\nand go to bed too.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is half-past ten now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh! is it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t you sit upstairs, ma\u2019am?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t I?\u201D said Bathsheba, desultorily. \u201CIt isn\u2019t worth\r\nwhile\u2014there\u2019s a fire here, Liddy.\u201D She suddenly exclaimed in an\r\nimpulsive and excited whisper, \u201CHave you heard anything strange said of\r\nFanny?\u201D The words had no sooner escaped her than an expression of\r\nunutterable regret crossed her face, and she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo\u2014not a word!\u201D said Liddy, looking at the weeping woman with\r\nastonishment. \u201CWhat is it makes you cry so, ma\u2019am; has anything hurt\r\nyou?\u201D She came to Bathsheba\u2019s side with a face full of sympathy.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, Liddy\u2014I don\u2019t want you any more. I can hardly say why I have taken\r\nto crying lately: I never used to cry. Good-night.\u201D\r\n\r\nLiddy then left the parlour and closed the door.\r\n\r\nBathsheba was lonely and miserable now; not lonelier actually than she\r\nhad been before her marriage; but her loneliness then was to that of\r\nthe present time as the solitude of a mountain is to the solitude of a\r\ncave. And within the last day or two had come these disquieting\r\nthoughts about her husband\u2019s past. Her wayward sentiment that evening\r\nconcerning Fanny\u2019s temporary resting-place had been the result of a\r\nstrange complication of impulses in Bathsheba\u2019s bosom. Perhaps it would\r\nbe more accurately described as a determined rebellion against her\r\nprejudices, a revulsion from a lower instinct of uncharitableness,\r\nwhich would have withheld all sympathy from the dead woman, because in\r\nlife she had preceded Bathsheba in the attentions of a man whom\r\nBathsheba had by no means ceased from loving, though her love was sick\r\nto death just now with the gravity of a further misgiving.\r\n\r\nIn five or ten minutes there was another tap at the door. Liddy\r\nreappeared, and coming in a little way stood hesitating, until at\r\nlength she said, \u201CMaryann has just heard something very strange, but I\r\nknow it isn\u2019t true. And we shall be sure to know the rights of it in a\r\nday or two.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, nothing connected with you or us, ma\u2019am. It is about Fanny. That\r\nsame thing you have heard.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have heard nothing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI mean that a wicked story is got to Weatherbury within this last\r\nhour\u2014that\u2014\u201D Liddy came close to her mistress and whispered the\r\nremainder of the sentence slowly into her ear, inclining her head as\r\nshe spoke in the direction of the room where Fanny lay.\r\n\r\nBathsheba trembled from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t believe it!\u201D she said, excitedly. \u201CAnd there\u2019s only one name\r\nwritten on the coffin-cover.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNor I, ma\u2019am. And a good many others don\u2019t; for we should surely have\r\nbeen told more about it if it had been true\u2014don\u2019t you think so, ma\u2019am?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe might or we might not.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba turned and looked into the fire, that Liddy might not see her\r\nface. Finding that her mistress was going to say no more, Liddy glided\r\nout, closed the door softly, and went to bed.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\u2019s face, as she continued looking into the fire that evening,\r\nmight have excited solicitousness on her account even among those who\r\nloved her least. The sadness of Fanny Robin\u2019s fate did not make\r\nBathsheba\u2019s glorious, although she was the Esther to this poor Vashti,\r\nand their fates might be supposed to stand in some respects as\r\ncontrasts to each other. When Liddy came into the room a second time\r\nthe beautiful eyes which met hers had worn a listless, weary look. When\r\nshe went out after telling the story they had expressed wretchedness in\r\nfull activity. Her simple country nature, fed on old-fashioned\r\nprinciples, was troubled by that which would have troubled a woman of\r\nthe world very little, both Fanny and her child, if she had one, being\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nBathsheba had grounds for conjecturing a connection between her own\r\nhistory and the dimly suspected tragedy of Fanny\u2019s end which Oak and\r\nBoldwood never for a moment credited her with possessing. The meeting\r\nwith the lonely woman on the previous Saturday night had been\r\nunwitnessed and unspoken of. Oak may have had the best of intentions in\r\nwithholding for as many days as possible the details of what had\r\nhappened to Fanny; but had he known that Bathsheba\u2019s perceptions had\r\nalready been exercised in the matter, he would have done nothing to\r\nlengthen the minutes of suspense she was now undergoing, when the\r\ncertainty which must terminate it would be the worst fact suspected\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nShe suddenly felt a longing desire to speak to some one stronger than\r\nherself, and so get strength to sustain her surmised position with\r\ndignity and her lurking doubts with stoicism. Where could she find such\r\na friend? nowhere in the house. She was by far the coolest of the women\r\nunder her roof. Patience and suspension of judgement for a few hours\r\nwere what she wanted to learn, and there was nobody to teach her. Might\r\nshe but go to Gabriel Oak!\u2014but that could not be. What a way Oak had,\r\nshe thought, of enduring things. Boldwood, who seemed so much deeper\r\nand higher and stronger in feeling than Gabriel, had not yet learnt,\r\nany more than she herself, the simple lesson which Oak showed a mastery\r\nof by every turn and look he gave\u2014that among the multitude of interests\r\nby which he was surrounded, those which affected his personal\r\nwell-being were not the most absorbing and important in his eyes. Oak\r\nmeditatively looked upon the horizon of circumstances without any\r\nspecial regard to his own standpoint in the midst. That was how she\r\nwould wish to be. But then Oak was not racked by incertitude upon the\r\ninmost matter of his bosom, as she was at this moment. Oak knew all\r\nabout Fanny that he wished to know\u2014she felt convinced of that. If she\r\nwere to go to him now at once and say no more than these few words,\r\n\u201CWhat is the truth of the story?\u201D he would feel bound in honour to tell\r\nher. It would be an inexpressible relief. No further speech would need\r\nto be uttered. He knew her so well that no eccentricity of behaviour in\r\nher would alarm him.\r\n\r\nShe flung a cloak round her, went to the door and opened it. Every\r\nblade, every twig was still. The air was yet thick with moisture,\r\nthough somewhat less dense than during the afternoon, and a steady\r\nsmack of drops upon the fallen leaves under the boughs was almost\r\nmusical in its soothing regularity. It seemed better to be out of the\r\nhouse than within it, and Bathsheba closed the door, and walked slowly\r\ndown the lane till she came opposite to Gabriel\u2019s cottage, where he now\r\nlived alone, having left Coggan\u2019s house through being pinched for room.\r\nThere was a light in one window only, and that was downstairs. The\r\nshutters were not closed, nor was any blind or curtain drawn over the\r\nwindow, neither robbery nor observation being a contingency which could\r\ndo much injury to the occupant of the domicile. Yes, it was Gabriel\r\nhimself who was sitting up: he was reading. From her standing-place in\r\nthe road she could see him plainly, sitting quite still, his light\r\ncurly head upon his hand, and only occasionally looking up to snuff the\r\ncandle which stood beside him. At length he looked at the clock, seemed\r\nsurprised at the lateness of the hour, closed his book, and arose. He\r\nwas going to bed, she knew, and if she tapped it must be done at once.\r\n\r\nAlas for her resolve! She felt she could not do it. Not for worlds now\r\ncould she give a hint about her misery to him, much less ask him\r\nplainly for information on the cause of Fanny\u2019s death. She must\r\nsuspect, and guess, and chafe, and bear it all alone.\r\n\r\nLike a homeless wanderer she lingered by the bank, as if lulled and\r\nfascinated by the atmosphere of content which seemed to spread from\r\nthat little dwelling, and was so sadly lacking in her own. Gabriel\r\nappeared in an upper room, placed his light in the window-bench, and\r\nthen\u2014knelt down to pray. The contrast of the picture with her\r\nrebellious and agitated existence at this same time was too much for\r\nher to bear to look upon longer. It was not for her to make a truce\r\nwith trouble by any such means. She must tread her giddy distracting\r\nmeasure to its last note, as she had begun it. With a swollen heart she\r\nwent again up the lane, and entered her own door.\r\n\r\nMore fevered now by a reaction from the first feelings which Oak\u2019s\r\nexample had raised in her, she paused in the hall, looking at the door\r\nof the room wherein Fanny lay. She locked her fingers, threw back her\r\nhead, and strained her hot hands rigidly across her forehead, saying,\r\nwith a hysterical sob, \u201CWould to God you would speak and tell me your\r\nsecret, Fanny!... Oh, I hope, hope it is not true that there are two of\r\nyou!... If I could only look in upon you for one little minute, I\r\nshould know all!\u201D\r\n\r\nA few moments passed, and she added, slowly, \u201C_And I will_.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba in after times could never gauge the mood which carried her\r\nthrough the actions following this murmured resolution on this\r\nmemorable evening of her life. She went to the lumber-closet for a\r\nscrew-driver. At the end of a short though undefined time she found\r\nherself in the small room, quivering with emotion, a mist before her\r\neyes, and an excruciating pulsation in her brain, standing beside the\r\nuncovered coffin of the girl whose conjectured end had so entirely\r\nengrossed her, and saying to herself in a husky voice as she gazed\r\nwithin\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was best to know the worst, and I know it now!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was conscious of having brought about this situation by a series of\r\nactions done as by one in an extravagant dream; of following that idea\r\nas to method, which had burst upon her in the hall with glaring\r\nobviousness, by gliding to the top of the stairs, assuring herself by\r\nlistening to the heavy breathing of her maids that they were asleep,\r\ngliding down again, turning the handle of the door within which the\r\nyoung girl lay, and deliberately setting herself to do what, if she had\r\nanticipated any such undertaking at night and alone, would have\r\nhorrified her, but which, when done, was not so dreadful as was the\r\nconclusive proof of her husband\u2019s conduct which came with knowing\r\nbeyond doubt the last chapter of Fanny\u2019s story.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\u2019s head sank upon her bosom, and the breath which had been\r\nbated in suspense, curiosity, and interest, was exhaled now in the form\r\nof a whispered wail: \u201COh-h-h!\u201D she said, and the silent room added\r\nlength to her moan.\r\n\r\nHer tears fell fast beside the unconscious pair in the coffin: tears of\r\na complicated origin, of a nature indescribable, almost indefinable\r\nexcept as other than those of simple sorrow. Assuredly their wonted\r\nfires must have lived in Fanny\u2019s ashes when events were so shaped as to\r\nchariot her hither in this natural, unobtrusive, yet effectual manner.\r\nThe one feat alone\u2014that of dying\u2014by which a mean condition could be\r\nresolved into a grand one, Fanny had achieved. And to that had destiny\r\nsubjoined this reencounter to-night, which had, in Bathsheba\u2019s wild\r\nimagining, turned her companion\u2019s failure to success, her humiliation\r\nto triumph, her lucklessness to ascendency; it had thrown over herself\r\na garish light of mockery, and set upon all things about her an\r\nironical smile.\r\n\r\nFanny\u2019s face was framed in by that yellow hair of hers; and there was\r\nno longer much room for doubt as to the origin of the curl owned by\r\nTroy. In Bathsheba\u2019s heated fancy the innocent white countenance\r\nexpressed a dim triumphant consciousness of the pain she was\r\nretaliating for her pain with all the merciless rigour of the Mosaic\r\nlaw: \u201CBurning for burning; wound for wound: strife for strife.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba indulged in contemplations of escape from her position by\r\nimmediate death, which, thought she, though it was an inconvenient and\r\nawful way, had limits to its inconvenience and awfulness that could not\r\nbe overpassed; whilst the shames of life were measureless. Yet even\r\nthis scheme of extinction by death was but tamely copying her rival\u2019s\r\nmethod without the reasons which had glorified it in her rival\u2019s case.\r\nShe glided rapidly up and down the room, as was mostly her habit when\r\nexcited, her hands hanging clasped in front of her, as she thought and\r\nin part expressed in broken words: \u201CO, I hate her, yet I don\u2019t mean\r\nthat I hate her, for it is grievous and wicked; and yet I hate her a\r\nlittle! Yes, my flesh insists upon hating her, whether my spirit is\r\nwilling or no!... If she had only lived, I could have been angry and\r\ncruel towards her with some justification; but to be vindictive towards\r\na poor dead woman recoils upon myself. O God, have mercy! I am\r\nmiserable at all this!\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba became at this moment so terrified at her own state of mind\r\nthat she looked around for some sort of refuge from herself. The vision\r\nof Oak kneeling down that night recurred to her, and with the imitative\r\ninstinct which animates women she seized upon the idea, resolved to\r\nkneel, and, if possible, pray. Gabriel had prayed; so would she.\r\n\r\nShe knelt beside the coffin, covered her face with her hands, and for a\r\ntime the room was silent as a tomb. Whether from a purely mechanical,\r\nor from any other cause, when Bathsheba arose it was with a quieted\r\nspirit, and a regret for the antagonistic instincts which had seized\r\nupon her just before.\r\n\r\nIn her desire to make atonement she took flowers from a vase by the\r\nwindow, and began laying them around the dead girl\u2019s head. Bathsheba\r\nknew no other way of showing kindness to persons departed than by\r\ngiving them flowers. She knew not how long she remained engaged thus.\r\nShe forgot time, life, where she was, what she was doing. A slamming\r\ntogether of the coach-house doors in the yard brought her to herself\r\nagain. An instant after, the front door opened and closed, steps\r\ncrossed the hall, and her husband appeared at the entrance to the room,\r\nlooking in upon her.\r\n\r\nHe beheld it all by degrees, stared in stupefaction at the scene, as if\r\nhe thought it an illusion raised by some fiendish incantation.\r\nBathsheba, pallid as a corpse on end, gazed back at him in the same\r\nwild way.\r\n\r\nSo little are instinctive guesses the fruit of a legitimate induction\r\nthat, at this moment, as he stood with the door in his hand, Troy never\r\nonce thought of Fanny in connection with what he saw. His first\r\nconfused idea was that somebody in the house had died.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell\u2014what?\u201D said Troy, blankly.\r\n\r\n\u201CI must go! I must go!\u201D said Bathsheba, to herself more than to him.\r\nShe came with a dilated eye towards the door, to push past him.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the matter, in God\u2019s name? who\u2019s dead?\u201D said Troy.\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot say; let me go out. I want air!\u201D she continued.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut no; stay, I insist!\u201D He seized her hand, and then volition seemed\r\nto leave her, and she went off into a state of passivity. He, still\r\nholding her, came up the room, and thus, hand in hand, Troy and\r\nBathsheba approached the coffin\u2019s side.\r\n\r\nThe candle was standing on a bureau close by them, and the light\r\nslanted down, distinctly enkindling the cold features of both mother\r\nand babe. Troy looked in, dropped his wife\u2019s hand, knowledge of it all\r\ncame over him in a lurid sheen, and he stood still.\r\n\r\nSo still he remained that he could be imagined to have left in him no\r\nmotive power whatever. The clashes of feeling in all directions\r\nconfounded one another, produced a neutrality, and there was motion in\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know her?\u201D said Bathsheba, in a small enclosed echo, as from\r\nthe interior of a cell.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do,\u201D said Troy.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs it she?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe had originally stood perfectly erect. And now, in the well-nigh\r\ncongealed immobility of his frame could be discerned an incipient\r\nmovement, as in the darkest night may be discerned light after a while.\r\nHe was gradually sinking forwards. The lines of his features softened,\r\nand dismay modulated to illimitable sadness. Bathsheba was regarding\r\nhim from the other side, still with parted lips and distracted eyes.\r\nCapacity for intense feeling is proportionate to the general intensity\r\nof the nature, and perhaps in all Fanny\u2019s sufferings, much greater\r\nrelatively to her strength, there never was a time she suffered in an\r\nabsolute sense what Bathsheba suffered now.\r\n\r\nWhat Troy did was to sink upon his knees with an indefinable union of\r\nremorse and reverence upon his face, and, bending over Fanny Robin,\r\ngently kissed her, as one would kiss an infant asleep to avoid\r\nawakening it.\r\n\r\nAt the sight and sound of that, to her, unendurable act, Bathsheba\r\nsprang towards him. All the strong feelings which had been scattered\r\nover her existence since she knew what feeling was, seemed gathered\r\ntogether into one pulsation now. The revulsion from her indignant mood\r\na little earlier, when she had meditated upon compromised honour,\r\nforestalment, eclipse in maternity by another, was violent and entire.\r\nAll that was forgotten in the simple and still strong attachment of\r\nwife to husband. She had sighed for her self-completeness then, and now\r\nshe cried aloud against the severance of the union she had deplored.\r\nShe flung her arms round Troy\u2019s neck, exclaiming wildly from the\r\ndeepest deep of her heart\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t kiss them! O, Frank, I can\u2019t bear it\u2014I can\u2019t! I love you\r\nbetter than she did: kiss me too, Frank\u2014kiss me! _You will, Frank, kiss\r\nme too!_\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was something so abnormal and startling in the childlike pain and\r\nsimplicity of this appeal from a woman of Bathsheba\u2019s calibre and\r\nindependence, that Troy, loosening her tightly clasped arms from his\r\nneck, looked at her in bewilderment. It was such an unexpected\r\nrevelation of all women being alike at heart, even those so different\r\nin their accessories as Fanny and this one beside him, that Troy could\r\nhardly seem to believe her to be his proud wife Bathsheba. Fanny\u2019s own\r\nspirit seemed to be animating her frame. But this was the mood of a few\r\ninstants only. When the momentary surprise had passed, his expression\r\nchanged to a silencing imperious gaze.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will not kiss you!\u201D he said pushing her away.\r\n\r\nHad the wife now but gone no further. Yet, perhaps, under the harrowing\r\ncircumstances, to speak out was the one wrong act which can be better\r\nunderstood, if not forgiven in her, than the right and politic one, her\r\nrival being now but a corpse. All the feeling she had been betrayed\r\ninto showing she drew back to herself again by a strenuous effort of\r\nself-command.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat have you to say as your reason?\u201D she asked, her bitter voice\r\nbeing strangely low\u2014quite that of another woman now.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have to say that I have been a bad, black-hearted man,\u201D he answered.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd that this woman is your victim; and I not less than she.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! don\u2019t taunt me, madam. This woman is more to me, dead as she is,\r\nthan ever you were, or are, or can be. If Satan had not tempted me with\r\nthat face of yours, and those cursed coquetries, I should have married\r\nher. I never had another thought till you came in my way. Would to God\r\nthat I had; but it is all too late!\u201D He turned to Fanny then. \u201CBut\r\nnever mind, darling,\u201D he said; \u201Cin the sight of Heaven you are my very,\r\nvery wife!\u201D\r\n\r\nAt these words there arose from Bathsheba\u2019s lips a long, low cry of\r\nmeasureless despair and indignation, such a wail of anguish as had\r\nnever before been heard within those old-inhabited walls. It was the\r\n\u03A4\u03B5\u03C4\u03AD\u03BB\u03B5\u03C3\u03C4\u03B1\u03B9[*] of her union with Troy.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf she\u2019s\u2014that,\u2014what\u2014am I?\u201D she added, as a continuation of the same\r\ncry, and sobbing pitifully: and the rarity with her of such abandonment\r\nonly made the condition more dire.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are nothing to me\u2014nothing,\u201D said Troy, heartlessly. \u201CA ceremony\r\nbefore a priest doesn\u2019t make a marriage. I am not morally yours.\u201D\r\n\r\nA vehement impulse to flee from him, to run from this place, hide, and\r\nescape his words at any price, not stopping short of death itself,\r\nmastered Bathsheba now. She waited not an instant, but turned to the\r\ndoor and ran out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\nUNDER A TREE\u2014REACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nBathsheba went along the dark road, neither knowing nor caring about\r\nthe direction or issue of her flight. The first time that she\r\ndefinitely noticed her position was when she reached a gate leading\r\ninto a thicket overhung by some large oak and beech trees. On looking\r\ninto the place, it occurred to her that she had seen it by daylight on\r\nsome previous occasion, and that what appeared like an impassable\r\nthicket was in reality a brake of fern now withering fast. She could\r\nthink of nothing better to do with her palpitating self than to go in\r\nhere and hide; and entering, she lighted on a spot sheltered from the\r\ndamp fog by a reclining trunk, where she sank down upon a tangled couch\r\nof fronds and stems. She mechanically pulled some armfuls round her to\r\nkeep off the breezes, and closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nWhether she slept or not that night Bathsheba was not clearly aware.\r\nBut it was with a freshened existence and a cooler brain that, a long\r\ntime afterwards, she became conscious of some interesting proceedings\r\nwhich were going on in the trees above her head and around.\r\n\r\nA coarse-throated chatter was the first sound.\r\n\r\nIt was a sparrow just waking.\r\n\r\nNext: \u201CChee-weeze-weeze-weeze!\u201D from another retreat.\r\n\r\nIt was a finch.\r\n\r\nThird: \u201CTink-tink-tink-tink-a-chink!\u201D from the hedge.\r\n\r\nIt was a robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CChuck-chuck-chuck!\u201D overhead.\r\n\r\nA squirrel.\r\n\r\nThen, from the road, \u201CWith my ra-ta-ta, and my rum-tum-tum!\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was a ploughboy. Presently he came opposite, and she believed from\r\nhis voice that he was one of the boys on her own farm. He was followed\r\nby a shambling tramp of heavy feet, and looking through the ferns\r\nBathsheba could just discern in the wan light of daybreak a team of her\r\nown horses. They stopped to drink at a pond on the other side of the\r\nway. She watched them flouncing into the pool, drinking, tossing up\r\ntheir heads, drinking again, the water dribbling from their lips in\r\nsilver threads. There was another flounce, and they came out of the\r\npond, and turned back again towards the farm.\r\n\r\nShe looked further around. Day was just dawning, and beside its cool\r\nair and colours her heated actions and resolves of the night stood out\r\nin lurid contrast. She perceived that in her lap, and clinging to her\r\nhair, were red and yellow leaves which had come down from the tree and\r\nsettled silently upon her during her partial sleep. Bathsheba shook her\r\ndress to get rid of them, when multitudes of the same family lying\r\nround about her rose and fluttered away in the breeze thus created,\r\n\u201Clike ghosts from an enchanter fleeing.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was an opening towards the east, and the glow from the as yet\r\nunrisen sun attracted her eyes thither. From her feet, and between the\r\nbeautiful yellowing ferns with their feathery arms, the ground sloped\r\ndownwards to a hollow, in which was a species of swamp, dotted with\r\nfungi. A morning mist hung over it now\u2014a fulsome yet magnificent\r\nsilvery veil, full of light from the sun, yet semi-opaque\u2014the hedge\r\nbehind it being in some measure hidden by its hazy luminousness. Up the\r\nsides of this depression grew sheaves of the common rush, and here and\r\nthere a peculiar species of flag, the blades of which glistened in the\r\nemerging sun, like scythes. But the general aspect of the swamp was\r\nmalignant. From its moist and poisonous coat seemed to be exhaled the\r\nessences of evil things in the earth, and in the waters under the\r\nearth. The fungi grew in all manner of positions from rotting leaves\r\nand tree stumps, some exhibiting to her listless gaze their clammy\r\ntops, others their oozing gills. Some were marked with great splotches,\r\nred as arterial blood, others were saffron yellow, and others tall and\r\nattenuated, with stems like macaroni. Some were leathery and of richest\r\nbrowns. The hollow seemed a nursery of pestilences small and great, in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood of comfort and health, and Bathsheba arose\r\nwith a tremor at the thought of having passed the night on the brink of\r\nso dismal a place.\r\n\r\nThere were now other footsteps to be heard along the road. Bathsheba\u2019s\r\nnerves were still unstrung: she crouched down out of sight again, and\r\nthe pedestrian came into view. He was a schoolboy, with a bag slung\r\nover his shoulder containing his dinner, and a book in his hand. He\r\npaused by the gate, and, without looking up, continued murmuring words\r\nin tones quite loud enough to reach her ears.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord\u2019:\u2014that I know out o\u2019 book.\r\n\u2018Give us, give us, give us, give us, give us\u2019:\u2014that I know. \u2018Grace\r\nthat, grace that, grace that, grace that\u2019:\u2014that I know.\u201D Other words\r\nfollowed to the same effect. The boy was of the dunce class apparently;\r\nthe book was a psalter, and this was his way of learning the collect.\r\nIn the worst attacks of trouble there appears to be always a\r\nsuperficial film of consciousness which is left disengaged and open to\r\nthe notice of trifles, and Bathsheba was faintly amused at the boy\u2019s\r\nmethod, till he too passed on.\r\n\r\nBy this time stupor had given place to anxiety, and anxiety began to\r\nmake room for hunger and thirst. A form now appeared upon the rise on\r\nthe other side of the swamp, half-hidden by the mist, and came towards\r\nBathsheba. The woman\u2014for it was a woman\u2014approached with her face\r\naskance, as if looking earnestly on all sides of her. When she got a\r\nlittle further round to the left, and drew nearer, Bathsheba could see\r\nthe newcomer\u2019s profile against the sunny sky, and knew the wavy sweep\r\nfrom forehead to chin, with neither angle nor decisive line anywhere\r\nabout it, to be the familiar contour of Liddy Smallbury.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\u2019s heart bounded with gratitude in the thought that she was\r\nnot altogether deserted, and she jumped up. \u201COh, Liddy!\u201D she said, or\r\nattempted to say; but the words had only been framed by her lips; there\r\ncame no sound. She had lost her voice by exposure to the clogged\r\natmosphere all these hours of night.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, ma\u2019am! I am so glad I have found you,\u201D said the girl, as soon as\r\nshe saw Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou can\u2019t come across,\u201D Bathsheba said in a whisper, which she vainly\r\nendeavoured to make loud enough to reach Liddy\u2019s ears. Liddy, not\r\nknowing this, stepped down upon the swamp, saying, as she did so, \u201CIt\r\nwill bear me up, I think.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba never forgot that transient little picture of Liddy crossing\r\nthe swamp to her there in the morning light. Iridescent bubbles of dank\r\nsubterranean breath rose from the sweating sod beside the\r\nwaiting-maid\u2019s feet as she trod, hissing as they burst and expanded\r\naway to join the vapoury firmament above. Liddy did not sink, as\r\nBathsheba had anticipated.\r\n\r\nShe landed safely on the other side, and looked up at the beautiful\r\nthough pale and weary face of her young mistress.\r\n\r\n\u201CPoor thing!\u201D said Liddy, with tears in her eyes, \u201CDo hearten yourself\r\nup a little, ma\u2019am. However did\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t speak above a whisper\u2014my voice is gone for the present,\u201D said\r\nBathsheba, hurriedly. \u201CI suppose the damp air from that hollow has\r\ntaken it away. Liddy, don\u2019t question me, mind. Who sent you\u2014anybody?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNobody. I thought, when I found you were not at home, that something\r\ncruel had happened. I fancy I heard his voice late last night; and so,\r\nknowing something was wrong\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs he at home?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; he left just before I came out.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs Fanny taken away?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot yet. She will soon be\u2014at nine o\u2019clock.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe won\u2019t go home at present, then. Suppose we walk about in this\r\nwood?\u201D\r\n\r\nLiddy, without exactly understanding everything, or anything, in this\r\nepisode, assented, and they walked together further among the trees.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you had better come in, ma\u2019am, and have something to eat. You will\r\ndie of a chill!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI shall not come indoors yet\u2014perhaps never.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShall I get you something to eat, and something else to put over your\r\nhead besides that little shawl?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you will, Liddy.\u201D\r\n\r\nLiddy vanished, and at the end of twenty minutes returned with a cloak,\r\nhat, some slices of bread and butter, a tea-cup, and some hot tea in a\r\nlittle china jug.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs Fanny gone?\u201D said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D said her companion, pouring out the tea.\r\n\r\nBathsheba wrapped herself up and ate and drank sparingly. Her voice was\r\nthen a little clearer, and trifling colour returned to her face. \u201CNow\r\nwe\u2019ll walk about again,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\nThey wandered about the wood for nearly two hours, Bathsheba replying\r\nin monosyllables to Liddy\u2019s prattle, for her mind ran on one subject,\r\nand one only. She interrupted with\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CI wonder if Fanny is gone by this time?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will go and see.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe came back with the information that the men were just taking away\r\nthe corpse; that Bathsheba had been inquired for; that she had replied\r\nto the effect that her mistress was unwell and could not be seen.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen they think I am in my bedroom?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D Liddy then ventured to add: \u201CYou said when I first found you\r\nthat you might never go home again\u2014you didn\u2019t mean it, ma\u2019am?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; I\u2019ve altered my mind. It is only women with no pride in them who\r\nrun away from their husbands. There is one position worse than that of\r\nbeing found dead in your husband\u2019s house from his ill usage, and that\r\nis, to be found alive through having gone away to the house of somebody\r\nelse. I\u2019ve thought of it all this morning, and I\u2019ve chosen my course. A\r\nrunaway wife is an encumbrance to everybody, a burden to herself and a\r\nbyword\u2014all of which make up a heap of misery greater than any that\r\ncomes by staying at home\u2014though this may include the trifling items of\r\ninsult, beating, and starvation. Liddy, if ever you marry\u2014God forbid\r\nthat you ever should!\u2014you\u2019ll find yourself in a fearful situation; but\r\nmind this, don\u2019t you flinch. Stand your ground, and be cut to pieces.\r\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, mistress, don\u2019t talk so!\u201D said Liddy, taking her hand; \u201Cbut I knew\r\nyou had too much sense to bide away. May I ask what dreadful thing it\r\nis that has happened between you and him?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou may ask; but I may not tell.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn about ten minutes they returned to the house by a circuitous route,\r\nentering at the rear. Bathsheba glided up the back stairs to a disused\r\nattic, and her companion followed.\r\n\r\n\u201CLiddy,\u201D she said, with a lighter heart, for youth and hope had begun\r\nto reassert themselves; \u201Cyou are to be my confidante for the\r\npresent\u2014somebody must be\u2014and I choose you. Well, I shall take up my\r\nabode here for a while. Will you get a fire lighted, put down a piece\r\nof carpet, and help me to make the place comfortable. Afterwards, I\r\nwant you and Maryann to bring up that little stump bedstead in the\r\nsmall room, and the bed belonging to it, and a table, and some other\r\nthings.... What shall I do to pass the heavy time away?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHemming handkerchiefs is a very good thing,\u201D said Liddy.\r\n\r\n\u201COh no, no! I hate needlework\u2014I always did.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CKnitting?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd that, too.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou might finish your sampler. Only the carnations and peacocks want\r\nfilling in; and then it could be framed and glazed, and hung beside\r\nyour aunt\u2019s ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSamplers are out of date\u2014horribly countrified. No Liddy, I\u2019ll read.\r\nBring up some books\u2014not new ones. I haven\u2019t heart to read anything\r\nnew.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSome of your uncle\u2019s old ones, ma\u2019am?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. Some of those we stowed away in boxes.\u201D A faint gleam of humour\r\npassed over her face as she said: \u201CBring Beaumont and Fletcher\u2019s\r\n_Maid\u2019s Tragedy_, and the _Mourning Bride_, and\u2014let me see\u2014_Night\r\nThoughts_, and the _Vanity of Human Wishes_.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd that story of the black man, who murdered his wife Desdemona? It\r\nis a nice dismal one that would suit you excellent just now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, Liddy, you\u2019ve been looking into my books without telling me; and\r\nI said you were not to! How do you know it would suit me? It wouldn\u2019t\r\nsuit me at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut if the others do\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, they don\u2019t; and I won\u2019t read dismal books. Why should I read\r\ndismal books, indeed? Bring me _Love in a Village_, and _Maid of the\r\nMill_, and _Doctor Syntax_, and some volumes of the _Spectator_.\u201D\r\n\r\nAll that day Bathsheba and Liddy lived in the attic in a state of\r\nbarricade; a precaution which proved to be needless as against Troy,\r\nfor he did not appear in the neighbourhood or trouble them at all.\r\nBathsheba sat at the window till sunset, sometimes attempting to read,\r\nat other times watching every movement outside without much purpose,\r\nand listening without much interest to every sound.\r\n\r\nThe sun went down almost blood-red that night, and a livid cloud\r\nreceived its rays in the east. Up against this dark background the west\r\nfront of the church tower\u2014the only part of the edifice visible from the\r\nfarm-house windows\u2014rose distinct and lustrous, the vane upon the summit\r\nbristling with rays. Hereabouts, at six o\u2019clock, the young men of the\r\nvillage gathered, as was their custom, for a game of Prisoners\u2019 base.\r\nThe spot had been consecrated to this ancient diversion from time\r\nimmemorial, the old stocks conveniently forming a base facing the\r\nboundary of the churchyard, in front of which the ground was trodden\r\nhard and bare as a pavement by the players. She could see the brown and\r\nblack heads of the young lads darting about right and left, their white\r\nshirt-sleeves gleaming in the sun; whilst occasionally a shout and a\r\npeal of hearty laughter varied the stillness of the evening air. They\r\ncontinued playing for a quarter of an hour or so, when the game\r\nconcluded abruptly, and the players leapt over the wall and vanished\r\nround to the other side behind a yew-tree, which was also half behind a\r\nbeech, now spreading in one mass of golden foliage, on which the\r\nbranches traced black lines.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy did the base-players finish their game so suddenly?\u201D Bathsheba\r\ninquired, the next time that Liddy entered the room.\r\n\r\n\u201CI think \u2019twas because two men came just then from Casterbridge and\r\nbegan putting up a grand carved tombstone,\u201D said Liddy. \u201CThe lads went\r\nto see whose it was.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know?\u201D Bathsheba asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t,\u201D said Liddy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\nTROY\u2019S ROMANTICISM\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Troy\u2019s wife had left the house at the previous midnight his first\r\nact was to cover the dead from sight. This done he ascended the stairs,\r\nand throwing himself down upon the bed dressed as he was, he waited\r\nmiserably for the morning.\r\n\r\nFate had dealt grimly with him through the last four-and-twenty hours.\r\nHis day had been spent in a way which varied very materially from his\r\nintentions regarding it. There is always an inertia to be overcome in\r\nstriking out a new line of conduct\u2014not more in ourselves, it seems,\r\nthan in circumscribing events, which appear as if leagued together to\r\nallow no novelties in the way of amelioration.\r\n\r\nTwenty pounds having been secured from Bathsheba, he had managed to add\r\nto the sum every farthing he could muster on his own account, which had\r\nbeen seven pounds ten. With this money, twenty-seven pounds ten in all,\r\nhe had hastily driven from the gate that morning to keep his\r\nappointment with Fanny Robin.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Casterbridge he left the horse and trap at an inn, and at\r\nfive minutes before ten came back to the bridge at the lower end of the\r\ntown, and sat himself upon the parapet. The clocks struck the hour, and\r\nno Fanny appeared. In fact, at that moment she was being robed in her\r\ngrave-clothes by two attendants at the Union poorhouse\u2014the first and\r\nlast tiring-women the gentle creature had ever been honoured with. The\r\nquarter went, the half hour. A rush of recollection came upon Troy as\r\nhe waited: this was the second time she had broken a serious engagement\r\nwith him. In anger he vowed it should be the last, and at eleven\r\no\u2019clock, when he had lingered and watched the stone of the bridge till\r\nhe knew every lichen upon their face and heard the chink of the ripples\r\nunderneath till they oppressed him, he jumped from his seat, went to\r\nthe inn for his gig, and in a bitter mood of indifference concerning\r\nthe past, and recklessness about the future, drove on to Budmouth\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nHe reached the race-course at two o\u2019clock, and remained either there or\r\nin the town till nine. But Fanny\u2019s image, as it had appeared to him in\r\nthe sombre shadows of that Saturday evening, returned to his mind,\r\nbacked up by Bathsheba\u2019s reproaches. He vowed he would not bet, and he\r\nkept his vow, for on leaving the town at nine o\u2019clock in the evening he\r\nhad diminished his cash only to the extent of a few shillings.\r\n\r\nHe trotted slowly homeward, and it was now that he was struck for the\r\nfirst time with a thought that Fanny had been really prevented by\r\nillness from keeping her promise. This time she could have made no\r\nmistake. He regretted that he had not remained in Casterbridge and made\r\ninquiries. Reaching home he quietly unharnessed the horse and came\r\nindoors, as we have seen, to the fearful shock that awaited him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it grew light enough to distinguish objects, Troy arose from\r\nthe coverlet of the bed, and in a mood of absolute indifference to\r\nBathsheba\u2019s whereabouts, and almost oblivious of her existence, he\r\nstalked downstairs and left the house by the back door. His walk was\r\ntowards the churchyard, entering which he searched around till he found\r\na newly dug unoccupied grave\u2014the grave dug the day before for Fanny.\r\nThe position of this having been marked, he hastened on to\r\nCasterbridge, only pausing and musing for a while at the hill whereon\r\nhe had last seen Fanny alive.\r\n\r\nReaching the town, Troy descended into a side street and entered a pair\r\nof gates surmounted by a board bearing the words, \u201CLester, stone and\r\nmarble mason.\u201D Within were lying about stones of all sizes and designs,\r\ninscribed as being sacred to the memory of unnamed persons who had not\r\nyet died.\r\n\r\nTroy was so unlike himself now in look, word, and deed, that the want\r\nof likeness was perceptible even to his own consciousness. His method\r\nof engaging himself in this business of purchasing a tomb was that of\r\nan absolutely unpractised man. He could not bring himself to consider,\r\ncalculate, or economize. He waywardly wished for something, and he set\r\nabout obtaining it like a child in a nursery. \u201CI want a good tomb,\u201D he\r\nsaid to the man who stood in a little office within the yard. \u201CI want\r\nas good a one as you can give me for twenty-seven pounds.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was all the money he possessed.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat sum to include everything?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEverything. Cutting the name, carriage to Weatherbury, and erection.\r\nAnd I want it now, at once.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe could not get anything special worked this week.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI must have it now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you would like one of these in stock it could be got ready\r\nimmediately.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D said Troy, impatiently. \u201CLet\u2019s see what you have.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe best I have in stock is this one,\u201D said the stone-cutter, going\r\ninto a shed. \u201CHere\u2019s a marble headstone beautifully crocketed, with\r\nmedallions beneath of typical subjects; here\u2019s the footstone after the\r\nsame pattern, and here\u2019s the coping to enclose the grave. The polishing\r\nalone of the set cost me eleven pounds\u2014the slabs are the best of their\r\nkind, and I can warrant them to resist rain and frost for a hundred\r\nyears without flying.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd how much?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I could add the name, and put it up at Weatherbury for the sum\r\nyou mention.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGet it done to-day, and I\u2019ll pay the money now.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe man agreed, and wondered at such a mood in a visitor who wore not a\r\nshred of mourning. Troy then wrote the words which were to form the\r\ninscription, settled the account and went away. In the afternoon he\r\ncame back again, and found that the lettering was almost done. He\r\nwaited in the yard till the tomb was packed, and saw it placed in the\r\ncart and starting on its way to Weatherbury, giving directions to the\r\ntwo men who were to accompany it to inquire of the sexton for the grave\r\nof the person named in the inscription.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark when Troy came out of Casterbridge. He carried rather\r\na heavy basket upon his arm, with which he strode moodily along the\r\nroad, resting occasionally at bridges and gates, whereon he deposited\r\nhis burden for a time. Midway on his journey he met, returning in the\r\ndarkness, the men and the waggon which had conveyed the tomb. He merely\r\ninquired if the work was done, and, on being assured that it was,\r\npassed on again.\r\n\r\nTroy entered Weatherbury churchyard about ten o\u2019clock and went\r\nimmediately to the corner where he had marked the vacant grave early in\r\nthe morning. It was on the obscure side of the tower, screened to a\r\ngreat extent from the view of passers along the road\u2014a spot which until\r\nlately had been abandoned to heaps of stones and bushes of alder, but\r\nnow it was cleared and made orderly for interments, by reason of the\r\nrapid filling of the ground elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHere now stood the tomb as the men had stated, snow-white and shapely\r\nin the gloom, consisting of head and foot-stone, and enclosing border\r\nof marble-work uniting them. In the midst was mould, suitable for\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nTroy deposited his basket beside the tomb, and vanished for a few\r\nminutes. When he returned he carried a spade and a lantern, the light\r\nof which he directed for a few moments upon the marble, whilst he read\r\nthe inscription. He hung his lantern on the lowest bough of the\r\nyew-tree, and took from his basket flower-roots of several varieties.\r\nThere were bundles of snow-drop, hyacinth and crocus bulbs, violets and\r\ndouble daisies, which were to bloom in early spring, and of carnations,\r\npinks, picotees, lilies of the valley, forget-me-not, summer\u2019s\r\nfarewell, meadow-saffron and others, for the later seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nTroy laid these out upon the grass, and with an impassive face set to\r\nwork to plant them. The snowdrops were arranged in a line on the\r\noutside of the coping, the remainder within the enclosure of the grave.\r\nThe crocuses and hyacinths were to grow in rows; some of the summer\r\nflowers he placed over her head and feet, the lilies and forget-me-nots\r\nover her heart. The remainder were dispersed in the spaces between\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nTroy, in his prostration at this time, had no perception that in the\r\nfutility of these romantic doings, dictated by a remorseful reaction\r\nfrom previous indifference, there was any element of absurdity.\r\nDeriving his idiosyncrasies from both sides of the Channel, he showed\r\nat such junctures as the present the inelasticity of the Englishman,\r\ntogether with that blindness to the line where sentiment verges on\r\nmawkishness, characteristic of the French.\r\n\r\nIt was a cloudy, muggy, and very dark night, and the rays from Troy\u2019s\r\nlantern spread into the two old yews with a strange illuminating power,\r\nflickering, as it seemed, up to the black ceiling of cloud above. He\r\nfelt a large drop of rain upon the back of his hand, and presently one\r\ncame and entered one of the holes of the lantern, whereupon the candle\r\nsputtered and went out. Troy was weary and it being now not far from\r\nmidnight, and the rain threatening to increase, he resolved to leave\r\nthe finishing touches of his labour until the day should break. He\r\ngroped along the wall and over the graves in the dark till he found\r\nhimself round at the north side. Here he entered the porch, and,\r\nreclining upon the bench within, fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\nTHE GURGOYLE: ITS DOINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tower of Weatherbury Church was a square erection of\r\nfourteenth-century date, having two stone gurgoyles on each of the four\r\nfaces of its parapet. Of these eight carved protuberances only two at\r\nthis time continued to serve the purpose of their erection\u2014that of\r\nspouting the water from the lead roof within. One mouth in each front\r\nhad been closed by bygone church-wardens as superfluous, and two others\r\nwere broken away and choked\u2014a matter not of much consequence to the\r\nwellbeing of the tower, for the two mouths which still remained open\r\nand active were gaping enough to do all the work.\r\n\r\nIt has been sometimes argued that there is no truer criterion of the\r\nvitality of any given art-period than the power of the master-spirits\r\nof that time in grotesque; and certainly in the instance of Gothic art\r\nthere is no disputing the proposition. Weatherbury tower was a somewhat\r\nearly instance of the use of an ornamental parapet in parish as\r\ndistinct from cathedral churches, and the gurgoyles, which are the\r\nnecessary correlatives of a parapet, were exceptionally prominent\u2014of\r\nthe boldest cut that the hand could shape, and of the most original\r\ndesign that a human brain could conceive. There was, so to speak, that\r\nsymmetry in their distortion which is less the characteristic of\r\nBritish than of Continental grotesques of the period. All the eight\r\nwere different from each other. A beholder was convinced that nothing\r\non earth could be more hideous than those he saw on the north side\r\nuntil he went round to the south. Of the two on this latter face, only\r\nthat at the south-eastern corner concerns the story. It was too human\r\nto be called like a dragon, too impish to be like a man, too animal to\r\nbe like a fiend, and not enough like a bird to be called a griffin.\r\nThis horrible stone entity was fashioned as if covered with a wrinkled\r\nhide; it had short, erect ears, eyes starting from their sockets, and\r\nits fingers and hands were seizing the corners of its mouth, which they\r\nthus seemed to pull open to give free passage to the water it vomited.\r\nThe lower row of teeth was quite washed away, though the upper still\r\nremained. Here and thus, jutting a couple of feet from the wall against\r\nwhich its feet rested as a support, the creature had for four hundred\r\nyears laughed at the surrounding landscape, voicelessly in dry weather,\r\nand in wet with a gurgling and snorting sound.\r\n\r\nTroy slept on in the porch, and the rain increased outside. Presently\r\nthe gurgoyle spat. In due time a small stream began to trickle through\r\nthe seventy feet of aerial space between its mouth and the ground,\r\nwhich the water-drops smote like duckshot in their accelerated\r\nvelocity. The stream thickened in substance, and increased in power,\r\ngradually spouting further and yet further from the side of the tower.\r\nWhen the rain fell in a steady and ceaseless torrent the stream dashed\r\ndownward in volumes.\r\n\r\nWe follow its course to the ground at this point of time. The end of\r\nthe liquid parabola has come forward from the wall, has advanced over\r\nthe plinth mouldings, over a heap of stones, over the marble border,\r\ninto the midst of Fanny Robin\u2019s grave.\r\n\r\nThe force of the stream had, until very lately, been received upon some\r\nloose stones spread thereabout, which had acted as a shield to the soil\r\nunder the onset. These during the summer had been cleared from the\r\nground, and there was now nothing to resist the down-fall but the bare\r\nearth. For several years the stream had not spouted so far from the\r\ntower as it was doing on this night, and such a contingency had been\r\nover-looked. Sometimes this obscure corner received no inhabitant for\r\nthe space of two or three years, and then it was usually but a pauper,\r\na poacher, or other sinner of undignified sins.\r\n\r\nThe persistent torrent from the gurgoyle\u2019s jaws directed all its\r\nvengeance into the grave. The rich tawny mould was stirred into motion,\r\nand boiled like chocolate. The water accumulated and washed deeper\r\ndown, and the roar of the pool thus formed spread into the night as the\r\nhead and chief among other noises of the kind created by the deluging\r\nrain. The flowers so carefully planted by Fanny\u2019s repentant lover began\r\nto move and writhe in their bed. The winter-violets turned slowly\r\nupside down, and became a mere mat of mud. Soon the snowdrop and other\r\nbulbs danced in the boiling mass like ingredients in a cauldron. Plants\r\nof the tufted species were loosened, rose to the surface, and floated\r\noff.\r\n\r\nTroy did not awake from his comfortless sleep till it was broad day.\r\nNot having been in bed for two nights his shoulders felt stiff, his\r\nfeet tender, and his head heavy. He remembered his position, arose,\r\nshivered, took the spade, and again went out.\r\n\r\nThe rain had quite ceased, and the sun was shining through the green,\r\nbrown, and yellow leaves, now sparkling and varnished by the raindrops\r\nto the brightness of similar effects in the landscapes of Ruysdael and\r\nHobbema, and full of all those infinite beauties that arise from the\r\nunion of water and colour with high lights. The air was rendered so\r\ntransparent by the heavy fall of rain that the autumn hues of the\r\nmiddle distance were as rich as those near at hand, and the remote\r\nfields intercepted by the angle of the tower appeared in the same plane\r\nas the tower itself.\r\n\r\nHe entered the gravel path which would take him behind the tower. The\r\npath, instead of being stony as it had been the night before, was\r\nbrowned over with a thin coating of mud. At one place in the path he\r\nsaw a tuft of stringy roots washed white and clean as a bundle of\r\ntendons. He picked it up\u2014surely it could not be one of the primroses he\r\nhad planted? He saw a bulb, another, and another as he advanced. Beyond\r\ndoubt they were the crocuses. With a face of perplexed dismay Troy\r\nturned the corner and then beheld the wreck the stream had made.\r\n\r\nThe pool upon the grave had soaked away into the ground, and in its\r\nplace was a hollow. The disturbed earth was washed over the grass and\r\npathway in the guise of the brown mud he had already seen, and it\r\nspotted the marble tombstone with the same stains. Nearly all the\r\nflowers were washed clean out of the ground, and they lay, roots\r\nupwards, on the spots whither they had been splashed by the stream.\r\n\r\nTroy\u2019s brow became heavily contracted. He set his teeth closely, and\r\nhis compressed lips moved as those of one in great pain. This singular\r\naccident, by a strange confluence of emotions in him, was felt as the\r\nsharpest sting of all. Troy\u2019s face was very expressive, and any\r\nobserver who had seen him now would hardly have believed him to be a\r\nman who had laughed, and sung, and poured love-trifles into a woman\u2019s\r\near. To curse his miserable lot was at first his impulse, but even that\r\nlowest stage of rebellion needed an activity whose absence was\r\nnecessarily antecedent to the existence of the morbid misery which\r\nwrung him. The sight, coming as it did, superimposed upon the other\r\ndark scenery of the previous days, formed a sort of climax to the whole\r\npanorama, and it was more than he could endure. Sanguine by nature,\r\nTroy had a power of eluding grief by simply adjourning it. He could put\r\noff the consideration of any particular spectre till the matter had\r\nbecome old and softened by time. The planting of flowers on Fanny\u2019s\r\ngrave had been perhaps but a species of elusion of the primary grief,\r\nand now it was as if his intention had been known and circumvented.\r\n\r\nAlmost for the first time in his life, Troy, as he stood by this\r\ndismantled grave, wished himself another man. It is seldom that a\r\nperson with much animal spirit does not feel that the fact of his life\r\nbeing his own is the one qualification which singles it out as a more\r\nhopeful life than that of others who may actually resemble him in every\r\nparticular. Troy had felt, in his transient way, hundreds of times,\r\nthat he could not envy other people their condition, because the\r\npossession of that condition would have necessitated a different\r\npersonality, when he desired no other than his own. He had not minded\r\nthe peculiarities of his birth, the vicissitudes of his life, the\r\nmeteor-like uncertainty of all that related to him, because these\r\nappertained to the hero of his story, without whom there would have\r\nbeen no story at all for him; and it seemed to be only in the nature of\r\nthings that matters would right themselves at some proper date and wind\r\nup well. This very morning the illusion completed its disappearance,\r\nand, as it were, all of a sudden, Troy hated himself. The suddenness\r\nwas probably more apparent than real. A coral reef which just comes\r\nshort of the ocean surface is no more to the horizon than if it had\r\nnever been begun, and the mere finishing stroke is what often appears\r\nto create an event which has long been potentially an accomplished\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nHe stood and meditated\u2014a miserable man. Whither should he go? \u201CHe that\r\nis accursed, let him be accursed still,\u201D was the pitiless anathema\r\nwritten in this spoliated effort of his new-born solicitousness. A man\r\nwho has spent his primal strength in journeying in one direction has\r\nnot much spirit left for reversing his course. Troy had, since\r\nyesterday, faintly reversed his; but the merest opposition had\r\ndisheartened him. To turn about would have been hard enough under the\r\ngreatest providential encouragement; but to find that Providence, far\r\nfrom helping him into a new course, or showing any wish that he might\r\nadopt one, actually jeered his first trembling and critical attempt in\r\nthat kind, was more than nature could bear.\r\n\r\nHe slowly withdrew from the grave. He did not attempt to fill up the\r\nhole, replace the flowers, or do anything at all. He simply threw up\r\nhis cards and forswore his game for that time and always. Going out of\r\nthe churchyard silently and unobserved\u2014none of the villagers having yet\r\nrisen\u2014he passed down some fields at the back, and emerged just as\r\nsecretly upon the high road. Shortly afterwards he had gone from the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Bathsheba remained a voluntary prisoner in the attic. The\r\ndoor was kept locked, except during the entries and exits of Liddy, for\r\nwhom a bed had been arranged in a small adjoining room. The light of\r\nTroy\u2019s lantern in the churchyard was noticed about ten o\u2019clock by the\r\nmaid-servant, who casually glanced from the window in that direction\r\nwhilst taking her supper, and she called Bathsheba\u2019s attention to it.\r\nThey looked curiously at the phenomenon for a time, until Liddy was\r\nsent to bed.\r\n\r\nBathsheba did not sleep very heavily that night. When her attendant was\r\nunconscious and softly breathing in the next room, the mistress of the\r\nhouse was still looking out of the window at the faint gleam spreading\r\nfrom among the trees\u2014not in a steady shine, but blinking like a\r\nrevolving coast-light, though this appearance failed to suggest to her\r\nthat a person was passing and repassing in front of it. Bathsheba sat\r\nhere till it began to rain, and the light vanished, when she withdrew\r\nto lie restlessly in her bed and re-enact in a worn mind the lurid\r\nscene of yesternight.\r\n\r\nAlmost before the first faint sign of dawn appeared she arose again,\r\nand opened the window to obtain a full breathing of the new morning\r\nair, the panes being now wet with trembling tears left by the night\r\nrain, each one rounded with a pale lustre caught from primrose-hued\r\nslashes through a cloud low down in the awakening sky. From the trees\r\ncame the sound of steady dripping upon the drifted leaves under them,\r\nand from the direction of the church she could hear another\r\nnoise\u2014peculiar, and not intermittent like the rest, the purl of water\r\nfalling into a pool.\r\n\r\nLiddy knocked at eight o\u2019clock, and Bathsheba unlocked the door.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a heavy rain we\u2019ve had in the night, ma\u2019am!\u201D said Liddy, when her\r\ninquiries about breakfast had been made.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, very heavy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you hear the strange noise from the churchyard?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI heard one strange noise. I\u2019ve been thinking it must have been the\r\nwater from the tower spouts.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, that\u2019s what the shepherd was saying, ma\u2019am. He\u2019s now gone on to\r\nsee.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh! Gabriel has been here this morning!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COnly just looked in in passing\u2014quite in his old way, which I thought\r\nhe had left off lately. But the tower spouts used to spatter on the\r\nstones, and we are puzzled, for this was like the boiling of a pot.\u201D\r\n\r\nNot being able to read, think, or work, Bathsheba asked Liddy to stay\r\nand breakfast with her. The tongue of the more childish woman still ran\r\nupon recent events. \u201CAre you going across to the church, ma\u2019am?\u201D she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot that I know of,\u201D said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\u201CI thought you might like to go and see where they have put Fanny. The\r\ntrees hide the place from your window.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba had all sorts of dreads about meeting her husband. \u201CHas Mr.\r\nTroy been in to-night?\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, ma\u2019am; I think he\u2019s gone to Budmouth.\u201D\r\n\r\nBudmouth! The sound of the word carried with it a much diminished\r\nperspective of him and his deeds; there were thirteen miles interval\r\nbetwixt them now. She hated questioning Liddy about her husband\u2019s\r\nmovements, and indeed had hitherto sedulously avoided doing so; but now\r\nall the house knew that there had been some dreadful disagreement\r\nbetween them, and it was futile to attempt disguise. Bathsheba had\r\nreached a stage at which people cease to have any appreciative regard\r\nfor public opinion.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat makes you think he has gone there?\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CLaban Tall saw him on the Budmouth road this morning before\r\nbreakfast.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba was momentarily relieved of that wayward heaviness of the\r\npast twenty-four hours which had quenched the vitality of youth in her\r\nwithout substituting the philosophy of maturer years, and she resolved\r\nto go out and walk a little way. So when breakfast was over, she put on\r\nher bonnet, and took a direction towards the church. It was nine\r\no\u2019clock, and the men having returned to work again from their first\r\nmeal, she was not likely to meet many of them in the road. Knowing that\r\nFanny had been laid in the reprobates\u2019 quarter of the graveyard, called\r\nin the parish \u201Cbehind church,\u201D which was invisible from the road, it\r\nwas impossible to resist the impulse to enter and look upon a spot\r\nwhich, from nameless feelings, she at the same time dreaded to see. She\r\nhad been unable to overcome an impression that some connection existed\r\nbetween her rival and the light through the trees.\r\n\r\nBathsheba skirted the buttress, and beheld the hole and the tomb, its\r\ndelicately veined surface splashed and stained just as Troy had seen it\r\nand left it two hours earlier. On the other side of the scene stood\r\nGabriel. His eyes, too, were fixed on the tomb, and her arrival having\r\nbeen noiseless, she had not as yet attracted his attention. Bathsheba\r\ndid not at once perceive that the grand tomb and the disturbed grave\r\nwere Fanny\u2019s, and she looked on both sides and around for some humbler\r\nmound, earthed up and clodded in the usual way. Then her eye followed\r\nOak\u2019s, and she read the words with which the inscription opened:\u2014\r\n\r\nErected by Francis Troy\r\nIn Beloved Memory of\r\nFanny Robin\r\n\r\n\r\nOak saw her, and his first act was to gaze inquiringly and learn how\r\nshe received this knowledge of the authorship of the work, which to\r\nhimself had caused considerable astonishment. But such discoveries did\r\nnot much affect her now. Emotional convulsions seemed to have become\r\nthe commonplaces of her history, and she bade him good morning, and\r\nasked him to fill in the hole with the spade which was standing by.\r\nWhilst Oak was doing as she desired, Bathsheba collected the flowers,\r\nand began planting them with that sympathetic manipulation of roots and\r\nleaves which is so conspicuous in a woman\u2019s gardening, and which\r\nflowers seem to understand and thrive upon. She requested Oak to get\r\nthe churchwardens to turn the leadwork at the mouth of the gurgoyle\r\nthat hung gaping down upon them, that by this means the stream might be\r\ndirected sideways, and a repetition of the accident prevented. Finally,\r\nwith the superfluous magnanimity of a woman whose narrower instincts\r\nhave brought down bitterness upon her instead of love, she wiped the\r\nmud spots from the tomb as if she rather liked its words than\r\notherwise, and went again home.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\nADVENTURES BY THE SHORE\r\n\r\n\r\nTroy wandered along towards the south. A composite feeling, made up of\r\ndisgust with the, to him, humdrum tediousness of a farmer\u2019s life,\r\ngloomy images of her who lay in the churchyard, remorse, and a general\r\naverseness to his wife\u2019s society, impelled him to seek a home in any\r\nplace on earth save Weatherbury. The sad accessories of Fanny\u2019s end\r\nconfronted him as vivid pictures which threatened to be indelible, and\r\nmade life in Bathsheba\u2019s house intolerable. At three in the afternoon\r\nhe found himself at the foot of a slope more than a mile in length,\r\nwhich ran to the ridge of a range of hills lying parallel with the\r\nshore, and forming a monotonous barrier between the basin of cultivated\r\ncountry inland and the wilder scenery of the coast. Up the hill\r\nstretched a road nearly straight and perfectly white, the two sides\r\napproaching each other in a gradual taper till they met the sky at the\r\ntop about two miles off. Throughout the length of this narrow and\r\nirksome inclined plane not a sign of life was visible on this garish\r\nafternoon. Troy toiled up the road with a languor and depression\r\ngreater than any he had experienced for many a day and year before. The\r\nair was warm and muggy, and the top seemed to recede as he approached.\r\n\r\nAt last he reached the summit, and a wide and novel prospect burst upon\r\nhim with an effect almost like that of the Pacific upon Balboa\u2019s gaze.\r\nThe broad steely sea, marked only by faint lines, which had a semblance\r\nof being etched thereon to a degree not deep enough to disturb its\r\ngeneral evenness, stretched the whole width of his front and round to\r\nthe right, where, near the town and port of Budmouth, the sun bristled\r\ndown upon it, and banished all colour, to substitute in its place a\r\nclear oily polish. Nothing moved in sky, land, or sea, except a frill\r\nof milkwhite foam along the nearer angles of the shore, shreds of which\r\nlicked the contiguous stones like tongues.\r\n\r\nHe descended and came to a small basin of sea enclosed by the cliffs.\r\nTroy\u2019s nature freshened within him; he thought he would rest and bathe\r\nhere before going farther. He undressed and plunged in. Inside the cove\r\nthe water was uninteresting to a swimmer, being smooth as a pond, and\r\nto get a little of the ocean swell, Troy presently swam between the two\r\nprojecting spurs of rock which formed the pillars of Hercules to this\r\nminiature Mediterranean. Unfortunately for Troy a current unknown to\r\nhim existed outside, which, unimportant to craft of any burden, was\r\nawkward for a swimmer who might be taken in it unawares. Troy found\r\nhimself carried to the left and then round in a swoop out to sea.\r\n\r\nHe now recollected the place and its sinister character. Many bathers\r\nhad there prayed for a dry death from time to time, and, like Gonzalo\r\nalso, had been unanswered; and Troy began to deem it possible that he\r\nmight be added to their number. Not a boat of any kind was at present\r\nwithin sight, but far in the distance Budmouth lay upon the sea, as it\r\nwere quietly regarding his efforts, and beside the town the harbour\r\nshowed its position by a dim meshwork of ropes and spars. After\r\nwell-nigh exhausting himself in attempts to get back to the mouth of\r\nthe cove, in his weakness swimming several inches deeper than was his\r\nwont, keeping up his breathing entirely by his nostrils, turning upon\r\nhis back a dozen times over, swimming _en papillon_, and so on, Troy\r\nresolved as a last resource to tread water at a slight incline, and so\r\nendeavour to reach the shore at any point, merely giving himself a\r\ngentle impetus inwards whilst carried on in the general direction of\r\nthe tide. This, necessarily a slow process, he found to be not\r\naltogether so difficult, and though there was no choice of a\r\nlanding-place\u2014the objects on shore passing by him in a sad and slow\r\nprocession\u2014he perceptibly approached the extremity of a spit of land\r\nyet further to the right, now well defined against the sunny portion of\r\nthe horizon. While the swimmer\u2019s eyes were fixed upon the spit as his\r\nonly means of salvation on this side of the Unknown, a moving object\r\nbroke the outline of the extremity, and immediately a ship\u2019s boat\r\nappeared manned with several sailor lads, her bows towards the sea.\r\n\r\nAll Troy\u2019s vigour spasmodically revived to prolong the struggle yet a\r\nlittle further. Swimming with his right arm, he held up his left to\r\nhail them, splashing upon the waves, and shouting with all his might.\r\nFrom the position of the setting sun his white form was distinctly\r\nvisible upon the now deep-hued bosom of the sea to the east of the\r\nboat, and the men saw him at once. Backing their oars and putting the\r\nboat about, they pulled towards him with a will, and in five or six\r\nminutes from the time of his first halloo, two of the sailors hauled\r\nhim in over the stern.\r\n\r\nThey formed part of a brig\u2019s crew, and had come ashore for sand.\r\nLending him what little clothing they could spare among them as a\r\nslight protection against the rapidly cooling air, they agreed to land\r\nhim in the morning; and without further delay, for it was growing late,\r\nthey made again towards the roadstead where their vessel lay.\r\n\r\nAnd now night drooped slowly upon the wide watery levels in front; and\r\nat no great distance from them, where the shoreline curved round, and\r\nformed a long riband of shade upon the horizon, a series of points of\r\nyellow light began to start into existence, denoting the spot to be the\r\nsite of Budmouth, where the lamps were being lighted along the parade.\r\nThe cluck of their oars was the only sound of any distinctness upon the\r\nsea, and as they laboured amid the thickening shades the lamp-lights\r\ngrew larger, each appearing to send a flaming sword deep down into the\r\nwaves before it, until there arose, among other dim shapes of the kind,\r\nthe form of the vessel for which they were bound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\nDOUBTS ARISE\u2014DOUBTS LINGER\r\n\r\n\r\nBathsheba underwent the enlargement of her husband\u2019s absence from hours\r\nto days with a slight feeling of surprise, and a slight feeling of\r\nrelief; yet neither sensation rose at any time far above the level\r\ncommonly designated as indifference. She belonged to him: the\r\ncertainties of that position were so well defined, and the reasonable\r\nprobabilities of its issue so bounded that she could not speculate on\r\ncontingencies. Taking no further interest in herself as a splendid\r\nwoman, she acquired the indifferent feelings of an outsider in\r\ncontemplating her probable fate as a singular wretch; for Bathsheba\r\ndrew herself and her future in colours that no reality could exceed for\r\ndarkness. Her original vigorous pride of youth had sickened, and with\r\nit had declined all her anxieties about coming years, since anxiety\r\nrecognizes a better and a worse alternative, and Bathsheba had made up\r\nher mind that alternatives on any noteworthy scale had ceased for her.\r\nSoon, or later\u2014and that not very late\u2014her husband would be home again.\r\nAnd then the days of their tenancy of the Upper Farm would be numbered.\r\nThere had originally been shown by the agent to the estate some\r\ndistrust of Bathsheba\u2019s tenure as James Everdene\u2019s successor, on the\r\nscore of her sex, and her youth, and her beauty; but the peculiar\r\nnature of her uncle\u2019s will, his own frequent testimony before his death\r\nto her cleverness in such a pursuit, and her vigorous marshalling of\r\nthe numerous flocks and herds which came suddenly into her hands before\r\nnegotiations were concluded, had won confidence in her powers, and no\r\nfurther objections had been raised. She had latterly been in great\r\ndoubt as to what the legal effects of her marriage would be upon her\r\nposition; but no notice had been taken as yet of her change of name,\r\nand only one point was clear\u2014that in the event of her own or her\r\nhusband\u2019s inability to meet the agent at the forthcoming January\r\nrent-day, very little consideration would be shown, and, for that\r\nmatter, very little would be deserved. Once out of the farm, the\r\napproach of poverty would be sure.\r\n\r\nHence Bathsheba lived in a perception that her purposes were broken\r\noff. She was not a woman who could hope on without good materials for\r\nthe process, differing thus from the less far-sighted and energetic,\r\nthough more petted ones of the sex, with whom hope goes on as a sort of\r\nclockwork which the merest food and shelter are sufficient to wind up;\r\nand perceiving clearly that her mistake had been a fatal one, she\r\naccepted her position, and waited coldly for the end.\r\n\r\nThe first Saturday after Troy\u2019s departure she went to Casterbridge\r\nalone, a journey she had not before taken since her marriage. On this\r\nSaturday Bathsheba was passing slowly on foot through the crowd of\r\nrural business-men gathered as usual in front of the market-house, who\r\nwere as usual gazed upon by the burghers with feelings that those\r\nhealthy lives were dearly paid for by exclusion from possible\r\naldermanship, when a man, who had apparently been following her, said\r\nsome words to another on her left hand. Bathsheba\u2019s ears were keen as\r\nthose of any wild animal, and she distinctly heard what the speaker\r\nsaid, though her back was towards him.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am looking for Mrs. Troy. Is that she there?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; that\u2019s the young lady, I believe,\u201D said the the person addressed.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have some awkward news to break to her. Her husband is drowned.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs if endowed with the spirit of prophecy, Bathsheba gasped out, \u201CNo,\r\nit is not true; it cannot be true!\u201D Then she said and heard no more.\r\nThe ice of self-command which had latterly gathered over her was\r\nbroken, and the currents burst forth again, and overwhelmed her. A\r\ndarkness came into her eyes, and she fell.\r\n\r\nBut not to the ground. A gloomy man, who had been observing her from\r\nunder the portico of the old corn-exchange when she passed through the\r\ngroup without, stepped quickly to her side at the moment of her\r\nexclamation, and caught her in his arms as she sank down.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is it?\u201D said Boldwood, looking up at the bringer of the big news,\r\nas he supported her.\r\n\r\n\u201CHer husband was drowned this week while bathing in Lulwind Cove. A\r\ncoastguardsman found his clothes, and brought them into Budmouth\r\nyesterday.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon a strange fire lighted up Boldwood\u2019s eye, and his face\r\nflushed with the suppressed excitement of an unutterable thought.\r\nEverybody\u2019s glance was now centred upon him and the unconscious\r\nBathsheba. He lifted her bodily off the ground, and smoothed down the\r\nfolds of her dress as a child might have taken a storm-beaten bird and\r\narranged its ruffled plumes, and bore her along the pavement to the\r\nKing\u2019s Arms Inn. Here he passed with her under the archway into a\r\nprivate room; and by the time he had deposited\u2014so lothly\u2014the precious\r\nburden upon a sofa, Bathsheba had opened her eyes. Remembering all that\r\nhad occurred, she murmured, \u201CI want to go home!\u201D\r\n\r\nBoldwood left the room. He stood for a moment in the passage to recover\r\nhis senses. The experience had been too much for his consciousness to\r\nkeep up with, and now that he had grasped it it had gone again. For\r\nthose few heavenly, golden moments she had been in his arms. What did\r\nit matter about her not knowing it? She had been close to his breast;\r\nhe had been close to hers.\r\n\r\nHe started onward again, and sending a woman to her, went out to\r\nascertain all the facts of the case. These appeared to be limited to\r\nwhat he had already heard. He then ordered her horse to be put into the\r\ngig, and when all was ready returned to inform her. He found that,\r\nthough still pale and unwell, she had in the meantime sent for the\r\nBudmouth man who brought the tidings, and learnt from him all there was\r\nto know.\r\n\r\nBeing hardly in a condition to drive home as she had driven to town,\r\nBoldwood, with every delicacy of manner and feeling, offered to get her\r\na driver, or to give her a seat in his phaeton, which was more\r\ncomfortable than her own conveyance. These proposals Bathsheba gently\r\ndeclined, and the farmer at once departed.\r\n\r\nAbout half-an-hour later she invigorated herself by an effort, and took\r\nher seat and the reins as usual\u2014in external appearance much as if\r\nnothing had happened. She went out of the town by a tortuous back\r\nstreet, and drove slowly along, unconscious of the road and the scene.\r\nThe first shades of evening were showing themselves when Bathsheba\r\nreached home, where, silently alighting and leaving the horse in the\r\nhands of the boy, she proceeded at once upstairs. Liddy met her on the\r\nlanding. The news had preceded Bathsheba to Weatherbury by\r\nhalf-an-hour, and Liddy looked inquiringly into her mistress\u2019s face.\r\nBathsheba had nothing to say.\r\n\r\nShe entered her bedroom and sat by the window, and thought and thought\r\ntill night enveloped her, and the extreme lines only of her shape were\r\nvisible. Somebody came to the door, knocked, and opened it.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, what is it, Liddy?\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CI was thinking there must be something got for you to wear,\u201D said\r\nLiddy, with hesitation.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMourning.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, no,\u201D said Bathsheba, hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I suppose there must be something done for poor\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot at present, I think. It is not necessary.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy not, ma\u2019am?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause he\u2019s still alive.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do you know that?\u201D said Liddy, amazed.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know it. But wouldn\u2019t it have been different, or shouldn\u2019t I\r\nhave heard more, or wouldn\u2019t they have found him, Liddy?\u2014or\u2014I don\u2019t\r\nknow how it is, but death would have been different from how this is. I\r\nam perfectly convinced that he is still alive!\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba remained firm in this opinion till Monday, when two\r\ncircumstances conjoined to shake it. The first was a short paragraph in\r\nthe local newspaper, which, beyond making by a methodizing pen\r\nformidable presumptive evidence of Troy\u2019s death by drowning, contained\r\nthe important testimony of a young Mr. Barker, M.D., of Budmouth, who\r\nspoke to being an eyewitness of the accident, in a letter to the\r\neditor. In this he stated that he was passing over the cliff on the\r\nremoter side of the cove just as the sun was setting. At that time he\r\nsaw a bather carried along in the current outside the mouth of the\r\ncove, and guessed in an instant that there was but a poor chance for\r\nhim unless he should be possessed of unusual muscular powers. He\r\ndrifted behind a projection of the coast, and Mr. Barker followed along\r\nthe shore in the same direction. But by the time that he could reach an\r\nelevation sufficiently great to command a view of the sea beyond, dusk\r\nhad set in, and nothing further was to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe other circumstance was the arrival of his clothes, when it became\r\nnecessary for her to examine and identify them\u2014though this had\r\nvirtually been done long before by those who inspected the letters in\r\nhis pockets. It was so evident to her in the midst of her agitation\r\nthat Troy had undressed in the full conviction of dressing again almost\r\nimmediately, that the notion that anything but death could have\r\nprevented him was a perverse one to entertain.\r\n\r\nThen Bathsheba said to herself that others were assured in their\r\nopinion; strange that she should not be. A strange reflection occurred\r\nto her, causing her face to flush. Suppose that Troy had followed Fanny\r\ninto another world. Had he done this intentionally, yet contrived to\r\nmake his death appear like an accident? Nevertheless, this thought of\r\nhow the apparent might differ from the real\u2014made vivid by her bygone\r\njealousy of Fanny, and the remorse he had shown that night\u2014did not\r\nblind her to the perception of a likelier difference, less tragic, but\r\nto herself far more disastrous.\r\n\r\nWhen alone late that evening beside a small fire, and much calmed down,\r\nBathsheba took Troy\u2019s watch into her hand, which had been restored to\r\nher with the rest of the articles belonging to him. She opened the case\r\nas he had opened it before her a week ago. There was the little coil of\r\npale hair which had been as the fuze to this great explosion.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe was hers and she was his; they should be gone together,\u201D she said.\r\n\u201CI am nothing to either of them, and why should I keep her hair?\u201D She\r\ntook it in her hand, and held it over the fire. \u201CNo\u2014I\u2019ll not burn\r\nit\u2014I\u2019ll keep it in memory of her, poor thing!\u201D she added, snatching\r\nback her hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\nOAK\u2019S ADVANCEMENT\u2014A GREAT HOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe later autumn and the winter drew on apace, and the leaves lay thick\r\nupon the turf of the glades and the mosses of the woods. Bathsheba,\r\nhaving previously been living in a state of suspended feeling which was\r\nnot suspense, now lived in a mood of quietude which was not precisely\r\npeacefulness. While she had known him to be alive she could have\r\nthought of his death with equanimity; but now that it might be she had\r\nlost him, she regretted that he was not hers still. She kept the farm\r\ngoing, raked in her profits without caring keenly about them, and\r\nexpended money on ventures because she had done so in bygone days,\r\nwhich, though not long gone by, seemed infinitely removed from her\r\npresent. She looked back upon that past over a great gulf, as if she\r\nwere now a dead person, having the faculty of meditation still left in\r\nher, by means of which, like the mouldering gentlefolk of the poet\u2019s\r\nstory, she could sit and ponder what a gift life used to be.\r\n\r\nHowever, one excellent result of her general apathy was the\r\nlong-delayed installation of Oak as bailiff; but he having virtually\r\nexercised that function for a long time already, the change, beyond the\r\nsubstantial increase of wages it brought, was little more than a\r\nnominal one addressed to the outside world.\r\n\r\nBoldwood lived secluded and inactive. Much of his wheat and all his\r\nbarley of that season had been spoilt by the rain. It sprouted, grew\r\ninto intricate mats, and was ultimately thrown to the pigs in armfuls.\r\nThe strange neglect which had produced this ruin and waste became the\r\nsubject of whispered talk among all the people round; and it was\r\nelicited from one of Boldwood\u2019s men that forgetfulness had nothing to\r\ndo with it, for he had been reminded of the danger to his corn as many\r\ntimes and as persistently as inferiors dared to do. The sight of the\r\npigs turning in disgust from the rotten ears seemed to arouse Boldwood,\r\nand he one evening sent for Oak. Whether it was suggested by\r\nBathsheba\u2019s recent act of promotion or not, the farmer proposed at the\r\ninterview that Gabriel should undertake the superintendence of the\r\nLower Farm as well as of Bathsheba\u2019s, because of the necessity Boldwood\r\nfelt for such aid, and the impossibility of discovering a more\r\ntrustworthy man. Gabriel\u2019s malignant star was assuredly setting fast.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, when she learnt of this proposal\u2014for Oak was obliged to\r\nconsult her\u2014at first languidly objected. She considered that the two\r\nfarms together were too extensive for the observation of one man.\r\nBoldwood, who was apparently determined by personal rather than\r\ncommercial reasons, suggested that Oak should be furnished with a horse\r\nfor his sole use, when the plan would present no difficulty, the two\r\nfarms lying side by side. Boldwood did not directly communicate with\r\nher during these negotiations, only speaking to Oak, who was the\r\ngo-between throughout. All was harmoniously arranged at last, and we\r\nnow see Oak mounted on a strong cob, and daily trotting the length and\r\nbreadth of about two thousand acres in a cheerful spirit of\r\nsurveillance, as if the crops all belonged to him\u2014the actual mistress\r\nof the one-half and the master of the other, sitting in their\r\nrespective homes in gloomy and sad seclusion.\r\n\r\nOut of this there arose, during the spring succeeding, a talk in the\r\nparish that Gabriel Oak was feathering his nest fast.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhatever d\u2019ye think,\u201D said Susan Tall, \u201CGable Oak is coming it quite\r\nthe dand. He now wears shining boots with hardly a hob in \u2019em, two or\r\nthree times a-week, and a tall hat a-Sundays, and \u2019a hardly knows the\r\nname of smockfrock. When I see people strut enough to be cut up into\r\nbantam cocks, I stand dormant with wonder, and says no more!\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was eventually known that Gabriel, though paid a fixed wage by\r\nBathsheba independent of the fluctuations of agricultural profits, had\r\nmade an engagement with Boldwood by which Oak was to receive a share of\r\nthe receipts\u2014a small share certainly, yet it was money of a higher\r\nquality than mere wages, and capable of expansion in a way that wages\r\nwere not. Some were beginning to consider Oak a \u201Cnear\u201D man, for though\r\nhis condition had thus far improved, he lived in no better style than\r\nbefore, occupying the same cottage, paring his own potatoes, mending\r\nhis stockings, and sometimes even making his bed with his own hands.\r\nBut as Oak was not only provokingly indifferent to public opinion, but\r\na man who clung persistently to old habits and usages, simply because\r\nthey were old, there was room for doubt as to his motives.\r\n\r\nA great hope had latterly germinated in Boldwood, whose unreasoning\r\ndevotion to Bathsheba could only be characterized as a fond madness\r\nwhich neither time nor circumstance, evil nor good report, could weaken\r\nor destroy. This fevered hope had grown up again like a grain of\r\nmustard-seed during the quiet which followed the hasty conjecture that\r\nTroy was drowned. He nourished it fearfully, and almost shunned the\r\ncontemplation of it in earnest, lest facts should reveal the wildness\r\nof the dream. Bathsheba having at last been persuaded to wear mourning,\r\nher appearance as she entered the church in that guise was in itself a\r\nweekly addition to his faith that a time was coming\u2014very far off\r\nperhaps, yet surely nearing\u2014when his waiting on events should have its\r\nreward. How long he might have to wait he had not yet closely\r\nconsidered. What he would try to recognize was that the severe\r\nschooling she had been subjected to had made Bathsheba much more\r\nconsiderate than she had formerly been of the feelings of others, and\r\nhe trusted that, should she be willing at any time in the future to\r\nmarry any man at all, that man would be himself. There was a substratum\r\nof good feeling in her: her self-reproach for the injury she had\r\nthoughtlessly done him might be depended upon now to a much greater\r\nextent than before her infatuation and disappointment. It would be\r\npossible to approach her by the channel of her good nature, and to\r\nsuggest a friendly businesslike compact between them for fulfilment at\r\nsome future day, keeping the passionate side of his desire entirely out\r\nof her sight. Such was Boldwood\u2019s hope.\r\n\r\nTo the eyes of the middle-aged, Bathsheba was perhaps additionally\r\ncharming just now. Her exuberance of spirit was pruned down; the\r\noriginal phantom of delight had shown herself to be not too bright for\r\nhuman nature\u2019s daily food, and she had been able to enter this second\r\npoetical phase without losing much of the first in the process.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\u2019s return from a two months\u2019 visit to her old aunt at Norcombe\r\nafforded the impassioned and yearning farmer a pretext for inquiring\r\ndirectly after her\u2014now possibly in the ninth month of her widowhood\u2014and\r\nendeavouring to get a notion of her state of mind regarding him. This\r\noccurred in the middle of the haymaking, and Boldwood contrived to be\r\nnear Liddy, who was assisting in the fields.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am glad to see you out of doors, Lydia,\u201D he said pleasantly.\r\n\r\nShe simpered, and wondered in her heart why he should speak so frankly\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\u201CI hope Mrs. Troy is quite well after her long absence,\u201D he continued,\r\nin a manner expressing that the coldest-hearted neighbour could\r\nscarcely say less about her.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe is quite well, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd cheerful, I suppose.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, cheerful.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFearful, did you say?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh no. I merely said she was cheerful.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTells you all her affairs?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSome of them?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMrs. Troy puts much confidence in you, Lydia, and very wisely,\r\nperhaps.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe do, sir. I\u2019ve been with her all through her troubles, and was with\r\nher at the time of Mr. Troy\u2019s going and all. And if she were to marry\r\nagain I expect I should bide with her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe promises that you shall\u2014quite natural,\u201D said the strategic lover,\r\nthrobbing throughout him at the presumption which Liddy\u2019s words\r\nappeared to warrant\u2014that his darling had thought of re-marriage.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo\u2014she doesn\u2019t promise it exactly. I merely judge on my own account.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, yes, I understand. When she alludes to the possibility of\r\nmarrying again, you conclude\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe never do allude to it, sir,\u201D said Liddy, thinking how very stupid\r\nMr. Boldwood was getting.\r\n\r\n\u201COf course not,\u201D he returned hastily, his hope falling again. \u201CYou\r\nneedn\u2019t take quite such long reaches with your rake, Lydia\u2014short and\r\nquick ones are best. Well, perhaps, as she is absolute mistress again\r\nnow, it is wise of her to resolve never to give up her freedom.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy mistress did certainly once say, though not seriously, that she\r\nsupposed she might marry again at the end of seven years from last\r\nyear, if she cared to risk Mr. Troy\u2019s coming back and claiming her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, six years from the present time. Said that she might. She might\r\nmarry at once in every reasonable person\u2019s opinion, whatever the\r\nlawyers may say to the contrary.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you been to ask them?\u201D said Liddy, innocently.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot I,\u201D said Boldwood, growing red. \u201CLiddy, you needn\u2019t stay here a\r\nminute later than you wish, so Mr. Oak says. I am now going on a little\r\nfarther. Good-afternoon.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe went away vexed with himself, and ashamed of having for this one\r\ntime in his life done anything which could be called underhand. Poor\r\nBoldwood had no more skill in finesse than a battering-ram, and he was\r\nuneasy with a sense of having made himself to appear stupid and, what\r\nwas worse, mean. But he had, after all, lighted upon one fact by way of\r\nrepayment. It was a singularly fresh and fascinating fact, and though\r\nnot without its sadness it was pertinent and real. In little more than\r\nsix years from this time Bathsheba might certainly marry him. There was\r\nsomething definite in that hope, for admitting that there might have\r\nbeen no deep thought in her words to Liddy about marriage, they showed\r\nat least her creed on the matter.\r\n\r\nThis pleasant notion was now continually in his mind. Six years were a\r\nlong time, but how much shorter than never, the idea he had for so long\r\nbeen obliged to endure! Jacob had served twice seven years for Rachel:\r\nwhat were six for such a woman as this? He tried to like the notion of\r\nwaiting for her better than that of winning her at once. Boldwood felt\r\nhis love to be so deep and strong and eternal, that it was possible she\r\nhad never yet known its full volume, and this patience in delay would\r\nafford him an opportunity of giving sweet proof on the point. He would\r\nannihilate the six years of his life as if they were minutes\u2014so little\r\ndid he value his time on earth beside her love. He would let her see,\r\nall those six years of intangible ethereal courtship, how little care\r\nhe had for anything but as it bore upon the consummation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the early and the late summer brought round the week in which\r\nGreenhill Fair was held. This fair was frequently attended by the folk\r\nof Weatherbury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\nTHE SHEEP FAIR\u2014TROY TOUCHES HIS WIFE\u2019S HAND\r\n\r\n\r\nGreenhill was the Nijni Novgorod of South Wessex; and the busiest,\r\nmerriest, noisiest day of the whole statute number was the day of the\r\nsheep fair. This yearly gathering was upon the summit of a hill which\r\nretained in good preservation the remains of an ancient earthwork,\r\nconsisting of a huge rampart and entrenchment of an oval form\r\nencircling the top of the hill, though somewhat broken down here and\r\nthere. To each of the two chief openings on opposite sides a winding\r\nroad ascended, and the level green space of ten or fifteen acres\r\nenclosed by the bank was the site of the fair. A few permanent\r\nerections dotted the spot, but the majority of visitors patronized\r\ncanvas alone for resting and feeding under during the time of their\r\nsojourn here.\r\n\r\nShepherds who attended with their flocks from long distances started\r\nfrom home two or three days, or even a week, before the fair, driving\r\ntheir charges a few miles each day\u2014not more than ten or twelve\u2014and\r\nresting them at night in hired fields by the wayside at previously\r\nchosen points, where they fed, having fasted since morning. The\r\nshepherd of each flock marched behind, a bundle containing his kit for\r\nthe week strapped upon his shoulders, and in his hand his crook, which\r\nhe used as the staff of his pilgrimage. Several of the sheep would get\r\nworn and lame, and occasionally a lambing occurred on the road. To meet\r\nthese contingencies, there was frequently provided, to accompany the\r\nflocks from the remoter points, a pony and waggon into which the weakly\r\nones were taken for the remainder of the journey.\r\n\r\nThe Weatherbury Farms, however, were no such long distance from the\r\nhill, and those arrangements were not necessary in their case. But the\r\nlarge united flocks of Bathsheba and Farmer Boldwood formed a valuable\r\nand imposing multitude which demanded much attention, and on this\r\naccount Gabriel, in addition to Boldwood\u2019s shepherd and Cain Ball,\r\naccompanied them along the way, through the decayed old town of\r\nKingsbere, and upward to the plateau,\u2014old George the dog of course\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nWhen the autumn sun slanted over Greenhill this morning and lighted the\r\ndewy flat upon its crest, nebulous clouds of dust were to be seen\r\nfloating between the pairs of hedges which streaked the wide prospect\r\naround in all directions. These gradually converged upon the base of\r\nthe hill, and the flocks became individually visible, climbing the\r\nserpentine ways which led to the top. Thus, in a slow procession, they\r\nentered the opening to which the roads tended, multitude after\r\nmultitude, horned and hornless\u2014blue flocks and red flocks, buff flocks\r\nand brown flocks, even green and salmon-tinted flocks, according to the\r\nfancy of the colourist and custom of the farm. Men were shouting, dogs\r\nwere barking, with greatest animation, but the thronging travellers in\r\nso long a journey had grown nearly indifferent to such terrors, though\r\nthey still bleated piteously at the unwontedness of their experiences,\r\na tall shepherd rising here and there in the midst of them, like a\r\ngigantic idol amid a crowd of prostrate devotees.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of sheep in the fair consisted of South Downs and the\r\nold Wessex horned breeds; to the latter class Bathsheba\u2019s and Farmer\r\nBoldwood\u2019s mainly belonged. These filed in about nine o\u2019clock, their\r\nvermiculated horns lopping gracefully on each side of their cheeks in\r\ngeometrically perfect spirals, a small pink and white ear nestling\r\nunder each horn. Before and behind came other varieties, perfect\r\nleopards as to the full rich substance of their coats, and only lacking\r\nthe spots. There were also a few of the Oxfordshire breed, whose wool\r\nwas beginning to curl like a child\u2019s flaxen hair, though surpassed in\r\nthis respect by the effeminate Leicesters, which were in turn less\r\ncurly than the Cotswolds. But the most picturesque by far was a small\r\nflock of Exmoors, which chanced to be there this year. Their pied faces\r\nand legs, dark and heavy horns, tresses of wool hanging round their\r\nswarthy foreheads, quite relieved the monotony of the flocks in that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nAll these bleating, panting, and weary thousands had entered and were\r\npenned before the morning had far advanced, the dog belonging to each\r\nflock being tied to the corner of the pen containing it. Alleys for\r\npedestrians intersected the pens, which soon became crowded with buyers\r\nand sellers from far and near.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the hill an altogether different scene began to\r\nforce itself upon the eye towards midday. A circular tent, of\r\nexceptional newness and size, was in course of erection here. As the\r\nday drew on, the flocks began to change hands, lightening the\r\nshepherd\u2019s responsibilities; and they turned their attention to this\r\ntent and inquired of a man at work there, whose soul seemed\r\nconcentrated on tying a bothering knot in no time, what was going on.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Royal Hippodrome Performance of Turpin\u2019s Ride to York and the\r\nDeath of Black Bess,\u201D replied the man promptly, without turning his\r\neyes or leaving off tying.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the tent was completed the band struck up highly stimulating\r\nharmonies, and the announcement was publicly made, Black Bess standing\r\nin a conspicuous position on the outside, as a living proof, if proof\r\nwere wanted, of the truth of the oracular utterances from the stage\r\nover which the people were to enter. These were so convinced by such\r\ngenuine appeals to heart and understanding both that they soon began to\r\ncrowd in abundantly, among the foremost being visible Jan Coggan and\r\nJoseph Poorgrass, who were holiday keeping here to-day.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s the great ruffen pushing me!\u201D screamed a woman in front of Jan\r\nover her shoulder at him when the rush was at its fiercest.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow can I help pushing ye when the folk behind push me?\u201D said Coggan,\r\nin a deprecating tone, turning his head towards the aforesaid folk as\r\nfar as he could without turning his body, which was jammed as in a\r\nvice.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence; then the drums and trumpets again sent forth their\r\nechoing notes. The crowd was again ecstasied, and gave another lurch in\r\nwhich Coggan and Poorgrass were again thrust by those behind upon the\r\nwomen in front.\r\n\r\n\u201COh that helpless feymels should be at the mercy of such ruffens!\u201D\r\nexclaimed one of these ladies again, as she swayed like a reed shaken\r\nby the wind.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow,\u201D said Coggan, appealing in an earnest voice to the public at\r\nlarge as it stood clustered about his shoulder-blades, \u201Cdid ye ever\r\nhear such onreasonable woman as that? Upon my carcase, neighbours, if I\r\ncould only get out of this cheese-wring, the damn women might eat the\r\nshow for me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t ye lose yer temper, Jan!\u201D implored Joseph Poorgrass, in a\r\nwhisper. \u201CThey might get their men to murder us, for I think by the\r\nshine of their eyes that they be a sinful form of womankind.\u201D\r\n\r\nJan held his tongue, as if he had no objection to be pacified to please\r\na friend, and they gradually reached the foot of the ladder, Poorgrass\r\nbeing flattened like a jumping-jack, and the sixpence, for admission,\r\nwhich he had got ready half-an-hour earlier, having become so reeking\r\nhot in the tight squeeze of his excited hand that the woman in\r\nspangles, brazen rings set with glass diamonds, and with chalked face\r\nand shoulders, who took the money of him, hastily dropped it again from\r\na fear that some trick had been played to burn her fingers. So they all\r\nentered, and the cloth of the tent, to the eyes of an observer on the\r\noutside, became bulged into innumerable pimples such as we observe on a\r\nsack of potatoes, caused by the various human heads, backs, and elbows\r\nat high pressure within.\r\n\r\nAt the rear of the large tent there were two small dressing-tents. One\r\nof these, alloted to the male performers, was partitioned into halves\r\nby a cloth; and in one of the divisions there was sitting on the grass,\r\npulling on a pair of jack-boots, a young man whom we instantly\r\nrecognise as Sergeant Troy.\r\n\r\nTroy\u2019s appearance in this position may be briefly accounted for. The\r\nbrig aboard which he was taken in Budmouth Roads was about to start on\r\na voyage, though somewhat short of hands. Troy read the articles and\r\njoined, but before they sailed a boat was despatched across the bay to\r\nLulwind cove; as he had half expected, his clothes were gone. He\r\nultimately worked his passage to the United States, where he made a\r\nprecarious living in various towns as Professor of Gymnastics, Sword\r\nExercise, Fencing, and Pugilism. A few months were sufficient to give\r\nhim a distaste for this kind of life. There was a certain animal form\r\nof refinement in his nature; and however pleasant a strange condition\r\nmight be whilst privations were easily warded off, it was\r\ndisadvantageously coarse when money was short. There was ever present,\r\ntoo, the idea that he could claim a home and its comforts did he but\r\nchose to return to England and Weatherbury Farm. Whether Bathsheba\r\nthought him dead was a frequent subject of curious conjecture. To\r\nEngland he did return at last; but the fact of drawing nearer to\r\nWeatherbury abstracted its fascinations, and his intention to enter his\r\nold groove at the place became modified. It was with gloom he\r\nconsidered on landing at Liverpool that if he were to go home his\r\nreception would be of a kind very unpleasant to contemplate; for what\r\nTroy had in the way of emotion was an occasional fitful sentiment which\r\nsometimes caused him as much inconvenience as emotion of a strong and\r\nhealthy kind. Bathsheba was not a woman to be made a fool of, or a\r\nwoman to suffer in silence; and how could he endure existence with a\r\nspirited wife to whom at first entering he would be beholden for food\r\nand lodging? Moreover, it was not at all unlikely that his wife would\r\nfail at her farming, if she had not already done so; and he would then\r\nbecome liable for her maintenance: and what a life such a future of\r\npoverty with her would be, the spectre of Fanny constantly between\r\nthem, harrowing his temper and embittering her words! Thus, for reasons\r\ntouching on distaste, regret, and shame commingled, he put off his\r\nreturn from day to day, and would have decided to put it off altogether\r\nif he could have found anywhere else the ready-made establishment which\r\nexisted for him there.\r\n\r\nAt this time\u2014the July preceding the September in which we find at\r\nGreenhill Fair\u2014he fell in with a travelling circus which was performing\r\nin the outskirts of a northern town. Troy introduced himself to the\r\nmanager by taming a restive horse of the troupe, hitting a suspended\r\napple with a pistol-bullet fired from the animal\u2019s back when in full\r\ngallop, and other feats. For his merits in these\u2014all more or less based\r\nupon his experiences as a dragoon-guardsman\u2014Troy was taken into the\r\ncompany, and the play of Turpin was prepared with a view to his\r\npersonation of the chief character. Troy was not greatly elated by the\r\nappreciative spirit in which he was undoubtedly treated, but he thought\r\nthe engagement might afford him a few weeks for consideration. It was\r\nthus carelessly, and without having formed any definite plan for the\r\nfuture, that Troy found himself at Greenhill Fair with the rest of the\r\ncompany on this day.\r\n\r\nAnd now the mild autumn sun got lower, and in front of the pavilion the\r\nfollowing incident had taken place. Bathsheba\u2014who was driven to the\r\nfair that day by her odd man Poorgrass\u2014had, like every one else, read\r\nor heard the announcement that Mr. Francis, the Great Cosmopolitan\r\nEquestrian and Roughrider, would enact the part of Turpin, and she was\r\nnot yet too old and careworn to be without a little curiosity to see\r\nhim. This particular show was by far the largest and grandest in the\r\nfair, a horde of little shows grouping themselves under its shade like\r\nchickens around a hen. The crowd had passed in, and Boldwood, who had\r\nbeen watching all the day for an opportunity of speaking to her, seeing\r\nher comparatively isolated, came up to her side.\r\n\r\n\u201CI hope the sheep have done well to-day, Mrs. Troy?\u201D he said,\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n\u201COh yes, thank you,\u201D said Bathsheba, colour springing up in the centre\r\nof her cheeks. \u201CI was fortunate enough to sell them all just as we got\r\nupon the hill, so we hadn\u2019t to pen at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd now you are entirely at leisure?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, except that I have to see one more dealer in two hours\u2019 time:\r\notherwise I should be going home. He was looking at this large tent and\r\nthe announcement. Have you ever seen the play of \u2018Turpin\u2019s Ride to\r\nYork\u2019? Turpin was a real man, was he not?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh yes, perfectly true\u2014all of it. Indeed, I think I\u2019ve heard Jan\r\nCoggan say that a relation of his knew Tom King, Turpin\u2019s friend, quite\r\nwell.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCoggan is rather given to strange stories connected with his\r\nrelations, we must remember. I hope they can all be believed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, yes; we know Coggan. But Turpin is true enough. You have never\r\nseen it played, I suppose?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever. I was not allowed to go into these places when I was young.\r\nHark! What\u2019s that prancing? How they shout!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBlack Bess just started off, I suppose. Am I right in supposing you\r\nwould like to see the performance, Mrs. Troy? Please excuse my mistake,\r\nif it is one; but if you would like to, I\u2019ll get a seat for you with\r\npleasure.\u201D Perceiving that she hesitated, he added, \u201CI myself shall not\r\nstay to see it: I\u2019ve seen it before.\u201D\r\n\r\nNow Bathsheba did care a little to see the show, and had only withheld\r\nher feet from the ladder because she feared to go in alone. She had\r\nbeen hoping that Oak might appear, whose assistance in such cases was\r\nalways accepted as an inalienable right, but Oak was nowhere to be\r\nseen; and hence it was that she said, \u201CThen if you will just look in\r\nfirst, to see if there\u2019s room, I think I will go in for a minute or\r\ntwo.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd so a short time after this Bathsheba appeared in the tent with\r\nBoldwood at her elbow, who, taking her to a \u201Creserved\u201D seat, again\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\nThis feature consisted of one raised bench in a very conspicuous part\r\nof the circle, covered with red cloth, and floored with a piece of\r\ncarpet, and Bathsheba immediately found, to her confusion, that she was\r\nthe single reserved individual in the tent, the rest of the crowded\r\nspectators, one and all, standing on their legs on the borders of the\r\narena, where they got twice as good a view of the performance for half\r\nthe money. Hence as many eyes were turned upon her, enthroned alone in\r\nthis place of honour, against a scarlet background, as upon the ponies\r\nand clown who were engaged in preliminary exploits in the centre,\r\nTurpin not having yet appeared. Once there, Bathsheba was forced to\r\nmake the best of it and remain: she sat down, spreading her skirts with\r\nsome dignity over the unoccupied space on each side of her, and giving\r\na new and feminine aspect to the pavilion. In a few minutes she noticed\r\nthe fat red nape of Coggan\u2019s neck among those standing just below her,\r\nand Joseph Poorgrass\u2019s saintly profile a little further on.\r\n\r\nThe interior was shadowy with a peculiar shade. The strange luminous\r\nsemi-opacities of fine autumn afternoons and eves intensified into\r\nRembrandt effects the few yellow sunbeams which came through holes and\r\ndivisions in the canvas, and spirted like jets of gold-dust across the\r\ndusky blue atmosphere of haze pervading the tent, until they alighted\r\non inner surfaces of cloth opposite, and shone like little lamps\r\nsuspended there.\r\n\r\nTroy, on peeping from his dressing-tent through a slit for a\r\nreconnoitre before entering, saw his unconscious wife on high before\r\nhim as described, sitting as queen of the tournament. He started back\r\nin utter confusion, for although his disguise effectually concealed his\r\npersonality, he instantly felt that she would be sure to recognize his\r\nvoice. He had several times during the day thought of the possibility\r\nof some Weatherbury person or other appearing and recognizing him; but\r\nhe had taken the risk carelessly. If they see me, let them, he had\r\nsaid. But here was Bathsheba in her own person; and the reality of the\r\nscene was so much intenser than any of his prefigurings that he felt he\r\nhad not half enough considered the point.\r\n\r\nShe looked so charming and fair that his cool mood about Weatherbury\r\npeople was changed. He had not expected her to exercise this power over\r\nhim in the twinkling of an eye. Should he go on, and care nothing? He\r\ncould not bring himself to do that. Beyond a politic wish to remain\r\nunknown, there suddenly arose in him now a sense of shame at the\r\npossibility that his attractive young wife, who already despised him,\r\nshould despise him more by discovering him in so mean a condition after\r\nso long a time. He actually blushed at the thought, and was vexed\r\nbeyond measure that his sentiments of dislike towards Weatherbury\r\nshould have led him to dally about the country in this way.\r\n\r\nBut Troy was never more clever than when absolutely at his wit\u2019s end.\r\nHe hastily thrust aside the curtain dividing his own little dressing\r\nspace from that of the manager and proprietor, who now appeared as the\r\nindividual called Tom King as far down as his waist, and as the\r\naforesaid respectable manager thence to his toes.\r\n\r\n\u201CHere\u2019s the devil to pay!\u201D said Troy.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow\u2019s that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, there\u2019s a blackguard creditor in the tent I don\u2019t want to see,\r\nwho\u2019ll discover me and nab me as sure as Satan if I open my mouth.\r\nWhat\u2019s to be done?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must appear now, I think.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut the play must proceed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you give out that Turpin has got a bad cold, and can\u2019t speak his\r\npart, but that he\u2019ll perform it just the same without speaking.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe proprietor shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnyhow, play or no play, I won\u2019t open my mouth,\u201D said Troy, firmly.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well, then let me see. I tell you how we\u2019ll manage,\u201D said the\r\nother, who perhaps felt it would be extremely awkward to offend his\r\nleading man just at this time. \u201CI won\u2019t tell \u2019em anything about your\r\nkeeping silence; go on with the piece and say nothing, doing what you\r\ncan by a judicious wink now and then, and a few indomitable nods in the\r\nheroic places, you know. They\u2019ll never find out that the speeches are\r\nomitted.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis seemed feasible enough, for Turpin\u2019s speeches were not many or\r\nlong, the fascination of the piece lying entirely in the action; and\r\naccordingly the play began, and at the appointed time Black Bess leapt\r\ninto the grassy circle amid the plaudits of the spectators. At the\r\nturnpike scene, where Bess and Turpin are hotly pursued at midnight by\r\nthe officers, and the half-awake gatekeeper in his tasselled nightcap\r\ndenies that any horseman has passed, Coggan uttered a broad-chested\r\n\u201CWell done!\u201D which could be heard all over the fair above the bleating,\r\nand Poorgrass smiled delightedly with a nice sense of dramatic contrast\r\nbetween our hero, who coolly leaps the gate, and halting justice in the\r\nform of his enemies, who must needs pull up cumbersomely and wait to be\r\nlet through. At the death of Tom King, he could not refrain from\r\nseizing Coggan by the hand, and whispering, with tears in his eyes, \u201COf\r\ncourse he\u2019s not really shot, Jan\u2014only seemingly!\u201D And when the last sad\r\nscene came on, and the body of the gallant and faithful Bess had to be\r\ncarried out on a shutter by twelve volunteers from among the\r\nspectators, nothing could restrain Poorgrass from lending a hand,\r\nexclaiming, as he asked Jan to join him, \u201C\u2019Twill be something to tell\r\nof at Warren\u2019s in future years, Jan, and hand down to our children.\u201D\r\nFor many a year in Weatherbury, Joseph told, with the air of a man who\r\nhad had experiences in his time, that he touched with his own hand the\r\nhoof of Bess as she lay upon the board upon his shoulder. If, as some\r\nthinkers hold, immortality consists in being enshrined in others\u2019\r\nmemories, then did Black Bess become immortal that day if she never had\r\ndone so before.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Troy had added a few touches to his ordinary make-up for the\r\ncharacter, the more effectually to disguise himself, and though he had\r\nfelt faint qualms on first entering, the metamorphosis effected by\r\njudiciously \u201Clining\u201D his face with a wire rendered him safe from the\r\neyes of Bathsheba and her men. Nevertheless, he was relieved when it\r\nwas got through.\r\n\r\nThere was a second performance in the evening, and the tent was lighted\r\nup. Troy had taken his part very quietly this time, venturing to\r\nintroduce a few speeches on occasion; and was just concluding it when,\r\nwhilst standing at the edge of the circle contiguous to the first row\r\nof spectators, he observed within a yard of him the eye of a man darted\r\nkeenly into his side features. Troy hastily shifted his position, after\r\nhaving recognized in the scrutineer the knavish bailiff Pennyways, his\r\nwife\u2019s sworn enemy, who still hung about the outskirts of Weatherbury.\r\n\r\nAt first Troy resolved to take no notice and abide by circumstances.\r\nThat he had been recognized by this man was highly probable; yet there\r\nwas room for a doubt. Then the great objection he had felt to allowing\r\nnews of his proximity to precede him to Weatherbury in the event of his\r\nreturn, based on a feeling that knowledge of his present occupation\r\nwould discredit him still further in his wife\u2019s eyes, returned in full\r\nforce. Moreover, should he resolve not to return at all, a tale of his\r\nbeing alive and being in the neighbourhood would be awkward; and he was\r\nanxious to acquire a knowledge of his wife\u2019s temporal affairs before\r\ndeciding which to do.\r\n\r\nIn this dilemma Troy at once went out to reconnoitre. It occurred to\r\nhim that to find Pennyways, and make a friend of him if possible, would\r\nbe a very wise act. He had put on a thick beard borrowed from the\r\nestablishment, and in this he wandered about the fair-field. It was now\r\nalmost dark, and respectable people were getting their carts and gigs\r\nready to go home.\r\n\r\nThe largest refreshment booth in the fair was provided by an innkeeper\r\nfrom a neighbouring town. This was considered an unexceptionable place\r\nfor obtaining the necessary food and rest: Host Trencher (as he was\r\njauntily called by the local newspaper) being a substantial man of high\r\nrepute for catering through all the country round. The tent was divided\r\ninto first and second-class compartments, and at the end of the\r\nfirst-class division was a yet further enclosure for the most\r\nexclusive, fenced off from the body of the tent by a luncheon-bar,\r\nbehind which the host himself stood bustling about in white apron and\r\nshirt-sleeves, and looking as if he had never lived anywhere but under\r\ncanvas all his life. In these penetralia were chairs and a table,\r\nwhich, on candles being lighted, made quite a cozy and luxurious show,\r\nwith an urn, plated tea and coffee pots, china teacups, and plum cakes.\r\n\r\nTroy stood at the entrance to the booth, where a gipsy-woman was frying\r\npancakes over a little fire of sticks and selling them at a penny\r\na-piece, and looked over the heads of the people within. He could see\r\nnothing of Pennyways, but he soon discerned Bathsheba through an\r\nopening into the reserved space at the further end. Troy thereupon\r\nretreated, went round the tent into the darkness, and listened. He\r\ncould hear Bathsheba\u2019s voice immediately inside the canvas; she was\r\nconversing with a man. A warmth overspread his face: surely she was not\r\nso unprincipled as to flirt in a fair! He wondered if, then, she\r\nreckoned upon his death as an absolute certainty. To get at the root of\r\nthe matter, Troy took a penknife from his pocket and softly made two\r\nlittle cuts crosswise in the cloth, which, by folding back the corners\r\nleft a hole the size of a wafer. Close to this he placed his face,\r\nwithdrawing it again in a movement of surprise; for his eye had been\r\nwithin twelve inches of the top of Bathsheba\u2019s head. It was too near to\r\nbe convenient. He made another hole a little to one side and lower\r\ndown, in a shaded place beside her chair, from which it was easy and\r\nsafe to survey her by looking horizontally.\r\n\r\nTroy took in the scene completely now. She was leaning back, sipping a\r\ncup of tea that she held in her hand, and the owner of the male voice\r\nwas Boldwood, who had apparently just brought the cup to her,\r\nBathsheba, being in a negligent mood, leant so idly against the canvas\r\nthat it was pressed to the shape of her shoulder, and she was, in fact,\r\nas good as in Troy\u2019s arms; and he was obliged to keep his breast\r\ncarefully backward that she might not feel its warmth through the cloth\r\nas he gazed in.\r\n\r\nTroy found unexpected chords of feeling to be stirred again within him\r\nas they had been stirred earlier in the day. She was handsome as ever,\r\nand she was his. It was some minutes before he could counteract his\r\nsudden wish to go in, and claim her. Then he thought how the proud girl\r\nwho had always looked down upon him even whilst it was to love him,\r\nwould hate him on discovering him to be a strolling player. Were he to\r\nmake himself known, that chapter of his life must at all risks be kept\r\nfor ever from her and from the Weatherbury people, or his name would be\r\na byword throughout the parish. He would be nicknamed \u201CTurpin\u201D as long\r\nas he lived. Assuredly before he could claim her these few past months\r\nof his existence must be entirely blotted out.\r\n\r\n\u201CShall I get you another cup before you start, ma\u2019am?\u201D said Farmer\r\nBoldwood.\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you,\u201D said Bathsheba. \u201CBut I must be going at once. It was great\r\nneglect in that man to keep me waiting here till so late. I should have\r\ngone two hours ago, if it had not been for him. I had no idea of coming\r\nin here; but there\u2019s nothing so refreshing as a cup of tea, though I\r\nshould never have got one if you hadn\u2019t helped me.\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy scrutinized her cheek as lit by the candles, and watched each\r\nvarying shade thereon, and the white shell-like sinuosities of her\r\nlittle ear. She took out her purse and was insisting to Boldwood on\r\npaying for her tea for herself, when at this moment Pennyways entered\r\nthe tent. Troy trembled: here was his scheme for respectability\r\nendangered at once. He was about to leave his hole of espial, attempt\r\nto follow Pennyways, and find out if the ex-bailiff had recognized him,\r\nwhen he was arrested by the conversation, and found he was too late.\r\n\r\n\u201CExcuse me, ma\u2019am,\u201D said Pennyways; \u201CI\u2019ve some private information for\r\nyour ear alone.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot hear it now,\u201D she said, coldly. That Bathsheba could not\r\nendure this man was evident; in fact, he was continually coming to her\r\nwith some tale or other, by which he might creep into favour at the\r\nexpense of persons maligned.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll write it down,\u201D said Pennyways, confidently. He stooped over the\r\ntable, pulled a leaf from a warped pocket-book, and wrote upon the\r\npaper, in a round hand\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201C_Your husband is here. I\u2019ve seen him. Who\u2019s the fool now?_\u201D\r\n\r\nThis he folded small, and handed towards her. Bathsheba would not read\r\nit; she would not even put out her hand to take it. Pennyways, then,\r\nwith a laugh of derision, tossed it into her lap, and, turning away,\r\nleft her.\r\n\r\nFrom the words and action of Pennyways, Troy, though he had not been\r\nable to see what the ex-bailiff wrote, had not a moment\u2019s doubt that\r\nthe note referred to him. Nothing that he could think of could be done\r\nto check the exposure. \u201CCurse my luck!\u201D he whispered, and added\r\nimprecations which rustled in the gloom like a pestilent wind.\r\nMeanwhile Boldwood said, taking up the note from her lap\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t you wish to read it, Mrs. Troy? If not, I\u2019ll destroy it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, well,\u201D said Bathsheba, carelessly, \u201Cperhaps it is unjust not to\r\nread it; but I can guess what it is about. He wants me to recommend\r\nhim, or it is to tell me of some little scandal or another connected\r\nwith my work-people. He\u2019s always doing that.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba held the note in her right hand. Boldwood handed towards her\r\na plate of cut bread-and-butter; when, in order to take a slice, she\r\nput the note into her left hand, where she was still holding the purse,\r\nand then allowed her hand to drop beside her close to the canvas. The\r\nmoment had come for saving his game, and Troy impulsively felt that he\r\nwould play the card. For yet another time he looked at the fair hand,\r\nand saw the pink finger-tips, and the blue veins of the wrist,\r\nencircled by a bracelet of coral chippings which she wore: how familiar\r\nit all was to him! Then, with the lightning action in which he was such\r\nan adept, he noiselessly slipped his hand under the bottom of the\r\ntent-cloth, which was far from being pinned tightly down, lifted it a\r\nlittle way, keeping his eye to the hole, snatched the note from her\r\nfingers, dropped the canvas, and ran away in the gloom towards the bank\r\nand ditch, smiling at the scream of astonishment which burst from her.\r\nTroy then slid down on the outside of the rampart, hastened round in\r\nthe bottom of the entrenchment to a distance of a hundred yards,\r\nascended again, and crossed boldly in a slow walk towards the front\r\nentrance of the tent. His object was now to get to Pennyways, and\r\nprevent a repetition of the announcement until such time as he should\r\nchoose.\r\n\r\nTroy reached the tent door, and standing among the groups there\r\ngathered, looked anxiously for Pennyways, evidently not wishing to make\r\nhimself prominent by inquiring for him. One or two men were speaking of\r\na daring attempt that had just been made to rob a young lady by lifting\r\nthe canvas of the tent beside her. It was supposed that the rogue had\r\nimagined a slip of paper which she held in her hand to be a bank note,\r\nfor he had seized it, and made off with it, leaving her purse behind.\r\nHis chagrin and disappointment at discovering its worthlessness would\r\nbe a good joke, it was said. However, the occurrence seemed to have\r\nbecome known to few, for it had not interrupted a fiddler, who had\r\nlately begun playing by the door of the tent, nor the four bowed old\r\nmen with grim countenances and walking-sticks in hand, who were dancing\r\n\u201CMajor Malley\u2019s Reel\u201D to the tune. Behind these stood Pennyways. Troy\r\nglided up to him, beckoned, and whispered a few words; and with a\r\nmutual glance of concurrence the two men went into the night together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\nBATHSHEBA TALKS WITH HER OUTRIDER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrangement for getting back again to Weatherbury had been that Oak\r\nshould take the place of Poorgrass in Bathsheba\u2019s conveyance and drive\r\nher home, it being discovered late in the afternoon that Joseph was\r\nsuffering from his old complaint, a multiplying eye, and was,\r\ntherefore, hardly trustworthy as coachman and protector to a woman. But\r\nOak had found himself so occupied, and was full of so many cares\r\nrelative to those portions of Boldwood\u2019s flocks that were not disposed\r\nof, that Bathsheba, without telling Oak or anybody, resolved to drive\r\nhome herself, as she had many times done from Casterbridge Market, and\r\ntrust to her good angel for performing the journey unmolested. But\r\nhaving fallen in with Farmer Boldwood accidentally (on her part at\r\nleast) at the refreshment-tent, she found it impossible to refuse his\r\noffer to ride on horseback beside her as escort. It had grown twilight\r\nbefore she was aware, but Boldwood assured her that there was no cause\r\nfor uneasiness, as the moon would be up in half-an-hour.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the incident in the tent, she had risen to go\u2014now\r\nabsolutely alarmed and really grateful for her old lover\u2019s\r\nprotection\u2014though regretting Gabriel\u2019s absence, whose company she would\r\nhave much preferred, as being more proper as well as more pleasant,\r\nsince he was her own managing-man and servant. This, however, could not\r\nbe helped; she would not, on any consideration, treat Boldwood harshly,\r\nhaving once already ill-used him, and the moon having risen, and the\r\ngig being ready, she drove across the hilltop in the wending way\u2019s\r\nwhich led downwards\u2014to oblivious obscurity, as it seemed, for the moon\r\nand the hill it flooded with light were in appearance on a level, the\r\nrest of the world lying as a vast shady concave between them. Boldwood\r\nmounted his horse, and followed in close attendance behind. Thus they\r\ndescended into the lowlands, and the sounds of those left on the hill\r\ncame like voices from the sky, and the lights were as those of a camp\r\nin heaven. They soon passed the merry stragglers in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the hill, traversed Kingsbere, and got upon the high road.\r\n\r\nThe keen instincts of Bathsheba had perceived that the farmer\u2019s staunch\r\ndevotion to herself was still undiminished, and she sympathized deeply.\r\nThe sight had quite depressed her this evening; had reminded her of her\r\nfolly; she wished anew, as she had wished many months ago, for some\r\nmeans of making reparation for her fault. Hence her pity for the man\r\nwho so persistently loved on to his own injury and permanent gloom had\r\nbetrayed Bathsheba into an injudicious considerateness of manner, which\r\nappeared almost like tenderness, and gave new vigour to the exquisite\r\ndream of a Jacob\u2019s seven years service in poor Boldwood\u2019s mind.\r\n\r\nHe soon found an excuse for advancing from his position in the rear,\r\nand rode close by her side. They had gone two or three miles in the\r\nmoonlight, speaking desultorily across the wheel of her gig concerning\r\nthe fair, farming, Oak\u2019s usefulness to them both, and other indifferent\r\nsubjects, when Boldwood said suddenly and simply\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CMrs. Troy, you will marry again some day?\u201D\r\n\r\nThis point-blank query unmistakably confused her, and it was not till a\r\nminute or more had elapsed that she said, \u201CI have not seriously thought\r\nof any such subject.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI quite understand that. Yet your late husband has been dead nearly\r\none year, and\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou forget that his death was never absolutely proved, and may not\r\nhave taken place; so that I may not be really a widow,\u201D she said,\r\ncatching at the straw of escape that the fact afforded.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot absolutely proved, perhaps, but it was proved circumstantially. A\r\nman saw him drowning, too. No reasonable person has any doubt of his\r\ndeath; nor have you, ma\u2019am, I should imagine.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have none now, or I should have acted differently,\u201D she said,\r\ngently. \u201CI certainly, at first, had a strange unaccountable feeling\r\nthat he could not have perished, but I have been able to explain that\r\nin several ways since. But though I am fully persuaded that I shall see\r\nhim no more, I am far from thinking of marriage with another. I should\r\nbe very contemptible to indulge in such a thought.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey were silent now awhile, and having struck into an unfrequented\r\ntrack across a common, the creaks of Boldwood\u2019s saddle and her gig\r\nsprings were all the sounds to be heard. Boldwood ended the pause.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you remember when I carried you fainting in my arms into the King\u2019s\r\nArms, in Casterbridge? Every dog has his day: that was mine.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI know\u2014I know it all,\u201D she said, hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\u201CI, for one, shall never cease regretting that events so fell out as to\r\ndeny you to me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI, too, am very sorry,\u201D she said, and then checked herself. \u201CI mean,\r\nyou know, I am sorry you thought I\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have always this dreary pleasure in thinking over those past times\r\nwith you\u2014that I was something to you before _he_ was anything, and that\r\nyou belonged _almost_ to me. But, of course, that\u2019s nothing. You never\r\nliked me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI did; and respected you, too.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you now?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhich?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do you mean which?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you like me, or do you respect me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know\u2014at least, I cannot tell you. It is difficult for a woman\r\nto define her feelings in language which is chiefly made by men to\r\nexpress theirs. My treatment of you was thoughtless, inexcusable,\r\nwicked! I shall eternally regret it. If there had been anything I could\r\nhave done to make amends I would most gladly have done it\u2014there was\r\nnothing on earth I so longed to do as to repair the error. But that was\r\nnot possible.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t blame yourself\u2014you were not so far in the wrong as you suppose.\r\nBathsheba, suppose you had real complete proof that you are what, in\r\nfact, you are\u2014a widow\u2014would you repair the old wrong to me by marrying\r\nme?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot say. I shouldn\u2019t yet, at any rate.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you might at some future time of your life?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh yes, I might at some time.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, then, do you know that without further proof of any kind you may\r\nmarry again in about six years from the present\u2014subject to nobody\u2019s\r\nobjection or blame?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh yes,\u201D she said, quickly. \u201CI know all that. But don\u2019t talk of\r\nit\u2014seven or six years\u2014where may we all be by that time?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey will soon glide by, and it will seem an astonishingly short time\r\nto look back upon when they are past\u2014much less than to look forward to\r\nnow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, yes; I have found that in my own experience.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow listen once more,\u201D Boldwood pleaded. \u201CIf I wait that time, will\r\nyou marry me? You own that you owe me amends\u2014let that be your way of\r\nmaking them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut, Mr. Boldwood\u2014six years\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you want to be the wife of any other man?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo indeed! I mean, that I don\u2019t like to talk about this matter now.\r\nPerhaps it is not proper, and I ought not to allow it. Let us drop it.\r\nMy husband may be living, as I said.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf course, I\u2019ll drop the subject if you wish. But propriety has\r\nnothing to do with reasons. I am a middle-aged man, willing to protect\r\nyou for the remainder of our lives. On your side, at least, there is no\r\npassion or blamable haste\u2014on mine, perhaps, there is. But I can\u2019t help\r\nseeing that if you choose from a feeling of pity, and, as you say, a\r\nwish to make amends, to make a bargain with me for a far-ahead time\u2014an\r\nagreement which will set all things right and make me happy, late\r\nthough it may be\u2014there is no fault to be found with you as a woman.\r\nHadn\u2019t I the first place beside you? Haven\u2019t you been almost mine once\r\nalready? Surely you can say to me as much as this, you will have me\r\nback again should circumstances permit? Now, pray speak! O Bathsheba,\r\npromise\u2014it is only a little promise\u2014that if you marry again, you will\r\nmarry me!\u201D\r\n\r\nHis tone was so excited that she almost feared him at this moment, even\r\nwhilst she sympathized. It was a simple physical fear\u2014the weak of the\r\nstrong; there was no emotional aversion or inner repugnance. She said,\r\nwith some distress in her voice, for she remembered vividly his\r\noutburst on the Yalbury Road, and shrank from a repetition of his\r\nanger:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CI will never marry another man whilst you wish me to be your wife,\r\nwhatever comes\u2014but to say more\u2014you have taken me so by surprise\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut let it stand in these simple words\u2014that in six years\u2019 time you\r\nwill be my wife? Unexpected accidents we\u2019ll not mention, because those,\r\nof course, must be given way to. Now, this time I know you will keep\r\nyour word.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s why I hesitate to give it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut do give it! Remember the past, and be kind.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe breathed; and then said mournfully: \u201COh what shall I do? I don\u2019t\r\nlove you, and I much fear that I never shall love you as much as a\r\nwoman ought to love a husband. If you, sir, know that, and I can yet\r\ngive you happiness by a mere promise to marry at the end of six years,\r\nif my husband should not come back, it is a great honour to me. And if\r\nyou value such an act of friendship from a woman who doesn\u2019t esteem\r\nherself as she did, and has little love left, why I\u2014I will\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPromise!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014Consider, if I cannot promise soon.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut soon is perhaps never?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh no, it is not! I mean soon. Christmas, we\u2019ll say.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CChristmas!\u201D He said nothing further till he added: \u201CWell, I\u2019ll say no\r\nmore to you about it till that time.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba was in a very peculiar state of mind, which showed how\r\nentirely the soul is the slave of the body, the ethereal spirit\r\ndependent for its quality upon the tangible flesh and blood. It is\r\nhardly too much to say that she felt coerced by a force stronger than\r\nher own will, not only into the act of promising upon this singularly\r\nremote and vague matter, but into the emotion of fancying that she\r\nought to promise. When the weeks intervening between the night of this\r\nconversation and Christmas day began perceptibly to diminish, her\r\nanxiety and perplexity increased.\r\n\r\nOne day she was led by an accident into an oddly confidential dialogue\r\nwith Gabriel about her difficulty. It afforded her a little relief\u2014of a\r\ndull and cheerless kind. They were auditing accounts, and something\r\noccurred in the course of their labours which led Oak to say, speaking\r\nof Boldwood, \u201CHe\u2019ll never forget you, ma\u2019am, never.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen out came her trouble before she was aware; and she told him how\r\nshe had again got into the toils; what Boldwood had asked her, and how\r\nhe was expecting her assent. \u201CThe most mournful reason of all for my\r\nagreeing to it,\u201D she said sadly, \u201Cand the true reason why I think to do\r\nso for good or for evil, is this\u2014it is a thing I have not breathed to a\r\nliving soul as yet\u2014I believe that if I don\u2019t give my word, he\u2019ll go out\r\nof his mind.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, do ye?\u201D said Gabriel, gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201CI believe this,\u201D she continued, with reckless frankness; \u201Cand Heaven\r\nknows I say it in a spirit the very reverse of vain, for I am grieved\r\nand troubled to my soul about it\u2014I believe I hold that man\u2019s future in\r\nmy hand. His career depends entirely upon my treatment of him. O\r\nGabriel, I tremble at my responsibility, for it is terrible!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I think this much, ma\u2019am, as I told you years ago,\u201D said Oak,\r\n\u201Cthat his life is a total blank whenever he isn\u2019t hoping for \u2019ee; but I\r\ncan\u2019t suppose\u2014I hope that nothing so dreadful hangs on to it as you\r\nfancy. His natural manner has always been dark and strange, you know.\r\nBut since the case is so sad and odd-like, why don\u2019t ye give the\r\nconditional promise? I think I would.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut is it right? Some rash acts of my past life have taught me that a\r\nwatched woman must have very much circumspection to retain only a very\r\nlittle credit, and I do want and long to be discreet in this! And six\r\nyears\u2014why we may all be in our graves by that time, even if Mr. Troy\r\ndoes not come back again, which he may not impossibly do! Such thoughts\r\ngive a sort of absurdity to the scheme. Now, isn\u2019t it preposterous,\r\nGabriel? However he came to dream of it, I cannot think. But is it\r\nwrong? You know\u2014you are older than I.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEight years older, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, eight years\u2014and is it wrong?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps it would be an uncommon agreement for a man and woman to make:\r\nI don\u2019t see anything really wrong about it,\u201D said Oak, slowly. \u201CIn fact\r\nthe very thing that makes it doubtful if you ought to marry en under\r\nany condition, that is, your not caring about him\u2014for I may suppose\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, you may suppose that love is wanting,\u201D she said shortly. \u201CLove is\r\nan utterly bygone, sorry, worn-out, miserable thing with me\u2014for him or\r\nany one else.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, your want of love seems to me the one thing that takes away harm\r\nfrom such an agreement with him. If wild heat had to do wi\u2019 it, making\r\nye long to over-come the awkwardness about your husband\u2019s vanishing, it\r\nmid be wrong; but a cold-hearted agreement to oblige a man seems\r\ndifferent, somehow. The real sin, ma\u2019am in my mind, lies in thinking of\r\never wedding wi\u2019 a man you don\u2019t love honest and true.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat I\u2019m willing to pay the penalty of,\u201D said Bathsheba, firmly. \u201CYou\r\nknow, Gabriel, this is what I cannot get off my conscience\u2014that I once\r\nseriously injured him in sheer idleness. If I had never played a trick\r\nupon him, he would never have wanted to marry me. Oh if I could only\r\npay some heavy damages in money to him for the harm I did, and so get\r\nthe sin off my soul that way!... Well, there\u2019s the debt, which can only\r\nbe discharged in one way, and I believe I am bound to do it if it\r\nhonestly lies in my power, without any consideration of my own future\r\nat all. When a rake gambles away his expectations, the fact that it is\r\nan inconvenient debt doesn\u2019t make him the less liable. I\u2019ve been a\r\nrake, and the single point I ask you is, considering that my own\r\nscruples, and the fact that in the eye of the law my husband is only\r\nmissing, will keep any man from marrying me until seven years have\r\npassed\u2014am I free to entertain such an idea, even though \u2019tis a sort of\r\npenance\u2014for it will be that? I _hate_ the act of marriage under such\r\ncircumstances, and the class of women I should seem to belong to by\r\ndoing it!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt seems to me that all depends upon whe\u2019r you think, as everybody\r\nelse do, that your husband is dead.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014I\u2019ve long ceased to doubt that. I well know what would have\r\nbrought him back long before this time if he had lived.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, then, in a religious sense you will be as free to _think_ o\u2019\r\nmarrying again as any real widow of one year\u2019s standing. But why don\u2019t\r\nye ask Mr. Thirdly\u2019s advice on how to treat Mr. Boldwood?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo. When I want a broad-minded opinion for general enlightenment,\r\ndistinct from special advice, I never go to a man who deals in the\r\nsubject professionally. So I like the parson\u2019s opinion on law, the\r\nlawyer\u2019s on doctoring, the doctor\u2019s on business, and my\r\nbusiness-man\u2019s\u2014that is, yours\u2014on morals.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd on love\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy own.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s a hitch in that argument,\u201D said Oak, with a grave\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nShe did not reply at once, and then saying, \u201CGood evening, Mr. Oak,\u201D\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nShe had spoken frankly, and neither asked nor expected any reply from\r\nGabriel more satisfactory than that she had obtained. Yet in the\r\ncentremost parts of her complicated heart there existed at this minute\r\na little pang of disappointment, for a reason she would not allow\r\nherself to recognize. Oak had not once wished her free that he might\r\nmarry her himself\u2014had not once said, \u201CI could wait for you as well as\r\nhe.\u201D That was the insect sting. Not that she would have listened to any\r\nsuch hypothesis. O no\u2014for wasn\u2019t she saying all the time that such\r\nthoughts of the future were improper, and wasn\u2019t Gabriel far too poor a\r\nman to speak sentiment to her? Yet he might have just hinted about that\r\nold love of his, and asked, in a playful off-hand way, if he might\r\nspeak of it. It would have seemed pretty and sweet, if no more; and\r\nthen she would have shown how kind and inoffensive a woman\u2019s \u201CNo\u201D can\r\nsometimes be. But to give such cool advice\u2014the very advice she had\r\nasked for\u2014it ruffled our heroine all the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\nCONVERGING COURSES\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nChristmas-eve came, and a party that Boldwood was to give in the\r\nevening was the great subject of talk in Weatherbury. It was not that\r\nthe rarity of Christmas parties in the parish made this one a wonder,\r\nbut that Boldwood should be the giver. The announcement had had an\r\nabnormal and incongruous sound, as if one should hear of\r\ncroquet-playing in a cathedral aisle, or that some much-respected judge\r\nwas going upon the stage. That the party was intended to be a truly\r\njovial one there was no room for doubt. A large bough of mistletoe had\r\nbeen brought from the woods that day, and suspended in the hall of the\r\nbachelor\u2019s home. Holly and ivy had followed in armfuls. From six that\r\nmorning till past noon the huge wood fire in the kitchen roared and\r\nsparkled at its highest, the kettle, the saucepan, and the three-legged\r\npot appearing in the midst of the flames like Shadrach, Meshach, and\r\nAbednego; moreover, roasting and basting operations were continually\r\ncarried on in front of the genial blaze.\r\n\r\nAs it grew later the fire was made up in the large long hall into which\r\nthe staircase descended, and all encumbrances were cleared out for\r\ndancing. The log which was to form the back-brand of the evening fire\r\nwas the uncleft trunk of a tree, so unwieldy that it could be neither\r\nbrought nor rolled to its place; and accordingly two men were to be\r\nobserved dragging and heaving it in by chains and levers as the hour of\r\nassembly drew near.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, the spirit of revelry was wanting in the\r\natmosphere of the house. Such a thing had never been attempted before\r\nby its owner, and it was now done as by a wrench. Intended gaieties\r\nwould insist upon appearing like solemn grandeurs, the organization of\r\nthe whole effort was carried out coldly, by hirelings, and a shadow\r\nseemed to move about the rooms, saying that the proceedings were\r\nunnatural to the place and the lone man who lived therein, and hence\r\nnot good.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nBathsheba was at this time in her room, dressing for the event. She had\r\ncalled for candles, and Liddy entered and placed one on each side of\r\nher mistress\u2019s glass.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t go away, Liddy,\u201D said Bathsheba, almost timidly. \u201CI am foolishly\r\nagitated\u2014I cannot tell why. I wish I had not been obliged to go to this\r\ndance; but there\u2019s no escaping now. I have not spoken to Mr. Boldwood\r\nsince the autumn, when I promised to see him at Christmas on business,\r\nbut I had no idea there was to be anything of this kind.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I would go now,\u201D said Liddy, who was going with her; for Boldwood\r\nhad been indiscriminate in his invitations.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I shall make my appearance, of course,\u201D said Bathsheba. \u201CBut I am\r\n_the cause_ of the party, and that upsets me!\u2014Don\u2019t tell, Liddy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh no, ma\u2019am. You the cause of it, ma\u2019am?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. I am the reason of the party\u2014I. If it had not been for me, there\r\nwould never have been one. I can\u2019t explain any more\u2014there\u2019s no more to\r\nbe explained. I wish I had never seen Weatherbury.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s wicked of you\u2014to wish to be worse off than you are.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, Liddy. I have never been free from trouble since I have lived\r\nhere, and this party is likely to bring me more. Now, fetch my black\r\nsilk dress, and see how it sits upon me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you will leave off that, surely, ma\u2019am? You have been a widow-lady\r\nfourteen months, and ought to brighten up a little on such a night as\r\nthis.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs it necessary? No; I will appear as usual, for if I were to wear any\r\nlight dress people would say things about me, and I should seem to be\r\nrejoicing when I am solemn all the time. The party doesn\u2019t suit me a\r\nbit; but never mind, stay and help to finish me off.\u201D\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBoldwood was dressing also at this hour. A tailor from Casterbridge was\r\nwith him, assisting him in the operation of trying on a new coat that\r\nhad just been brought home.\r\n\r\nNever had Boldwood been so fastidious, unreasonable about the fit, and\r\ngenerally difficult to please. The tailor walked round and round him,\r\ntugged at the waist, pulled the sleeve, pressed out the collar, and for\r\nthe first time in his experience Boldwood was not bored. Times had been\r\nwhen the farmer had exclaimed against all such niceties as childish,\r\nbut now no philosophic or hasty rebuke whatever was provoked by this\r\nman for attaching as much importance to a crease in the coat as to an\r\nearthquake in South America. Boldwood at last expressed himself nearly\r\nsatisfied, and paid the bill, the tailor passing out of the door just\r\nas Oak came in to report progress for the day.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Oak,\u201D said Boldwood. \u201CI shall of course see you here to-night.\r\nMake yourself merry. I am determined that neither expense nor trouble\r\nshall be spared.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll try to be here, sir, though perhaps it may not be very early,\u201D\r\nsaid Gabriel, quietly. \u201CI am glad indeed to see such a change in \u2019ee\r\nfrom what it used to be.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014I must own it\u2014I am bright to-night: cheerful and more than\r\ncheerful\u2014so much so that I am almost sad again with the sense that all\r\nof it is passing away. And sometimes, when I am excessively hopeful and\r\nblithe, a trouble is looming in the distance: so that I often get to\r\nlook upon gloom in me with content, and to fear a happy mood. Still\r\nthis may be absurd\u2014I feel that it is absurd. Perhaps my day is dawning\r\nat last.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI hope it \u2019ill be a long and a fair one.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you\u2014thank you. Yet perhaps my cheerfulness rests on a slender\r\nhope. And yet I trust my hope. It is faith, not hope. I think this time\r\nI reckon with my host.\u2014Oak, my hands are a little shaky, or something;\r\nI can\u2019t tie this neckerchief properly. Perhaps you will tie it for me.\r\nThe fact is, I have not been well lately, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am sorry to hear that, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, it\u2019s nothing. I want it done as well as you can, please. Is there\r\nany late knot in fashion, Oak?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know, sir,\u201D said Oak. His tone had sunk to sadness.\r\n\r\nBoldwood approached Gabriel, and as Oak tied the neckerchief the farmer\r\nwent on feverishly\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CDoes a woman keep her promise, Gabriel?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf it is not inconvenient to her she may.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014Or rather an implied promise.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t answer for her implying,\u201D said Oak, with faint bitterness.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a word as full o\u2019 holes as a sieve with them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COak, don\u2019t talk like that. You have got quite cynical lately\u2014how is\r\nit? We seem to have shifted our positions: I have become the young and\r\nhopeful man, and you the old and unbelieving one. However, does a woman\r\nkeep a promise, not to marry, but to enter on an engagement to marry at\r\nsome time? Now you know women better than I\u2014tell me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am afeard you honour my understanding too much. However, she may\r\nkeep such a promise, if it is made with an honest meaning to repair a\r\nwrong.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt has not gone far yet, but I think it will soon\u2014yes, I know it\r\nwill,\u201D he said, in an impulsive whisper. \u201CI have pressed her upon the\r\nsubject, and she inclines to be kind to me, and to think of me as a\r\nhusband at a long future time, and that\u2019s enough for me. How can I\r\nexpect more? She has a notion that a woman should not marry within\r\nseven years of her husband\u2019s disappearance\u2014that her own self shouldn\u2019t,\r\nI mean\u2014because his body was not found. It may be merely this legal\r\nreason which influences her, or it may be a religious one, but she is\r\nreluctant to talk on the point. Yet she has promised\u2014implied\u2014that she\r\nwill ratify an engagement to-night.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSeven years,\u201D murmured Oak.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no\u2014it\u2019s no such thing!\u201D he said, with impatience. \u201CFive years,\r\nnine months, and a few days. Fifteen months nearly have passed since he\r\nvanished, and is there anything so wonderful in an engagement of little\r\nmore than five years?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt seems long in a forward view. Don\u2019t build too much upon such\r\npromises, sir. Remember, you have once be\u2019n deceived. Her meaning may\r\nbe good; but there\u2014she\u2019s young yet.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDeceived? Never!\u201D said Boldwood, vehemently. \u201CShe never promised me at\r\nthat first time, and hence she did not break her promise! If she\r\npromises me, she\u2019ll marry me. Bathsheba is a woman to her word.\u201D\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTroy was sitting in a corner of The White Hart tavern at Casterbridge,\r\nsmoking and drinking a steaming mixture from a glass. A knock was given\r\nat the door, and Pennyways entered.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, have you seen him?\u201D Troy inquired, pointing to a chair.\r\n\r\n\u201CBoldwood?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo\u2014Lawyer Long.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe wadn\u2019 at home. I went there first, too.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a nuisance.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis rather, I suppose.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYet I don\u2019t see that, because a man appears to be drowned and was not,\r\nhe should be liable for anything. I shan\u2019t ask any lawyer\u2014not I.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut that\u2019s not it, exactly. If a man changes his name and so forth,\r\nand takes steps to deceive the world and his own wife, he\u2019s a cheat,\r\nand that in the eye of the law is ayless a rogue, and that is ayless a\r\nlammocken vagabond; and that\u2019s a punishable situation.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHa-ha! Well done, Pennyways,\u201D Troy had laughed, but it was with some\r\nanxiety that he said, \u201CNow, what I want to know is this, do you think\r\nthere\u2019s really anything going on between her and Boldwood? Upon my\r\nsoul, I should never have believed it! How she must detest me! Have you\r\nfound out whether she has encouraged him?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI haen\u2019t been able to learn. There\u2019s a deal of feeling on his side\r\nseemingly, but I don\u2019t answer for her. I didn\u2019t know a word about any\r\nsuch thing till yesterday, and all I heard then was that she was gwine\r\nto the party at his house to-night. This is the first time she has ever\r\ngone there, they say. And they say that she\u2019ve not so much as spoke to\r\nhim since they were at Greenhill Fair: but what can folk believe o\u2019t?\r\nHowever, she\u2019s not fond of him\u2014quite offish and quite careless, I\r\nknow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not so sure of that.... She\u2019s a handsome woman, Pennyways, is she\r\nnot? Own that you never saw a finer or more splendid creature in your\r\nlife. Upon my honour, when I set eyes upon her that day I wondered what\r\nI could have been made of to be able to leave her by herself so long.\r\nAnd then I was hampered with that bothering show, which I\u2019m free of at\r\nlast, thank the stars.\u201D He smoked on awhile, and then added, \u201CHow did\r\nshe look when you passed by yesterday?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, she took no great heed of me, ye may well fancy; but she looked\r\nwell enough, far\u2019s I know. Just flashed her haughty eyes upon my poor\r\nscram body, and then let them go past me to what was yond, much as if\r\nI\u2019d been no more than a leafless tree. She had just got off her mare to\r\nlook at the last wring-down of cider for the year; she had been riding,\r\nand so her colours were up and her breath rather quick, so that her\r\nbosom plimmed and fell\u2014plimmed and fell\u2014every time plain to my eye. Ay,\r\nand there were the fellers round her wringing down the cheese and\r\nbustling about and saying, \u2018Ware o\u2019 the pommy, ma\u2019am: \u2019twill spoil yer\r\ngown.\u2019 \u2018Never mind me,\u2019 says she. Then Gabe brought her some of the new\r\ncider, and she must needs go drinking it through a strawmote, and not\r\nin a nateral way at all. \u2018Liddy,\u2019 says she, \u2018bring indoors a few\r\ngallons, and I\u2019ll make some cider-wine.\u2019 Sergeant, I was no more to her\r\nthan a morsel of scroff in the fuel-house!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI must go and find her out at once\u2014O yes, I see that\u2014I must go. Oak is\r\nhead man still, isn\u2019t he?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, \u2019a b\u2019lieve. And at Little Weatherbury Farm too. He manages\r\neverything.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Twill puzzle him to manage her, or any other man of his compass!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know about that. She can\u2019t do without him, and knowing it well\r\nhe\u2019s pretty independent. And she\u2019ve a few soft corners to her mind,\r\nthough I\u2019ve never been able to get into one, the devil\u2019s in\u2019t!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, baily, she\u2019s a notch above you, and you must own it: a higher\r\nclass of animal\u2014a finer tissue. However, stick to me, and neither this\r\nhaughty goddess, dashing piece of womanhood, Juno-wife of mine (Juno\r\nwas a goddess, you know), nor anybody else shall hurt you. But all this\r\nwants looking into, I perceive. What with one thing and another, I see\r\nthat my work is well cut out for me.\u201D\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do I look to-night, Liddy?\u201D said Bathsheba, giving a final\r\nadjustment to her dress before leaving the glass.\r\n\r\n\u201CI never saw you look so well before. Yes\u2014I\u2019ll tell you when you looked\r\nlike it\u2014that night, a year and a half ago, when you came in so\r\nwildlike, and scolded us for making remarks about you and Mr. Troy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEverybody will think that I am setting myself to captivate Mr.\r\nBoldwood, I suppose,\u201D she murmured. \u201CAt least they\u2019ll say so. Can\u2019t my\r\nhair be brushed down a little flatter? I dread going\u2014yet I dread the\r\nrisk of wounding him by staying away.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnyhow, ma\u2019am, you can\u2019t well be dressed plainer than you are, unless\r\nyou go in sackcloth at once. \u2019Tis your excitement is what makes you\r\nlook so noticeable to-night.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what\u2019s the matter, I feel wretched at one time, and\r\nbuoyant at another. I wish I could have continued quite alone as I have\r\nbeen for the last year or so, with no hopes and no fears, and no\r\npleasure and no grief.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow just suppose Mr. Boldwood should ask you\u2014only just suppose it\u2014to\r\nrun away with him, what would you do, ma\u2019am?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLiddy\u2014none of that,\u201D said Bathsheba, gravely. \u201CMind, I won\u2019t hear\r\njoking on any such matter. Do you hear?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI beg pardon, ma\u2019am. But knowing what rum things we women be, I just\r\nsaid\u2014however, I won\u2019t speak of it again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo marrying for me yet for many a year; if ever, \u2019twill be for reasons\r\nvery, very different from those you think, or others will believe! Now\r\nget my cloak, for it is time to go.\u201D\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\u201COak,\u201D said Boldwood, \u201Cbefore you go I want to mention what has been\r\npassing in my mind lately\u2014that little arrangement we made about your\r\nshare in the farm I mean. That share is small, too small, considering\r\nhow little I attend to business now, and how much time and thought you\r\ngive to it. Well, since the world is brightening for me, I want to show\r\nmy sense of it by increasing your proportion in the partnership. I\u2019ll\r\nmake a memorandum of the arrangement which struck me as likely to be\r\nconvenient, for I haven\u2019t time to talk about it now; and then we\u2019ll\r\ndiscuss it at our leisure. My intention is ultimately to retire from\r\nthe management altogether, and until you can take all the expenditure\r\nupon your shoulders, I\u2019ll be a sleeping partner in the stock. Then, if\r\nI marry her\u2014and I hope\u2014I feel I shall, why\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPray don\u2019t speak of it, sir,\u201D said Oak, hastily. \u201CWe don\u2019t know what\r\nmay happen. So many upsets may befall \u2019ee. There\u2019s many a slip, as they\r\nsay\u2014and I would advise you\u2014I know you\u2019ll pardon me this once\u2014not to be\r\n_too sure_.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI know, I know. But the feeling I have about increasing your share is\r\non account of what I know of you. Oak, I have learnt a little about\r\nyour secret: your interest in her is more than that of bailiff for an\r\nemployer. But you have behaved like a man, and I, as a sort of\r\nsuccessful rival\u2014successful partly through your goodness of\r\nheart\u2014should like definitely to show my sense of your friendship under\r\nwhat must have been a great pain to you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CO that\u2019s not necessary, thank \u2019ee,\u201D said Oak, hurriedly. \u201CI must get\r\nused to such as that; other men have, and so shall I.\u201D\r\n\r\nOak then left him. He was uneasy on Boldwood\u2019s account, for he saw anew\r\nthat this constant passion of the farmer made him not the man he once\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nAs Boldwood continued awhile in his room alone\u2014ready and dressed to\r\nreceive his company\u2014the mood of anxiety about his appearance seemed to\r\npass away, and to be succeeded by a deep solemnity. He looked out of\r\nthe window, and regarded the dim outline of the trees upon the sky, and\r\nthe twilight deepening to darkness.\r\n\r\nThen he went to a locked closet, and took from a locked drawer therein\r\na small circular case the size of a pillbox, and was about to put it\r\ninto his pocket. But he lingered to open the cover and take a momentary\r\nglance inside. It contained a woman\u2019s finger-ring, set all the way\r\nround with small diamonds, and from its appearance had evidently been\r\nrecently purchased. Boldwood\u2019s eyes dwelt upon its many sparkles a long\r\ntime, though that its material aspect concerned him little was plain\r\nfrom his manner and mien, which were those of a mind following out the\r\npresumed thread of that jewel\u2019s future history.\r\n\r\nThe noise of wheels at the front of the house became audible. Boldwood\r\nclosed the box, stowed it away carefully in his pocket, and went out\r\nupon the landing. The old man who was his indoor factotum came at the\r\nsame moment to the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey be coming, sir\u2014lots of \u2019em\u2014a-foot and a-driving!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI was coming down this moment. Those wheels I heard\u2014is it Mrs. Troy?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, sir\u2014\u2019tis not she yet.\u201D\r\n\r\nA reserved and sombre expression had returned to Boldwood\u2019s face again,\r\nbut it poorly cloaked his feelings when he pronounced Bathsheba\u2019s name;\r\nand his feverish anxiety continued to show its existence by a galloping\r\nmotion of his fingers upon the side of his thigh as he went down the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\u201CHow does this cover me?\u201D said Troy to Pennyways. \u201CNobody would\r\nrecognize me now, I\u2019m sure.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe was buttoning on a heavy grey overcoat of Noachian cut, with cape\r\nand high collar, the latter being erect and rigid, like a girdling\r\nwall, and nearly reaching to the verge of a travelling cap which was\r\npulled down over his ears.\r\n\r\nPennyways snuffed the candle, and then looked up and deliberately\r\ninspected Troy.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve made up your mind to go then?\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CMade up my mind? Yes; of course I have.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy not write to her? \u2019Tis a very queer corner that you have got into,\r\nsergeant. You see all these things will come to light if you go back,\r\nand they won\u2019t sound well at all. Faith, if I was you I\u2019d even bide as\r\nyou be\u2014a single man of the name of Francis. A good wife is good, but\r\nthe best wife is not so good as no wife at all. Now that\u2019s my outspoke\r\nmind, and I\u2019ve been called a long-headed feller here and there.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAll nonsense!\u201D said Troy, angrily. \u201CThere she is with plenty of money,\r\nand a house and farm, and horses, and comfort, and here am I living\r\nfrom hand to mouth\u2014a needy adventurer. Besides, it is no use talking\r\nnow; it is too late, and I am glad of it; I\u2019ve been seen and recognized\r\nhere this very afternoon. I should have gone back to her the day after\r\nthe fair, if it hadn\u2019t been for you talking about the law, and rubbish\r\nabout getting a separation; and I don\u2019t put it off any longer. What the\r\ndeuce put it into my head to run away at all, I can\u2019t think! Humbugging\r\nsentiment\u2014that\u2019s what it was. But what man on earth was to know that\r\nhis wife would be in such a hurry to get rid of his name!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI should have known it. She\u2019s bad enough for anything.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPennyways, mind who you are talking to.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, sergeant, all I say is this, that if I were you I\u2019d go abroad\r\nagain where I came from\u2014\u2019tisn\u2019t too late to do it now. I wouldn\u2019t stir\r\nup the business and get a bad name for the sake of living with her\u2014for\r\nall that about your play-acting is sure to come out, you know, although\r\nyou think otherwise. My eyes and limbs, there\u2019ll be a racket if you go\r\nback just now\u2014in the middle of Boldwood\u2019s Christmasing!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CH\u2019m, yes. I expect I shall not be a very welcome guest if he has her\r\nthere,\u201D said the sergeant, with a slight laugh. \u201CA sort of Alonzo the\r\nBrave; and when I go in the guests will sit in silence and fear, and\r\nall laughter and pleasure will be hushed, and the lights in the chamber\r\nburn blue, and the worms\u2014Ugh, horrible!\u2014Ring for some more brandy,\r\nPennyways, I felt an awful shudder just then! Well, what is there\r\nbesides? A stick\u2014I must have a walking-stick.\u201D\r\n\r\nPennyways now felt himself to be in something of a difficulty, for\r\nshould Bathsheba and Troy become reconciled it would be necessary to\r\nregain her good opinion if he would secure the patronage of her\r\nhusband. \u201CI sometimes think she likes you yet, and is a good woman at\r\nbottom,\u201D he said, as a saving sentence. \u201CBut there\u2019s no telling to a\r\ncertainty from a body\u2019s outside. Well, you\u2019ll do as you like about\r\ngoing, of course, sergeant, and as for me, I\u2019ll do as you tell me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, let me see what the time is,\u201D said Troy, after emptying his glass\r\nin one draught as he stood. \u201CHalf-past six o\u2019clock. I shall not hurry\r\nalong the road, and shall be there then before nine.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\nCONCURRITUR\u2014HOR\u00C6 MOMENTO\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside the front of Boldwood\u2019s house a group of men stood in the dark,\r\nwith their faces towards the door, which occasionally opened and closed\r\nfor the passage of some guest or servant, when a golden rod of light\r\nwould stripe the ground for the moment and vanish again, leaving\r\nnothing outside but the glowworm shine of the pale lamp amid the\r\nevergreens over the door.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe was seen in Casterbridge this afternoon\u2014so the boy said,\u201D one of\r\nthem remarked in a whisper. \u201CAnd I for one believe it. His body was\r\nnever found, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis a strange story,\u201D said the next. \u201CYou may depend upon\u2019t that she\r\nknows nothing about it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot a word.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps he don\u2019t mean that she shall,\u201D said another man.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf he\u2019s alive and here in the neighbourhood, he means mischief,\u201D said\r\nthe first. \u201CPoor young thing: I do pity her, if \u2019tis true. He\u2019ll drag\r\nher to the dogs.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CO no; he\u2019ll settle down quiet enough,\u201D said one disposed to take a\r\nmore hopeful view of the case.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a fool she must have been ever to have had anything to do with\r\nthe man! She is so self-willed and independent too, that one is more\r\nminded to say it serves her right than pity her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no. I don\u2019t hold with \u2019ee there. She was no otherwise than a girl\r\nmind, and how could she tell what the man was made of? If \u2019tis really\r\ntrue, \u2019tis too hard a punishment, and more than she ought to\r\nhae.\u2014Hullo, who\u2019s that?\u201D This was to some footsteps that were heard\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\n\u201CWilliam Smallbury,\u201D said a dim figure in the shades, coming up and\r\njoining them. \u201CDark as a hedge, to-night, isn\u2019t it? I all but missed\r\nthe plank over the river ath\u2019art there in the bottom\u2014never did such a\r\nthing before in my life. Be ye any of Boldwood\u2019s workfolk?\u201D He peered\r\ninto their faces.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014all o\u2019 us. We met here a few minutes ago.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, I hear now\u2014that\u2019s Sam Samway: thought I knowed the voice, too.\r\nGoing in?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPresently. But I say, William,\u201D Samway whispered, \u201Chave ye heard this\r\nstrange tale?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2014that about Sergeant Troy being seen, d\u2019ye mean, souls?\u201D said\r\nSmallbury, also lowering his voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy: in Casterbridge.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I have. Laban Tall named a hint of it to me but now\u2014but I don\u2019t\r\nthink it. Hark, here Laban comes himself, \u2019a b\u2019lieve.\u201D A footstep drew\r\nnear.\r\n\r\n\u201CLaban?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, \u2019tis I,\u201D said Tall.\r\n\r\n\u201CHave ye heard any more about that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Tall, joining the group. \u201CAnd I\u2019m inclined to think we\u2019d\r\nbetter keep quiet. If so be \u2019tis not true, \u2019twill flurry her, and do\r\nher much harm to repeat it; and if so be \u2019tis true, \u2019twill do no good\r\nto forestall her time o\u2019 trouble. God send that it mid be a lie, for\r\nthough Henery Fray and some of \u2019em do speak against her, she\u2019s never\r\nbeen anything but fair to me. She\u2019s hot and hasty, but she\u2019s a brave\r\ngirl who\u2019ll never tell a lie however much the truth may harm her, and\r\nI\u2019ve no cause to wish her evil.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe never do tell women\u2019s little lies, that\u2019s true; and \u2019tis a thing\r\nthat can be said of very few. Ay, all the harm she thinks she says to\r\nyer face: there\u2019s nothing underhand wi\u2019 her.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey stood silent then, every man busied with his own thoughts, during\r\nwhich interval sounds of merriment could be heard within. Then the\r\nfront door again opened, the rays streamed out, the well-known form of\r\nBoldwood was seen in the rectangular area of light, the door closed,\r\nand Boldwood walked slowly down the path.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis master,\u201D one of the men whispered, as he neared them. \u201CWe\u2019d\r\nbetter stand quiet\u2014he\u2019ll go in again directly. He would think it\r\nunseemly o\u2019 us to be loitering here.\u201D\r\n\r\nBoldwood came on, and passed by the men without seeing them, they being\r\nunder the bushes on the grass. He paused, leant over the gate, and\r\nbreathed a long breath. They heard low words come from him.\r\n\r\n\u201CI hope to God she\u2019ll come, or this night will be nothing but misery to\r\nme! Oh my darling, my darling, why do you keep me in suspense like\r\nthis?\u201D\r\n\r\nHe said this to himself, and they all distinctly heard it. Boldwood\r\nremained silent after that, and the noise from indoors was again just\r\naudible, until, a few minutes later, light wheels could be\r\ndistinguished coming down the hill. They drew nearer, and ceased at the\r\ngate. Boldwood hastened back to the door, and opened it; and the light\r\nshone upon Bathsheba coming up the path.\r\n\r\nBoldwood compressed his emotion to mere welcome: the men marked her\r\nlight laugh and apology as she met him: he took her into the house; and\r\nthe door closed again.\r\n\r\n\u201CGracious heaven, I didn\u2019t know it was like that with him!\u201D said one of\r\nthe men. \u201CI thought that fancy of his was over long ago.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t know much of master, if you thought that,\u201D said Samway.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t he should know we heard what \u2019a said for the world,\u201D\r\nremarked a third.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish we had told of the report at once,\u201D the first uneasily\r\ncontinued. \u201CMore harm may come of this than we know of. Poor Mr.\r\nBoldwood, it will be hard upon en. I wish Troy was in\u2014Well, God forgive\r\nme for such a wish! A scoundrel to play a poor wife such tricks.\r\nNothing has prospered in Weatherbury since he came here. And now I\u2019ve\r\nno heart to go in. Let\u2019s look into Warren\u2019s for a few minutes first,\r\nshall us, neighbours?\u201D\r\n\r\nSamway, Tall, and Smallbury agreed to go to Warren\u2019s, and went out at\r\nthe gate, the remaining ones entering the house. The three soon drew\r\nnear the malt-house, approaching it from the adjoining orchard, and not\r\nby way of the street. The pane of glass was illuminated as usual.\r\nSmallbury was a little in advance of the rest when, pausing, he turned\r\nsuddenly to his companions and said, \u201CHist! See there.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe light from the pane was now perceived to be shining not upon the\r\nivied wall as usual, but upon some object close to the glass. It was a\r\nhuman face.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet\u2019s come closer,\u201D whispered Samway; and they approached on tiptoe.\r\nThere was no disbelieving the report any longer. Troy\u2019s face was almost\r\nclose to the pane, and he was looking in. Not only was he looking in,\r\nbut he appeared to have been arrested by a conversation which was in\r\nprogress in the malt-house, the voices of the interlocutors being those\r\nof Oak and the maltster.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe spree is all in her honour, isn\u2019t it\u2014hey?\u201D said the old man.\r\n\u201CAlthough he made believe \u2019tis only keeping up o\u2019 Christmas?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot say,\u201D replied Oak.\r\n\r\n\u201COh \u2019tis true enough, faith. I cannot understand Farmer Boldwood being\r\nsuch a fool at his time of life as to ho and hanker after this woman in\r\nthe way \u2019a do, and she not care a bit about en.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe men, after recognizing Troy\u2019s features, withdrew across the orchard\r\nas quietly as they had come. The air was big with Bathsheba\u2019s fortunes\r\nto-night: every word everywhere concerned her. When they were quite out\r\nof earshot all by one instinct paused.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt gave me quite a turn\u2014his face,\u201D said Tall, breathing.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd so it did me,\u201D said Samway. \u201CWhat\u2019s to be done?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t see that \u2019tis any business of ours,\u201D Smallbury murmured\r\ndubiously.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut it is! \u2019Tis a thing which is everybody\u2019s business,\u201D said Samway.\r\n\u201CWe know very well that master\u2019s on a wrong tack, and that she\u2019s quite\r\nin the dark, and we should let \u2019em know at once. Laban, you know her\r\nbest\u2014you\u2019d better go and ask to speak to her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI bain\u2019t fit for any such thing,\u201D said Laban, nervously. \u201CI should\r\nthink William ought to do it if anybody. He\u2019s oldest.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI shall have nothing to do with it,\u201D said Smallbury. \u201C\u2019Tis a ticklish\r\nbusiness altogether. Why, he\u2019ll go on to her himself in a few minutes,\r\nye\u2019ll see.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe don\u2019t know that he will. Come, Laban.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well, if I must I must, I suppose,\u201D Tall reluctantly answered.\r\n\u201CWhat must I say?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CJust ask to see master.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh no; I shan\u2019t speak to Mr. Boldwood. If I tell anybody, \u2019twill be\r\nmistress.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D said Samway.\r\n\r\nLaban then went to the door. When he opened it the hum of bustle rolled\r\nout as a wave upon a still strand\u2014the assemblage being immediately\r\ninside the hall\u2014and was deadened to a murmur as he closed it again.\r\nEach man waited intently, and looked around at the dark tree tops\r\ngently rocking against the sky and occasionally shivering in a slight\r\nwind, as if he took interest in the scene, which neither did. One of\r\nthem began walking up and down, and then came to where he started from\r\nand stopped again, with a sense that walking was a thing not worth\r\ndoing now.\r\n\r\n\u201CI should think Laban must have seen mistress by this time,\u201D said\r\nSmallbury, breaking the silence. \u201CPerhaps she won\u2019t come and speak to\r\nhim.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe door opened. Tall appeared, and joined them.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell?\u201D said both.\r\n\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t like to ask for her after all,\u201D Laban faltered out. \u201CThey\r\nwere all in such a stir, trying to put a little spirit into the party.\r\nSomehow the fun seems to hang fire, though everything\u2019s there that a\r\nheart can desire, and I couldn\u2019t for my soul interfere and throw damp\r\nupon it\u2014if \u2019twas to save my life, I couldn\u2019t!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI suppose we had better all go in together,\u201D said Samway, gloomily.\r\n\u201CPerhaps I may have a chance of saying a word to master.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the men entered the hall, which was the room selected and arranged\r\nfor the gathering because of its size. The younger men and maids were\r\nat last just beginning to dance. Bathsheba had been perplexed how to\r\nact, for she was not much more than a slim young maid herself, and the\r\nweight of stateliness sat heavy upon her. Sometimes she thought she\r\nought not to have come under any circumstances; then she considered\r\nwhat cold unkindness that would have been, and finally resolved upon\r\nthe middle course of staying for about an hour only, and gliding off\r\nunobserved, having from the first made up her mind that she could on no\r\naccount dance, sing, or take any active part in the proceedings.\r\n\r\nHer allotted hour having been passed in chatting and looking on,\r\nBathsheba told Liddy not to hurry herself, and went to the small\r\nparlour to prepare for departure, which, like the hall, was decorated\r\nwith holly and ivy, and well lighted up.\r\n\r\nNobody was in the room, but she had hardly been there a moment when the\r\nmaster of the house entered.\r\n\r\n\u201CMrs. Troy\u2014you are not going?\u201D he said. \u201CWe\u2019ve hardly begun!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I should like to go now.\u201D Her manner was restive,\r\nfor she remembered her promise, and imagined what he was about to say.\r\n\u201CBut as it is not late,\u201D she added, \u201CI can walk home, and leave my man\r\nand Liddy to come when they choose.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve been trying to get an opportunity of speaking to you,\u201D said\r\nBoldwood. \u201CYou know perhaps what I long to say?\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba silently looked on the floor.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou do give it?\u201D he said, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D she whispered.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, that\u2019s evasion! Why, the promise. I don\u2019t want to intrude upon\r\nyou at all, or to let it become known to anybody. But do give your\r\nword! A mere business compact, you know, between two people who are\r\nbeyond the influence of passion.\u201D Boldwood knew how false this picture\r\nwas as regarded himself; but he had proved that it was the only tone in\r\nwhich she would allow him to approach her. \u201CA promise to marry me at\r\nthe end of five years and three-quarters. You owe it to me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI feel that I do,\u201D said Bathsheba; \u201Cthat is, if you demand it. But I\r\nam a changed woman\u2014an unhappy woman\u2014and not\u2014not\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are still a very beautiful woman,\u201D said Boldwood. Honesty and pure\r\nconviction suggested the remark, unaccompanied by any perception that\r\nit might have been adopted by blunt flattery to soothe and win her.\r\n\r\nHowever, it had not much effect now, for she said, in a passionless\r\nmurmur which was in itself a proof of her words: \u201CI have no feeling in\r\nthe matter at all. And I don\u2019t at all know what is right to do in my\r\ndifficult position, and I have nobody to advise me. But I give my\r\npromise, if I must. I give it as the rendering of a debt,\r\nconditionally, of course, on my being a widow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll marry me between five and six years hence?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t press me too hard. I\u2019ll marry nobody else.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut surely you will name the time, or there\u2019s nothing in the promise\r\nat all?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, I don\u2019t know, pray let me go!\u201D she said, her bosom beginning to\r\nrise. \u201CI am afraid what to do! I want to be just to you, and to be that\r\nseems to be wronging myself, and perhaps it is breaking the\r\ncommandments. There is considerable doubt of his death, and then it is\r\ndreadful; let me ask a solicitor, Mr. Boldwood, if I ought or no!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSay the words, dear one, and the subject shall be dismissed; a\r\nblissful loving intimacy of six years, and then marriage\u2014O Bathsheba,\r\nsay them!\u201D he begged in a husky voice, unable to sustain the forms of\r\nmere friendship any longer. \u201CPromise yourself to me; I deserve it,\r\nindeed I do, for I have loved you more than anybody in the world! And\r\nif I said hasty words and showed uncalled-for heat of manner towards\r\nyou, believe me, dear, I did not mean to distress you; I was in agony,\r\nBathsheba, and I did not know what I said. You wouldn\u2019t let a dog\r\nsuffer what I have suffered, could you but know it! Sometimes I shrink\r\nfrom your knowing what I have felt for you, and sometimes I am\r\ndistressed that all of it you never will know. Be gracious, and give up\r\na little to me, when I would give up my life for you!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe trimmings of her dress, as they quivered against the light, showed\r\nhow agitated she was, and at last she burst out crying. \u201CAnd you\u2019ll\r\nnot\u2014press me\u2014about anything more\u2014if I say in five or six years?\u201D she\r\nsobbed, when she had power to frame the words.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, then I\u2019ll leave it to time.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe waited a moment. \u201CVery well. I\u2019ll marry you in six years from this\r\nday, if we both live,\u201D she said solemnly.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you\u2019ll take this as a token from me.\u201D\r\n\r\nBoldwood had come close to her side, and now he clasped one of her\r\nhands in both his own, and lifted it to his breast.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is it? Oh I cannot wear a ring!\u201D she exclaimed, on seeing what he\r\nheld; \u201Cbesides, I wouldn\u2019t have a soul know that it\u2019s an engagement!\r\nPerhaps it is improper? Besides, we are not engaged in the usual sense,\r\nare we? Don\u2019t insist, Mr. Boldwood\u2014don\u2019t!\u201D In her trouble at not being\r\nable to get her hand away from him at once, she stamped passionately on\r\nthe floor with one foot, and tears crowded to her eyes again.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt means simply a pledge\u2014no sentiment\u2014the seal of a practical\r\ncompact,\u201D he said more quietly, but still retaining her hand in his\r\nfirm grasp. \u201CCome, now!\u201D And Boldwood slipped the ring on her finger.\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot wear it,\u201D she said, weeping as if her heart would break. \u201CYou\r\nfrighten me, almost. So wild a scheme! Please let me go home!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COnly to-night: wear it just to-night, to please me!\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba sat down in a chair, and buried her face in her handkerchief,\r\nthough Boldwood kept her hand yet. At length she said, in a sort of\r\nhopeless whisper\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well, then, I will to-night, if you wish it so earnestly. Now\r\nloosen my hand; I will, indeed I will wear it to-night.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd it shall be the beginning of a pleasant secret courtship of six\r\nyears, with a wedding at the end?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt must be, I suppose, since you will have it so!\u201D she said, fairly\r\nbeaten into non-resistance.\r\n\r\nBoldwood pressed her hand, and allowed it to drop in her lap. \u201CI am\r\nhappy now,\u201D he said. \u201CGod bless you!\u201D\r\n\r\nHe left the room, and when he thought she might be sufficiently\r\ncomposed sent one of the maids to her. Bathsheba cloaked the effects of\r\nthe late scene as she best could, followed the girl, and in a few\r\nmoments came downstairs with her hat and cloak on, ready to go. To get\r\nto the door it was necessary to pass through the hall, and before doing\r\nso she paused on the bottom of the staircase which descended into one\r\ncorner, to take a last look at the gathering.\r\n\r\nThere was no music or dancing in progress just now. At the lower end,\r\nwhich had been arranged for the work-folk specially, a group conversed\r\nin whispers, and with clouded looks. Boldwood was standing by the\r\nfireplace, and he, too, though so absorbed in visions arising from her\r\npromise that he scarcely saw anything, seemed at that moment to have\r\nobserved their peculiar manner, and their looks askance.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is it you are in doubt about, men?\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nOne of them turned and replied uneasily: \u201CIt was something Laban heard\r\nof, that\u2019s all, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNews? Anybody married or engaged, born or dead?\u201D inquired the farmer,\r\ngaily. \u201CTell it to us, Tall. One would think from your looks and\r\nmysterious ways that it was something very dreadful indeed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh no, sir, nobody is dead,\u201D said Tall.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish somebody was,\u201D said Samway, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you say, Samway?\u201D asked Boldwood, somewhat sharply. \u201CIf you\r\nhave anything to say, speak out; if not, get up another dance.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMrs. Troy has come downstairs,\u201D said Samway to Tall. \u201CIf you want to\r\ntell her, you had better do it now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know what they mean?\u201D the farmer asked Bathsheba, across the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t in the least,\u201D said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nThere was a smart rapping at the door. One of the men opened it\r\ninstantly, and went outside.\r\n\r\n\u201CMrs. Troy is wanted,\u201D he said, on returning.\r\n\r\n\u201CQuite ready,\u201D said Bathsheba. \u201CThough I didn\u2019t tell them to send.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is a stranger, ma\u2019am,\u201D said the man by the door.\r\n\r\n\u201CA stranger?\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CAsk him to come in,\u201D said Boldwood.\r\n\r\nThe message was given, and Troy, wrapped up to his eyes as we have seen\r\nhim, stood in the doorway.\r\n\r\nThere was an unearthly silence, all looking towards the newcomer. Those\r\nwho had just learnt that he was in the neighbourhood recognized him\r\ninstantly; those who did not were perplexed. Nobody noted Bathsheba.\r\nShe was leaning on the stairs. Her brow had heavily contracted; her\r\nwhole face was pallid, her lips apart, her eyes rigidly staring at\r\ntheir visitor.\r\n\r\nBoldwood was among those who did not notice that he was Troy. \u201CCome in,\r\ncome in!\u201D he repeated, cheerfully, \u201Cand drain a Christmas beaker with\r\nus, stranger!\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy next advanced into the middle of the room, took off his cap,\r\nturned down his coat-collar, and looked Boldwood in the face. Even then\r\nBoldwood did not recognize that the impersonator of Heaven\u2019s persistent\r\nirony towards him, who had once before broken in upon his bliss,\r\nscourged him, and snatched his delight away, had come to do these\r\nthings a second time. Troy began to laugh a mechanical laugh: Boldwood\r\nrecognized him now.\r\n\r\nTroy turned to Bathsheba. The poor girl\u2019s wretchedness at this time was\r\nbeyond all fancy or narration. She had sunk down on the lowest stair;\r\nand there she sat, her mouth blue and dry, and her dark eyes fixed\r\nvacantly upon him, as if she wondered whether it were not all a\r\nterrible illusion.\r\n\r\nThen Troy spoke. \u201CBathsheba, I come here for you!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe made no reply.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome home with me: come!\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba moved her feet a little, but did not rise. Troy went across\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, madam, do you hear what I say?\u201D he said, peremptorily.\r\n\r\nA strange voice came from the fireplace\u2014a voice sounding far off and\r\nconfined, as if from a dungeon. Hardly a soul in the assembly\r\nrecognized the thin tones to be those of Boldwood. Sudden despair had\r\ntransformed him.\r\n\r\n\u201CBathsheba, go with your husband!\u201D\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she did not move. The truth was that Bathsheba was beyond\r\nthe pale of activity\u2014and yet not in a swoon. She was in a state of\r\nmental _gutta serena_; her mind was for the minute totally deprived of\r\nlight at the same time no obscuration was apparent from without.\r\n\r\nTroy stretched out his hand to pull her towards him, when she quickly\r\nshrank back. This visible dread of him seemed to irritate Troy, and he\r\nseized her arm and pulled it sharply. Whether his grasp pinched her, or\r\nwhether his mere touch was the cause, was never known, but at the\r\nmoment of his seizure she writhed, and gave a quick, low scream.\r\n\r\nThe scream had been heard but a few seconds when it was followed by\r\nsudden deafening report that echoed through the room and stupefied them\r\nall. The oak partition shook with the concussion, and the place was\r\nfilled with grey smoke.\r\n\r\nIn bewilderment they turned their eyes to Boldwood. At his back, as\r\nstood before the fireplace, was a gun-rack, as is usual in farmhouses,\r\nconstructed to hold two guns. When Bathsheba had cried out in her\r\nhusband\u2019s grasp, Boldwood\u2019s face of gnashing despair had changed. The\r\nveins had swollen, and a frenzied look had gleamed in his eye. He had\r\nturned quickly, taken one of the guns, cocked it, and at once\r\ndischarged it at Troy.\r\n\r\nTroy fell. The distance apart of the two men was so small that the\r\ncharge of shot did not spread in the least, but passed like a bullet\r\ninto his body. He uttered a long guttural sigh\u2014there was a\r\ncontraction\u2014an extension\u2014then his muscles relaxed, and he lay still.\r\n\r\nBoldwood was seen through the smoke to be now again engaged with the\r\ngun. It was double-barrelled, and he had, meanwhile, in some way\r\nfastened his hand-kerchief to the trigger, and with his foot on the\r\nother end was in the act of turning the second barrel upon himself.\r\nSamway his man was the first to see this, and in the midst of the\r\ngeneral horror darted up to him. Boldwood had already twitched the\r\nhandkerchief, and the gun exploded a second time, sending its contents,\r\nby a timely blow from Samway, into the beam which crossed the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, it makes no difference!\u201D Boldwood gasped. \u201CThere is another way\r\nfor me to die.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he broke from Samway, crossed the room to Bathsheba, and kissed\r\nher hand. He put on his hat, opened the door, and went into the\r\ndarkness, nobody thinking of preventing him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\nAFTER THE SHOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nBoldwood passed into the high road and turned in the direction of\r\nCasterbridge. Here he walked at an even, steady pace over Yalbury Hill,\r\nalong the dead level beyond, mounted Mellstock Hill, and between eleven\r\nand twelve o\u2019clock crossed the Moor into the town. The streets were\r\nnearly deserted now, and the waving lamp-flames only lighted up rows of\r\ngrey shop-shutters, and strips of white paving upon which his step\r\nechoed as his passed along. He turned to the right, and halted before\r\nan archway of heavy stonework, which was closed by an iron studded pair\r\nof doors. This was the entrance to the gaol, and over it a lamp was\r\nfixed, the light enabling the wretched traveller to find a bell-pull.\r\n\r\nThe small wicket at last opened, and a porter appeared. Boldwood\r\nstepped forward, and said something in a low tone, when, after a delay,\r\nanother man came. Boldwood entered, and the door was closed behind him,\r\nand he walked the world no more.\r\n\r\nLong before this time Weatherbury had been thoroughly aroused, and the\r\nwild deed which had terminated Boldwood\u2019s merrymaking became known to\r\nall. Of those out of the house Oak was one of the first to hear of the\r\ncatastrophe, and when he entered the room, which was about five minutes\r\nafter Boldwood\u2019s exit, the scene was terrible. All the female guests\r\nwere huddled aghast against the walls like sheep in a storm, and the\r\nmen were bewildered as to what to do. As for Bathsheba, she had\r\nchanged. She was sitting on the floor beside the body of Troy, his head\r\npillowed in her lap, where she had herself lifted it. With one hand she\r\nheld her handkerchief to his breast and covered the wound, though\r\nscarcely a single drop of blood had flowed, and with the other she\r\ntightly clasped one of his. The household convulsion had made her\r\nherself again. The temporary coma had ceased, and activity had come\r\nwith the necessity for it. Deeds of endurance, which seem ordinary in\r\nphilosophy, are rare in conduct, and Bathsheba was astonishing all\r\naround her now, for her philosophy was her conduct, and she seldom\r\nthought practicable what she did not practise. She was of the stuff of\r\nwhich great men\u2019s mothers are made. She was indispensable to high\r\ngeneration, hated at tea parties, feared in shops, and loved at crises.\r\nTroy recumbent in his wife\u2019s lap formed now the sole spectacle in the\r\nmiddle of the spacious room.\r\n\r\n\u201CGabriel,\u201D she said, automatically, when he entered, turning up a face\r\nof which only the well-known lines remained to tell him it was hers,\r\nall else in the picture having faded quite. \u201CRide to Casterbridge\r\ninstantly for a surgeon. It is, I believe, useless, but go. Mr.\r\nBoldwood has shot my husband.\u201D\r\n\r\nHer statement of the fact in such quiet and simple words came with more\r\nforce than a tragic declamation, and had somewhat the effect of setting\r\nthe distorted images in each mind present into proper focus. Oak,\r\nalmost before he had comprehended anything beyond the briefest abstract\r\nof the event, hurried out of the room, saddled a horse and rode away.\r\nNot till he had ridden more than a mile did it occur to him that he\r\nwould have done better by sending some other man on this errand,\r\nremaining himself in the house. What had become of Boldwood? He should\r\nhave been looked after. Was he mad\u2014had there been a quarrel? Then how\r\nhad Troy got there? Where had he come from? How did this remarkable\r\nreappearance effect itself when he was supposed by many to be at the\r\nbottom of the sea? Oak had in some slight measure been prepared for the\r\npresence of Troy by hearing a rumour of his return just before entering\r\nBoldwood\u2019s house; but before he had weighed that information, this\r\nfatal event had been superimposed. However, it was too late now to\r\nthink of sending another messenger, and he rode on, in the excitement\r\nof these self-inquiries not discerning, when about three miles from\r\nCasterbridge, a square-figured pedestrian passing along under the dark\r\nhedge in the same direction as his own.\r\n\r\nThe miles necessary to be traversed, and other hindrances incidental to\r\nthe lateness of the hour and the darkness of the night, delayed the\r\narrival of Mr. Aldritch, the surgeon; and more than three hours passed\r\nbetween the time at which the shot was fired and that of his entering\r\nthe house. Oak was additionally detained in Casterbridge through having\r\nto give notice to the authorities of what had happened; and he then\r\nfound that Boldwood had also entered the town, and delivered himself\r\nup.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the surgeon, having hastened into the hall at\r\nBoldwood\u2019s, found it in darkness and quite deserted. He went on to the\r\nback of the house, where he discovered in the kitchen an old man, of\r\nwhom he made inquiries.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s had him took away to her own house, sir,\u201D said his informant.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho has?\u201D said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\u201CMrs. Troy. \u2019A was quite dead, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis was astonishing information. \u201CShe had no right to do that,\u201D said\r\nthe doctor. \u201CThere will have to be an inquest, and she should have\r\nwaited to know what to do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, sir; it was hinted to her that she had better wait till the law\r\nwas known. But she said law was nothing to her, and she wouldn\u2019t let\r\nher dear husband\u2019s corpse bide neglected for folks to stare at for all\r\nthe crowners in England.\u201D\r\n\r\nMr. Aldritch drove at once back again up the hill to Bathsheba\u2019s. The\r\nfirst person he met was poor Liddy, who seemed literally to have\r\ndwindled smaller in these few latter hours. \u201CWhat has been done?\u201D he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know, sir,\u201D said Liddy, with suspended breath. \u201CMy mistress\r\nhas done it all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere is she?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CUpstairs with him, sir. When he was brought home and taken upstairs,\r\nshe said she wanted no further help from the men. And then she called\r\nme, and made me fill the bath, and after that told me I had better go\r\nand lie down because I looked so ill. Then she locked herself into the\r\nroom alone with him, and would not let a nurse come in, or anybody at\r\nall. But I thought I\u2019d wait in the next room in case she should want\r\nme. I heard her moving about inside for more than an hour, but she only\r\ncame out once, and that was for more candles, because hers had burnt\r\ndown into the socket. She said we were to let her know when you or Mr.\r\nThirdly came, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\nOak entered with the parson at this moment, and they all went upstairs\r\ntogether, preceded by Liddy Smallbury. Everything was silent as the\r\ngrave when they paused on the landing. Liddy knocked, and Bathsheba\u2019s\r\ndress was heard rustling across the room: the key turned in the lock,\r\nand she opened the door. Her looks were calm and nearly rigid, like a\r\nslightly animated bust of Melpomene.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Mr. Aldritch, you have come at last,\u201D she murmured from her lips\r\nmerely, and threw back the door. \u201CAh, and Mr. Thirdly. Well, all is\r\ndone, and anybody in the world may see him now.\u201D She then passed by\r\nhim, crossed the landing, and entered another room.\r\n\r\nLooking into the chamber of death she had vacated they saw by the light\r\nof the candles which were on the drawers a tall straight shape lying at\r\nthe further end of the bedroom, wrapped in white. Everything around was\r\nquite orderly. The doctor went in, and after a few minutes returned to\r\nthe landing again, where Oak and the parson still waited.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is all done, indeed, as she says,\u201D remarked Mr. Aldritch, in a\r\nsubdued voice. \u201CThe body has been undressed and properly laid out in\r\ngrave clothes. Gracious Heaven\u2014this mere girl! She must have the nerve\r\nof a stoic!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe heart of a wife merely,\u201D floated in a whisper about the ears of\r\nthe three, and turning they saw Bathsheba in the midst of them. Then,\r\nas if at that instant to prove that her fortitude had been more of will\r\nthan of spontaneity, she silently sank down between them and was a\r\nshapeless heap of drapery on the floor. The simple consciousness that\r\nsuperhuman strain was no longer required had at once put a period to\r\nher power to continue it.\r\n\r\nThey took her away into a further room, and the medical attendance\r\nwhich had been useless in Troy\u2019s case was invaluable in Bathsheba\u2019s,\r\nwho fell into a series of fainting-fits that had a serious aspect for a\r\ntime. The sufferer was got to bed, and Oak, finding from the bulletins\r\nthat nothing really dreadful was to be apprehended on her score, left\r\nthe house. Liddy kept watch in Bathsheba\u2019s chamber, where she heard her\r\nmistress, moaning in whispers through the dull slow hours of that\r\nwretched night: \u201COh it is my fault\u2014how can I live! O Heaven, how can I\r\nlive!\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\nTHE MARCH FOLLOWING\u2014\u201CBATHSHEBA BOLDWOOD\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nWe pass rapidly on into the month of March, to a breezy day without\r\nsunshine, frost, or dew. On Yalbury Hill, about midway between\r\nWeatherbury and Casterbridge, where the turnpike road passes over the\r\ncrest, a numerous concourse of people had gathered, the eyes of the\r\ngreater number being frequently stretched afar in a northerly\r\ndirection. The groups consisted of a throng of idlers, a party of\r\njavelin-men, and two trumpeters, and in the midst were carriages, one\r\nof which contained the high sheriff. With the idlers, many of whom had\r\nmounted to the top of a cutting formed for the road, were several\r\nWeatherbury men and boys\u2014among others Poorgrass, Coggan, and Cain Ball.\r\n\r\nAt the end of half-an-hour a faint dust was seen in the expected\r\nquarter, and shortly after a travelling-carriage, bringing one of the\r\ntwo judges on the Western Circuit, came up the hill and halted on the\r\ntop. The judge changed carriages whilst a flourish was blown by the\r\nbig-cheeked trumpeters, and a procession being formed of the vehicles\r\nand javelin-men, they all proceeded towards the town, excepting the\r\nWeatherbury men, who as soon as they had seen the judge move off\r\nreturned home again to their work.\r\n\r\n\u201CJoseph, I seed you squeezing close to the carriage,\u201D said Coggan, as\r\nthey walked. \u201CDid ye notice my lord judge\u2019s face?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI did,\u201D said Poorgrass. \u201CI looked hard at en, as if I would read his\r\nvery soul; and there was mercy in his eyes\u2014or to speak with the exact\r\ntruth required of us at this solemn time, in the eye that was towards\r\nme.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I hope for the best,\u201D said Coggan, \u201Cthough bad that must be.\r\nHowever, I shan\u2019t go to the trial, and I\u2019d advise the rest of ye that\r\nbain\u2019t wanted to bide away. \u2019Twill disturb his mind more than anything\r\nto see us there staring at him as if he were a show.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe very thing I said this morning,\u201D observed Joseph, \u201C\u2018Justice is\r\ncome to weigh him in the balances,\u2019 I said in my reflectious way, \u2018and\r\nif he\u2019s found wanting, so be it unto him,\u2019 and a bystander said \u2018Hear,\r\nhear! A man who can talk like that ought to be heard.\u2019 But I don\u2019t like\r\ndwelling upon it, for my few words are my few words, and not much;\r\nthough the speech of some men is rumoured abroad as though by nature\r\nformed for such.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSo \u2019tis, Joseph. And now, neighbours, as I said, every man bide at\r\nhome.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe resolution was adhered to; and all waited anxiously for the news\r\nnext day. Their suspense was diverted, however, by a discovery which\r\nwas made in the afternoon, throwing more light on Boldwood\u2019s conduct\r\nand condition than any details which had preceded it.\r\n\r\nThat he had been from the time of Greenhill Fair until the fatal\r\nChristmas Eve in excited and unusual moods was known to those who had\r\nbeen intimate with him; but nobody imagined that there had shown in him\r\nunequivocal symptoms of the mental derangement which Bathsheba and Oak,\r\nalone of all others and at different times, had momentarily suspected.\r\nIn a locked closet was now discovered an extraordinary collection of\r\narticles. There were several sets of ladies\u2019 dresses in the piece, of\r\nsundry expensive materials; silks and satins, poplins and velvets, all\r\nof colours which from Bathsheba\u2019s style of dress might have been judged\r\nto be her favourites. There were two muffs, sable and ermine. Above all\r\nthere was a case of jewellery, containing four heavy gold bracelets and\r\nseveral lockets and rings, all of fine quality and manufacture. These\r\nthings had been bought in Bath and other towns from time to time, and\r\nbrought home by stealth. They were all carefully packed in paper, and\r\neach package was labelled \u201CBathsheba Boldwood,\u201D a date being subjoined\r\nsix years in advance in every instance.\r\n\r\nThese somewhat pathetic evidences of a mind crazed with care and love\r\nwere the subject of discourse in Warren\u2019s malt-house when Oak entered\r\nfrom Casterbridge with tidings of the sentence. He came in the\r\nafternoon, and his face, as the kiln glow shone upon it, told the tale\r\nsufficiently well. Boldwood, as every one supposed he would do, had\r\npleaded guilty, and had been sentenced to death.\r\n\r\nThe conviction that Boldwood had not been morally responsible for his\r\nlater acts now became general. Facts elicited previous to the trial had\r\npointed strongly in the same direction, but they had not been of\r\nsufficient weight to lead to an order for an examination into the state\r\nof Boldwood\u2019s mind. It was astonishing, now that a presumption of\r\ninsanity was raised, how many collateral circumstances were remembered\r\nto which a condition of mental disease seemed to afford the only\r\nexplanation\u2014among others, the unprecedented neglect of his corn stacks\r\nin the previous summer.\r\n\r\nA petition was addressed to the Home Secretary, advancing the\r\ncircumstances which appeared to justify a request for a reconsideration\r\nof the sentence. It was not \u201Cnumerously signed\u201D by the inhabitants of\r\nCasterbridge, as is usual in such cases, for Boldwood had never made\r\nmany friends over the counter. The shops thought it very natural that a\r\nman who, by importing direct from the producer, had daringly set aside\r\nthe first great principle of provincial existence, namely that God made\r\ncountry villages to supply customers to county towns, should have\r\nconfused ideas about the Decalogue. The prompters were a few merciful\r\nmen who had perhaps too feelingly considered the facts latterly\r\nunearthed, and the result was that evidence was taken which it was\r\nhoped might remove the crime in a moral point of view, out of the\r\ncategory of wilful murder, and lead it to be regarded as a sheer\r\noutcome of madness.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of the petition was waited for in Weatherbury with\r\nsolicitous interest. The execution had been fixed for eight o\u2019clock on\r\na Saturday morning about a fortnight after the sentence was passed, and\r\nup to Friday afternoon no answer had been received. At that time\r\nGabriel came from Casterbridge Gaol, whither he had been to wish\r\nBoldwood good-bye, and turned down a by-street to avoid the town. When\r\npast the last house he heard a hammering, and lifting his bowed head he\r\nlooked back for a moment. Over the chimneys he could see the upper part\r\nof the gaol entrance, rich and glowing in the afternoon sun, and some\r\nmoving figures were there. They were carpenters lifting a post into a\r\nvertical position within the parapet. He withdrew his eyes quickly, and\r\nhastened on.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when he reached home, and half the village was out to meet\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo tidings,\u201D Gabriel said, wearily. \u201CAnd I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no hope.\r\nI\u2019ve been with him more than two hours.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo ye think he _really_ was out of his mind when he did it?\u201D said\r\nSmallbury.\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t honestly say that I do,\u201D Oak replied. \u201CHowever, that we can\r\ntalk of another time. Has there been any change in mistress this\r\nafternoon?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNone at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs she downstairs?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo. And getting on so nicely as she was too. She\u2019s but very little\r\nbetter now again than she was at Christmas. She keeps on asking if you\r\nbe come, and if there\u2019s news, till one\u2019s wearied out wi\u2019 answering her.\r\nShall I go and say you\u2019ve come?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Oak. \u201CThere\u2019s a chance yet; but I couldn\u2019t stay in town any\r\nlonger\u2014after seeing him too. So Laban\u2014Laban is here, isn\u2019t he?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Tall.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat I\u2019ve arranged is, that you shall ride to town the last thing\r\nto-night; leave here about nine, and wait a while there, getting home\r\nabout twelve. If nothing has been received by eleven to-night, they say\r\nthere\u2019s no chance at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do so hope his life will be spared,\u201D said Liddy. \u201CIf it is not,\r\nshe\u2019ll go out of her mind too. Poor thing; her sufferings have been\r\ndreadful; she deserves anybody\u2019s pity.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs she altered much?\u201D said Coggan.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you haven\u2019t seen poor mistress since Christmas, you wouldn\u2019t know\r\nher,\u201D said Liddy. \u201CHer eyes are so miserable that she\u2019s not the same\r\nwoman. Only two years ago she was a romping girl, and now she\u2019s this!\u201D\r\n\r\nLaban departed as directed, and at eleven o\u2019clock that night several of\r\nthe villagers strolled along the road to Casterbridge and awaited his\r\narrival\u2014among them Oak, and nearly all the rest of Bathsheba\u2019s men.\r\nGabriel\u2019s anxiety was great that Boldwood might be saved, even though\r\nin his conscience he felt that he ought to die; for there had been\r\nqualities in the farmer which Oak loved. At last, when they all were\r\nweary the tramp of a horse was heard in the distance\u2014\r\n\r\nFirst dead, as if on turf it trode,\r\nThen, clattering on the village road\r\nIn other pace than forth he yode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CWe shall soon know now, one way or other.\u201D said Coggan, and they all\r\nstepped down from the bank on which they had been standing into the\r\nroad, and the rider pranced into the midst of them.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that you, Laban?\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014\u2019tis come. He\u2019s not to die. \u2019Tis confinement during Her Majesty\u2019s\r\npleasure.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHurrah!\u201D said Coggan, with a swelling heart. \u201CGod\u2019s above the devil\r\nyet!\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI\r\nBEAUTY IN LONELINESS\u2014AFTER ALL\r\n\r\n\r\nBathsheba revived with the spring. The utter prostration that had\r\nfollowed the low fever from which she had suffered diminished\r\nperceptibly when all uncertainty upon every subject had come to an end.\r\n\r\nBut she remained alone now for the greater part of her time, and stayed\r\nin the house, or at furthest went into the garden. She shunned every\r\none, even Liddy, and could be brought to make no confidences, and to\r\nask for no sympathy.\r\n\r\nAs the summer drew on she passed more of her time in the open air, and\r\nbegan to examine into farming matters from sheer necessity, though she\r\nnever rode out or personally superintended as at former times. One\r\nFriday evening in August she walked a little way along the road and\r\nentered the village for the first time since the sombre event of the\r\npreceding Christmas. None of the old colour had as yet come to her\r\ncheek, and its absolute paleness was heightened by the jet black of her\r\ngown, till it appeared preternatural. When she reached a little shop at\r\nthe other end of the place, which stood nearly opposite to the\r\nchurchyard, Bathsheba heard singing inside the church, and she knew\r\nthat the singers were practising. She crossed the road, opened the\r\ngate, and entered the graveyard, the high sills of the church windows\r\neffectually screening her from the eyes of those gathered within. Her\r\nstealthy walk was to the nook wherein Troy had worked at planting\r\nflowers upon Fanny Robin\u2019s grave, and she came to the marble tombstone.\r\n\r\nA motion of satisfaction enlivened her face as she read the complete\r\ninscription. First came the words of Troy himself:\u2014\r\n\r\nErected by Francis Troy\r\nIn Beloved Memory of\r\nFanny Robin\r\nWho died October 9, 18\u2014,\r\nAged 20 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderneath this was now inscribed in new letters:\u2014\r\n\r\nIn the Same Grave lie\r\nThe Remains of the aforesaid\r\nFrancis Troy,\r\nWho died December 24th, 18\u2014,\r\nAged 26 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst she stood and read and meditated the tones of the organ began\r\nagain in the church, and she went with the same light step round to the\r\nporch and listened. The door was closed, and the choir was learning a\r\nnew hymn. Bathsheba was stirred by emotions which latterly she had\r\nassumed to be altogether dead within her. The little attenuated voices\r\nof the children brought to her ear in distinct utterance the words they\r\nsang without thought or comprehension\u2014\r\n\r\nLead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,\r\nLead Thou me on.\r\n\r\n\r\nBathsheba\u2019s feeling was always to some extent dependent upon her whim,\r\nas is the case with many other women. Something big came into her\r\nthroat and an uprising to her eyes\u2014and she thought that she would allow\r\nthe imminent tears to flow if they wished. They did flow and\r\nplenteously, and one fell upon the stone bench beside her. Once that\r\nshe had begun to cry for she hardly knew what, she could not leave off\r\nfor crowding thoughts she knew too well. She would have given anything\r\nin the world to be, as those children were, unconcerned at the meaning\r\nof their words, because too innocent to feel the necessity for any such\r\nexpression. All the impassioned scenes of her brief experience seemed\r\nto revive with added emotion at that moment, and those scenes which had\r\nbeen without emotion during enactment had emotion then. Yet grief came\r\nto her rather as a luxury than as the scourge of former times.\r\n\r\nOwing to Bathsheba\u2019s face being buried in her hands she did not notice\r\na form which came quietly into the porch, and on seeing her, first\r\nmoved as if to retreat, then paused and regarded her. Bathsheba did not\r\nraise her head for some time, and when she looked round her face was\r\nwet, and her eyes drowned and dim. \u201CMr. Oak,\u201D exclaimed she,\r\ndisconcerted, \u201Chow long have you been here?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA few minutes, ma\u2019am,\u201D said Oak, respectfully.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you going in?\u201D said Bathsheba; and there came from within the\r\nchurch as from a prompter\u2014\r\n\r\nI loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,\r\nPride ruled my will: remember not past years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CI was,\u201D said Gabriel. \u201CI am one of the bass singers, you know. I have\r\nsung bass for several months.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed: I wasn\u2019t aware of that. I\u2019ll leave you, then.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhich I have loved long since, and lost awhile,\r\n\r\n\r\nsang the children.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t let me drive you away, mistress. I think I won\u2019t go in\r\nto-night.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh no\u2014you don\u2019t drive me away.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen they stood in a state of some embarrassment, Bathsheba trying to\r\nwipe her dreadfully drenched and inflamed face without his noticing\r\nher. At length Oak said, \u201CI\u2019ve not seen you\u2014I mean spoken to you\u2014since\r\never so long, have I?\u201D But he feared to bring distressing memories\r\nback, and interrupted himself with: \u201CWere you going into church?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D she said. \u201CI came to see the tombstone privately\u2014to see if they\r\nhad cut the inscription as I wished. Mr. Oak, you needn\u2019t mind speaking\r\nto me, if you wish to, on the matter which is in both our minds at this\r\nmoment.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd have they done it as you wished?\u201D said Oak.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. Come and see it, if you have not already.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo together they went and read the tomb. \u201CEight months ago!\u201D Gabriel\r\nmurmured when he saw the date. \u201CIt seems like yesterday to me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd to me as if it were years ago\u2014long years, and I had been dead\r\nbetween. And now I am going home, Mr. Oak.\u201D\r\n\r\nOak walked after her. \u201CI wanted to name a small matter to you as soon\r\nas I could,\u201D he said, with hesitation. \u201CMerely about business, and I\r\nthink I may just mention it now, if you\u2019ll allow me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh yes, certainly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is that I may soon have to give up the management of your farm,\r\nMrs. Troy. The fact is, I am thinking of leaving England\u2014not yet, you\r\nknow\u2014next spring.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLeaving England!\u201D she said, in surprise and genuine disappointment.\r\n\u201CWhy, Gabriel, what are you going to do that for?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I\u2019ve thought it best,\u201D Oak stammered out. \u201CCalifornia is the\r\nspot I\u2019ve had in my mind to try.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut it is understood everywhere that you are going to take poor Mr.\r\nBoldwood\u2019s farm on your own account.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve had the refusal o\u2019 it \u2019tis true; but nothing is settled yet, and\r\nI have reasons for giving up. I shall finish out my year there as\r\nmanager for the trustees, but no more.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what shall I do without you? Oh, Gabriel, I don\u2019t think you ought\r\nto go away. You\u2019ve been with me so long\u2014through bright times and dark\r\ntimes\u2014such old friends as we are\u2014that it seems unkind almost. I had\r\nfancied that if you leased the other farm as master, you might still\r\ngive a helping look across at mine. And now going away!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI would have willingly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYet now that I am more helpless than ever you go away!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, that\u2019s the ill fortune o\u2019 it,\u201D said Gabriel, in a distressed\r\ntone. \u201CAnd it is because of that very helplessness that I feel bound to\r\ngo. Good afternoon, ma\u2019am\u201D he concluded, in evident anxiety to get\r\naway, and at once went out of the churchyard by a path she could follow\r\non no pretence whatever.\r\n\r\nBathsheba went home, her mind occupied with a new trouble, which being\r\nrather harassing than deadly was calculated to do good by diverting her\r\nfrom the chronic gloom of her life. She was set thinking a great deal\r\nabout Oak and of his wish to shun her; and there occurred to Bathsheba\r\nseveral incidents of her latter intercourse with him, which, trivial\r\nwhen singly viewed, amounted together to a perceptible disinclination\r\nfor her society. It broke upon her at length as a great pain that her\r\nlast old disciple was about to forsake her and flee. He who had\r\nbelieved in her and argued on her side when all the rest of the world\r\nwas against her, had at last like the others become weary and\r\nneglectful of the old cause, and was leaving her to fight her battles\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThree weeks went on, and more evidence of his want of interest in her\r\nwas forthcoming. She noticed that instead of entering the small parlour\r\nor office where the farm accounts were kept, and waiting, or leaving a\r\nmemorandum as he had hitherto done during her seclusion, Oak never came\r\nat all when she was likely to be there, only entering at unseasonable\r\nhours when her presence in that part of the house was least to be\r\nexpected. Whenever he wanted directions he sent a message, or note with\r\nneither heading nor signature, to which she was obliged to reply in the\r\nsame offhand style. Poor Bathsheba began to suffer now from the most\r\ntorturing sting of all\u2014a sensation that she was despised.\r\n\r\nThe autumn wore away gloomily enough amid these melancholy conjectures,\r\nand Christmas-day came, completing a year of her legal widowhood, and\r\ntwo years and a quarter of her life alone. On examining her heart it\r\nappeared beyond measure strange that the subject of which the season\r\nmight have been supposed suggestive\u2014the event in the hall at\r\nBoldwood\u2019s\u2014was not agitating her at all; but instead, an agonizing\r\nconviction that everybody abjured her\u2014for what she could not tell\u2014and\r\nthat Oak was the ringleader of the recusants. Coming out of church that\r\nday she looked round in hope that Oak, whose bass voice she had heard\r\nrolling out from the gallery overhead in a most unconcerned manner,\r\nmight chance to linger in her path in the old way. There he was, as\r\nusual, coming down the path behind her. But on seeing Bathsheba turn,\r\nhe looked aside, and as soon as he got beyond the gate, and there was\r\nthe barest excuse for a divergence, he made one, and vanished.\r\n\r\nThe next morning brought the culminating stroke; she had been expecting\r\nit long. It was a formal notice by letter from him that he should not\r\nrenew his engagement with her for the following Lady-day.\r\n\r\nBathsheba actually sat and cried over this letter most bitterly. She\r\nwas aggrieved and wounded that the possession of hopeless love from\r\nGabriel, which she had grown to regard as her inalienable right for\r\nlife, should have been withdrawn just at his own pleasure in this way.\r\nShe was bewildered too by the prospect of having to rely on her own\r\nresources again: it seemed to herself that she never could again\r\nacquire energy sufficient to go to market, barter, and sell. Since\r\nTroy\u2019s death Oak had attended all sales and fairs for her, transacting\r\nher business at the same time with his own. What should she do now? Her\r\nlife was becoming a desolation.\r\n\r\nSo desolate was Bathsheba this evening, that in an absolute hunger for\r\npity and sympathy, and miserable in that she appeared to have outlived\r\nthe only true friendship she had ever owned, she put on her bonnet and\r\ncloak and went down to Oak\u2019s house just after sunset, guided on her way\r\nby the pale primrose rays of a crescent moon a few days old.\r\n\r\nA lively firelight shone from the window, but nobody was visible in the\r\nroom. She tapped nervously, and then thought it doubtful if it were\r\nright for a single woman to call upon a bachelor who lived alone,\r\nalthough he was her manager, and she might be supposed to call on\r\nbusiness without any real impropriety. Gabriel opened the door, and the\r\nmoon shone upon his forehead.\r\n\r\n\u201CMr. Oak,\u201D said Bathsheba, faintly.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; I am Mr. Oak,\u201D said Gabriel. \u201CWho have I the honour\u2014O how stupid\r\nof me, not to know you, mistress!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI shall not be your mistress much longer, shall I Gabriel?\u201D she said,\r\nin pathetic tones.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, no. I suppose\u2014But come in, ma\u2019am. Oh\u2014and I\u2019ll get a light,\u201D Oak\r\nreplied, with some awkwardness.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; not on my account.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is so seldom that I get a lady visitor that I\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t\r\nproper accommodation. Will you sit down, please? Here\u2019s a chair, and\r\nthere\u2019s one, too. I am sorry that my chairs all have wood seats, and\r\nare rather hard, but I\u2014was thinking of getting some new ones.\u201D Oak\r\nplaced two or three for her.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey are quite easy enough for me.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo down she sat, and down sat he, the fire dancing in their faces, and\r\nupon the old furniture,\r\n\r\nall a-sheenen\r\nWi\u2019 long years o\u2019 handlen,[3]\r\n\r\n\r\nthat formed Oak\u2019s array of household possessions, which sent back a\r\ndancing reflection in reply. It was very odd to these two persons, who\r\nknew each other passing well, that the mere circumstance of their\r\nmeeting in a new place and in a new way should make them so awkward and\r\nconstrained. In the fields, or at her house, there had never been any\r\nembarrassment; but now that Oak had become the entertainer their lives\r\nseemed to be moved back again to the days when they were strangers.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll think it strange that I have come, but\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh no; not at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I thought\u2014Gabriel, I have been uneasy in the belief that I have\r\noffended you, and that you are going away on that account. It grieved\r\nme very much and I couldn\u2019t help coming.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COffended me! As if you could do that, Bathsheba!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHaven\u2019t I?\u201D she asked, gladly. \u201CBut, what are you going away for\r\nelse?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am not going to emigrate, you know; I wasn\u2019t aware that you would\r\nwish me not to when I told \u2019ee or I shouldn\u2019t ha\u2019 thought of doing it,\u201D\r\nhe said, simply. \u201CI have arranged for Little Weatherbury Farm and shall\r\nhave it in my own hands at Lady-day. You know I\u2019ve had a share in it\r\nfor some time. Still, that wouldn\u2019t prevent my attending to your\r\nbusiness as before, hadn\u2019t it been that things have been said about\r\nus.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D said Bathsheba, in surprise. \u201CThings said about you and me!\r\nWhat are they?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot tell you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt would be wiser if you were to, I think. You have played the part of\r\nmentor to me many times, and I don\u2019t see why you should fear to do it\r\nnow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is nothing that you have done, this time. The top and tail o\u2019t is\r\nthis\u2014that I am sniffing about here, and waiting for poor Boldwood\u2019s\r\nfarm, with a thought of getting you some day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGetting me! What does that mean?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMarrying of \u2019ee, in plain British. You asked me to tell, so you\r\nmustn\u2019t blame me.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a cannon had been\r\ndischarged by her ear, which was what Oak had expected. \u201CMarrying me! I\r\ndidn\u2019t know it was that you meant,\u201D she said, quietly. \u201CSuch a thing as\r\nthat is too absurd\u2014too soon\u2014to think of, by far!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; of course, it is too absurd. I don\u2019t desire any such thing; I\r\nshould think that was plain enough by this time. Surely, surely you be\r\nthe last person in the world I think of marrying. It is too absurd, as\r\nyou say.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Too\u2014s-s-soon\u2019 were the words I used.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI must beg your pardon for correcting you, but you said, \u2018too absurd,\u2019\r\nand so do I.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI beg your pardon too!\u201D she returned, with tears in her eyes. \u201C\u2018Too\r\nsoon\u2019 was what I said. But it doesn\u2019t matter a bit\u2014not at all\u2014but I\r\nonly meant, \u2018too soon.\u2019 Indeed, I didn\u2019t, Mr. Oak, and you must believe\r\nme!\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel looked her long in the face, but the firelight being faint\r\nthere was not much to be seen. \u201CBathsheba,\u201D he said, tenderly and in\r\nsurprise, and coming closer: \u201Cif I only knew one thing\u2014whether you\r\nwould allow me to love you and win you, and marry you after all\u2014if I\r\nonly knew that!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you never will know,\u201D she murmured.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause you never ask.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh\u2014Oh!\u201D said Gabriel, with a low laugh of joyousness. \u201CMy own dear\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou ought not to have sent me that harsh letter this morning,\u201D she\r\ninterrupted. \u201CIt shows you didn\u2019t care a bit about me, and were ready\r\nto desert me like all the rest of them! It was very cruel of you,\r\nconsidering I was the first sweetheart that you ever had, and you were\r\nthe first I ever had; and I shall not forget it!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, Bathsheba, was ever anybody so provoking,\u201D he said, laughing.\r\n\u201CYou know it was purely that I, as an unmarried man, carrying on a\r\nbusiness for you as a very taking young woman, had a proper hard part\r\nto play\u2014more particular that people knew I had a sort of feeling for\r\n\u2019ee; and I fancied, from the way we were mentioned together, that it\r\nmight injure your good name. Nobody knows the heat and fret I have been\r\ncaused by it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd was that all?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAll.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, how glad I am I came!\u201D she exclaimed, thankfully, as she rose from\r\nher seat. \u201CI have thought so much more of you since I fancied you did\r\nnot want even to see me again. But I must be going now, or I shall be\r\nmissed. Why Gabriel,\u201D she said, with a slight laugh, as they went to\r\nthe door, \u201Cit seems exactly as if I had come courting you\u2014how\r\ndreadful!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd quite right too,\u201D said Oak. \u201CI\u2019ve danced at your skittish heels,\r\nmy beautiful Bathsheba, for many a long mile, and many a long day; and\r\nit is hard to begrudge me this one visit.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe accompanied her up the hill, explaining to her the details of his\r\nforthcoming tenure of the other farm. They spoke very little of their\r\nmutual feeling; pretty phrases and warm expressions being probably\r\nunnecessary between such tried friends. Theirs was that substantial\r\naffection which arises (if any arises at all) when the two who are\r\nthrown together begin first by knowing the rougher sides of each\r\nother\u2019s character, and not the best till further on, the romance\r\ngrowing up in the interstices of a mass of hard prosaic reality. This\r\ngood-fellowship\u2014_camaraderie_\u2014usually occurring through similarity of\r\npursuits, is unfortunately seldom superadded to love between the sexes,\r\nbecause men and women associate, not in their labours, but in their\r\npleasures merely. Where, however, happy circumstance permits its\r\ndevelopment, the compounded feeling proves itself to be the only love\r\nwhich is strong as death\u2014that love which many waters cannot quench, nor\r\nthe floods drown, beside which the passion usually called by the name\r\nis evanescent as steam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII\r\nA FOGGY NIGHT AND MORNING\u2014CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CThe most private, secret, plainest wedding that it is possible to\r\nhave.\u201D\r\n\r\nThose had been Bathsheba\u2019s words to Oak one evening, some time after\r\nthe event of the preceding chapter, and he meditated a full hour by the\r\nclock upon how to carry out her wishes to the letter.\r\n\r\n\u201CA license\u2014O yes, it must be a license,\u201D he said to himself at last.\r\n\u201CVery well, then; first, a license.\u201D\r\n\r\nOn a dark night, a few days later, Oak came with mysterious steps from\r\nthe surrogate\u2019s door, in Casterbridge. On the way home he heard a heavy\r\ntread in front of him, and, overtaking the man, found him to be Coggan.\r\nThey walked together into the village until they came to a little lane\r\nbehind the church, leading down to the cottage of Laban Tall, who had\r\nlately been installed as clerk of the parish, and was yet in mortal\r\nterror at church on Sundays when he heard his lone voice among certain\r\nhard words of the Psalms, whither no man ventured to follow him.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, good-night, Coggan,\u201D said Oak, \u201CI\u2019m going down this way.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh!\u201D said Coggan, surprised; \u201Cwhat\u2019s going on to-night then, make so\r\nbold Mr. Oak?\u201D\r\n\r\nIt seemed rather ungenerous not to tell Coggan, under the\r\ncircumstances, for Coggan had been true as steel all through the time\r\nof Gabriel\u2019s unhappiness about Bathsheba, and Gabriel said, \u201CYou can\r\nkeep a secret, Coggan?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve proved me, and you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I have, and I do know. Well, then, mistress and I mean to get\r\nmarried to-morrow morning.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHeaven\u2019s high tower! And yet I\u2019ve thought of such a thing from time to\r\ntime; true, I have. But keeping it so close! Well, there, \u2019tis no\r\nconsarn of of mine, and I wish \u2019ee joy o\u2019 her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, Coggan. But I assure \u2019ee that this great hush is not what I\r\nwished for at all, or what either of us would have wished if it hadn\u2019t\r\nbeen for certain things that would make a gay wedding seem hardly the\r\nthing. Bathsheba has a great wish that all the parish shall not be in\r\nchurch, looking at her\u2014she\u2019s shy-like and nervous about it, in fact\u2014so\r\nI be doing this to humour her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, I see: quite right, too, I suppose I must say. And you be now\r\ngoing down to the clerk.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; you may as well come with me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be throwed away,\u201D\r\nsaid Coggan, as they walked along. \u201CLabe Tall\u2019s old woman will horn it\r\nall over parish in half-an-hour.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSo she will, upon my life; I never thought of that,\u201D said Oak,\r\npausing. \u201CYet I must tell him to-night, I suppose, for he\u2019s working so\r\nfar off, and leaves early.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll tell \u2019ee how we could tackle her,\u201D said Coggan. \u201CI\u2019ll knock and\r\nask to speak to Laban outside the door, you standing in the background.\r\nThen he\u2019ll come out, and you can tell yer tale. She\u2019ll never guess what\r\nI want en for; and I\u2019ll make up a few words about the farm-work, as a\r\nblind.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis scheme was considered feasible; and Coggan advanced boldly, and\r\nrapped at Mrs. Tall\u2019s door. Mrs. Tall herself opened it.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wanted to have a word with Laban.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s not at home, and won\u2019t be this side of eleven o\u2019clock. He\u2019ve been\r\nforced to go over to Yalbury since shutting out work. I shall do quite\r\nas well.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI hardly think you will. Stop a moment;\u201D and Coggan stepped round the\r\ncorner of the porch to consult Oak.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho\u2019s t\u2019other man, then?\u201D said Mrs. Tall.\r\n\r\n\u201COnly a friend,\u201D said Coggan.\r\n\r\n\u201CSay he\u2019s wanted to meet mistress near church-hatch to-morrow morning\r\nat ten,\u201D said Oak, in a whisper. \u201CThat he must come without fail, and\r\nwear his best clothes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe clothes will floor us as safe as houses!\u201D said Coggan.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt can\u2019t be helped,\u201D said Oak. \u201CTell her.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo Coggan delivered the message. \u201CMind, het or wet, blow or snow, he\r\nmust come,\u201D added Jan. \u201C\u2019Tis very particular, indeed. The fact is, \u2019tis\r\nto witness her sign some law-work about taking shares wi\u2019 another\r\nfarmer for a long span o\u2019 years. There, that\u2019s what \u2019tis, and now I\u2019ve\r\ntold \u2019ee, Mother Tall, in a way I shouldn\u2019t ha\u2019 done if I hadn\u2019t loved\r\n\u2019ee so hopeless well.\u201D\r\n\r\nCoggan retired before she could ask any further; and next they called\r\nat the vicar\u2019s in a manner which excited no curiosity at all. Then\r\nGabriel went home, and prepared for the morrow.\r\n\r\n\u201CLiddy,\u201D said Bathsheba, on going to bed that night, \u201CI want you to\r\ncall me at seven o\u2019clock to-morrow, in case I shouldn\u2019t wake.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you always do wake afore then, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, but I have something important to do, which I\u2019ll tell you of when\r\nthe time comes, and it\u2019s best to make sure.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba, however, awoke voluntarily at four, nor could she by any\r\ncontrivance get to sleep again. About six, being quite positive that\r\nher watch had stopped during the night, she could wait no longer. She\r\nwent and tapped at Liddy\u2019s door, and after some labour awoke her.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I thought it was I who had to call you?\u201D said the bewildered\r\nLiddy. \u201CAnd it isn\u2019t six yet.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed it is; how can you tell such a story, Liddy? I know it must be\r\never so much past seven. Come to my room as soon as you can; I want you\r\nto give my hair a good brushing.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen Liddy came to Bathsheba\u2019s room her mistress was already waiting.\r\nLiddy could not understand this extraordinary promptness. \u201CWhatever\r\n_is_ going on, ma\u2019am?\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I\u2019ll tell you,\u201D said Bathsheba, with a mischievous smile in her\r\nbright eyes. \u201CFarmer Oak is coming here to dine with me to-day!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFarmer Oak\u2014and nobody else?\u2014you two alone?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut is it safe, ma\u2019am, after what\u2019s been said?\u201D asked her companion,\r\ndubiously. \u201CA woman\u2019s good name is such a perishable article that\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek, and whispered in Liddy\u2019s ear,\r\nalthough there was nobody present. Then Liddy stared and exclaimed,\r\n\u201CSouls alive, what news! It makes my heart go quite bumpity-bump!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt makes mine rather furious, too,\u201D said Bathsheba. \u201CHowever, there\u2019s\r\nno getting out of it now!\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was a damp disagreeable morning. Nevertheless, at twenty minutes to\r\nten o\u2019clock, Oak came out of his house, and\r\n\r\nWent up the hill side\r\nWith that sort of stride\r\nA man puts out when walking in search of a bride,\r\n\r\n\r\nand knocked at Bathsheba\u2019s door. Ten minutes later a large and a\r\nsmaller umbrella might have been seen moving from the same door, and\r\nthrough the mist along the road to the church. The distance was not\r\nmore than a quarter of a mile, and these two sensible persons deemed it\r\nunnecessary to drive. An observer must have been very close indeed to\r\ndiscover that the forms under the umbrellas were those of Oak and\r\nBathsheba, arm-in-arm for the first time in their lives, Oak in a\r\ngreatcoat extending to his knees, and Bathsheba in a cloak that reached\r\nher clogs. Yet, though so plainly dressed, there was a certain\r\nrejuvenated appearance about her:\u2014\r\n\r\nAs though a rose should shut and be a bud again.\r\n\r\n\r\nRepose had again incarnadined her cheeks; and having, at Gabriel\u2019s\r\nrequest, arranged her hair this morning as she had worn it years ago on\r\nNorcombe Hill, she seemed in his eyes remarkably like a girl of that\r\nfascinating dream, which, considering that she was now only three or\r\nfour-and-twenty, was perhaps not very wonderful. In the church were\r\nTall, Liddy, and the parson, and in a remarkably short space of time\r\nthe deed was done.\r\n\r\nThe two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathsheba\u2019s parlour in the\r\nevening of the same day, for it had been arranged that Farmer Oak\r\nshould go there to live, since he had as yet neither money, house, nor\r\nfurniture worthy of the name, though he was on a sure way towards them,\r\nwhilst Bathsheba was, comparatively, in a plethora of all three.\r\n\r\nJust as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea, their ears were greeted\r\nby the firing of a cannon, followed by what seemed like a tremendous\r\nblowing of trumpets, in the front of the house.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere!\u201D said Oak, laughing, \u201CI knew those fellows were up to\r\nsomething, by the look on their faces.\u201D\r\n\r\nOak took up the light and went into the porch, followed by Bathsheba\r\nwith a shawl over her head. The rays fell upon a group of male figures\r\ngathered upon the gravel in front, who, when they saw the newly-married\r\ncouple in the porch, set up a loud \u201CHurrah!\u201D and at the same moment\r\nbang again went the cannon in the background, followed by a hideous\r\nclang of music from a drum, tambourine, clarionet, serpent, hautboy,\r\ntenor-viol, and double-bass\u2014the only remaining relics of the true and\r\noriginal Weatherbury band\u2014venerable worm-eaten instruments, which had\r\ncelebrated in their own persons the victories of Marlborough, under the\r\nfingers of the forefathers of those who played them now. The performers\r\ncame forward, and marched up to the front.\r\n\r\n\u201CThose bright boys, Mark Clark and Jan, are at the bottom of all this,\u201D\r\nsaid Oak. \u201CCome in, souls, and have something to eat and drink wi\u2019 me\r\nand my wife.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot to-night,\u201D said Mr. Clark, with evident self-denial. \u201CThank ye all\r\nthe same; but we\u2019ll call at a more seemly time. However, we couldn\u2019t\r\nthink of letting the day pass without a note of admiration of some\r\nsort. If ye could send a drop of som\u2019at down to Warren\u2019s, why so it is.\r\nHere\u2019s long life and happiness to neighbour Oak and his comely bride!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank ye; thank ye all,\u201D said Gabriel. \u201CA bit and a drop shall be sent\r\nto Warren\u2019s for ye at once. I had a thought that we might very likely\r\nget a salute of some sort from our old friends, and I was saying so to\r\nmy wife but now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFaith,\u201D said Coggan, in a critical tone, turning to his companions,\r\n\u201Cthe man hev learnt to say \u2018my wife\u2019 in a wonderful naterel way,\r\nconsidering how very youthful he is in wedlock as yet\u2014hey, neighbours\r\nall?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI never heerd a skilful old married feller of twenty years\u2019 standing\r\npipe \u2018my wife\u2019 in a more used note than \u2019a did,\u201D said Jacob Smallbury.\r\n\u201CIt might have been a little more true to nater if\u2019t had been spoke a\r\nlittle chillier, but that wasn\u2019t to be expected just now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat improvement will come wi\u2019 time,\u201D said Jan, twirling his eye.\r\n\r\nThen Oak laughed, and Bathsheba smiled (for she never laughed readily\r\nnow), and their friends turned to go.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; I suppose that\u2019s the size o\u2019t,\u201D said Joseph Poorgrass with a\r\ncheerful sigh as they moved away; \u201Cand I wish him joy o\u2019 her; though I\r\nwere once or twice upon saying to-day with holy Hosea, in my scripture\r\nmanner, which is my second nature, \u2018Ephraim is joined to idols: let him\r\nalone.\u2019 But since \u2019tis as \u2019tis, why, it might have been worse, and I\r\nfeel my thanks accordingly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n [1] This phrase is a conjectural emendation of the unintelligible\r\n expression, \u201Cas the Devil said to the Owl,\u201D used by the natives.\r\n\r\n [2] The local tower and churchyard do not answer precisely to the\r\n foregoing description.\r\n\r\n [3] W.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n
