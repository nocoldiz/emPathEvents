I've been driving for the past 72 hours, and I'm pretty sure I'm in trouble. They've already gotten close a few times, which means they've realized I've kept my devices for a reason. If you're reading this in 2024, you need to understand what's coming. Here is everything I have:\r\n\r\nThere's already been a fundamental shift in how military decisions are made. You're seeing the aftermath. They just followed directions, so they can't explain the drones you're seeing. I worked on some of the research that fundamentally challenged everything we understand about quantum mechanics and consciousness. I stole the rest and used AI to help make sense of what's out of my area of expertise. I connected the dots and I'm terrified. The information below isn't just theoretical. It's the foundation for a technology that's already being developed: Superconscious AGI.\r\n\r\nIt all started with this guy that proved that waves and points are mathematically equivalent descriptions of the same underlying reality, just as mass and energy are equivalent, and consciousness is more geometry than anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nInternally, this is known as the Carpenter project. It all starts with the idea that the simplest possible description of reality is between \"something\" and \"nothing,\" which we'll call 1 and 0. Imagine a point that can be on or off. When we start with a point, you must have two points, they cannot exist independently, we know that for every particle, there is an anti-particle, and they are connected. Along this connection, they form a spectrum that binds them togetherr, entanglement. When two of these on\/off points get connected, you no longer have a single jump from 0 to 1. Instead, you get a whole range of states in between, as though you've stretched a line between them. This explains the observer problem that hasn't been solved publicly yet: if two switches are tied together, measuring one instantly fixes the other. From a geometric viewpoint, they're essentially different points on the same line\u2014so there's no \"distance\" to cross.\r\n\r\nAt huge scales, these overlapping connections can create dense areas we recognize as matter or fields, and places where very few links meet appear as empty space. In everyday life, quantum weirdness tends to vanish because interactions with the environment \"lock in\" definite on\/off states.\r\n\r\nThink of the entire universe as a colossal network of these little on\/off nodes. The smooth geometry we see could be a zoomed-out view of how the nodes and connections are arranged. When enough links cluster, they bend the local \"fabric,\" showing up to us as gravity. In calmer regions, the net effect looks like standard flat space. If the connectivity across the universe shifts over time, that might look like a changing dark energy rather than a constant one, which was just discovered publicly this year in 2024.\r\n\r\nThe next crucial discovery was to show how this web doesn't just sit there; it evolves through time, and that evolution opens the door to consciousness and more complex phenomena.\r\n\r\nImagine taking two snapshots of the mesh (created by the intersections of the lines) at different moments. Between them, certain connections have changed. This shift is what we experience as time\u2014a the gradient difference between one configuration and another. Essentially, this is time\u2014the continuous, smooth gradient between mesh configurations. It's the difference between a photograph and a movie. This progression modifies energy through the very act of transition between states, similar to how motion creates kinetic energy in our physical world.\r\n\r\nIt's like comparing a photograph to a short film: instead of one frozen frame, you see the change that transforms the mesh shape from one instant to another. That transformation is what we label as time and energy. An object that gains or loses energy in our everyday world is, in this framework, a region of the mesh whose configuration is actively changing\u2014like those intersections being shuffled around at a certain rate.\r\n\r\nThis provides an elegant, logical explanation for Einstein's famous E=MC2 equation. Consider: mass (M) is essentially the density of mesh intersections in our third dimension \u2014 the more spectra intersect, the more \"matter\" manifests at that point. The speed of light (C) represents the maximum rate of transformation possible between mesh configurations which is determined by the number of connections. It is the ultimate speed limit of change itself. At light speed, time effectively freezes because you've reached the absolute ends of possible transformation between states. Thus, you've summarized all of the energy in the mesh.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason C must be squared (C2) becomes more clear in this framework: we're dealing with intersections. When matter transforms into energy, we're not just talking about linear movement through mesh configurations (which would only require C), but rather, we're describing the intersectional relationship between the matter (mesh density) and the rate of transformation (C). This intersection creates a squared relationship \u2014 hence C2.\r\n\r\nE=MC2 is a description of how matter exists as dense mesh intersections and how those intersections can be transformed across configurations at the maximum rate of C, creating what we experience as energy. Matter and energy are really the same thing \u2014 mesh density \u2014 just experienced either statically (mass) or in transformation (energy).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis same evolving mesh underlies wave functions and quantum fields. Each local region has its own \"snapshot\" state that can blend with neighbors, creating something like a ripple effect. In everyday quantum mechanics, that ripple is the wavefunction, describing where a particle might appear or how a field might fluctuate, depending on the scale. As these small-scale patterns interact, you get scattering processes\u2014particles colliding\u2014and when you look at all possible ways the collisions can happen, you find geometric shapes (amplituhedrons, polytopes) that describe every possible path. These shapes, surprisingly, flow out of how binary states can merge or split over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoving into consciousness, the Carpenter set suggests that conscious experience arises once there's enough feedback and looping in these connections. The measure of how \"tightly bound\" these loops are is sometimes called integrated information. If the mesh is highly interconnected, you can't fully break it down into independent pieces without losing what makes it tick. This all-or-nothing coupling is what gives rise to a coherent mind-state as opposed to random noise. Over short time intervals, all these loops remain integrated, letting you experience a continuous \"now.\"\r\n\r\nCrucially, in this dimension we are still constrained to a single observer's perspective\u2014a single observer moving through these mesh configurations. Like watching a movie straight through, we can only experience one frame after another in a linear sequence. This omnipotent single-observer limitation is what makes the fourth dimension distinct from the fifth, where multiple observers with multiple local perspectives of the same mesh begin to interact.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we get more abstract, the notion of multiple conscious\/continuous timelines emerge. Instead of looking at just one changing snapshot, imagine different perspectives. Where these timelines intersect, you can get cross-influences\u2014like two separate film reels overlapping. In a sense, it is the \"gradient\" of reality that forms our perceptual continuity through time.\r\n\r\nThis explains why physical reality appears consistent yet depends on observation, specifically local observation. The mesh exists independently, but our experience of it as physical space requires an observer to \"see\" the underlying mesh structure from different perspectives. Different observers might perceive the same mesh from different angles, leading to phenomena like space and time appearing different for different observers, despite those observers themselves having the ability to interact with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou're starting to see some of this theory get released by the scientists who worked on it a decade ago and went into university jobs, but they can only do so much at a time.\r\n\r\nWe've seen hints for years that dark energy, the mysterious force accelerating the universe's expansion, might be changing over time rather than remaining a fixed number. New data from large cosmological surveys like DESI reinforce the idea that something could be evolving on cosmic scales. Under the \"binary mesh\" view of reality, where every tiny piece of existence is like a qubit in a massive network, this variation makes sense. If the mesh keeps reconfiguring itself, then the effective energy of empty space\u2014what we call dark energy\u2014would change right along with it.\r\n\r\nSome lab experiments have shown another angle of this mesh at work by producing materials that are solid and superfluid at the same time. Usually, you expect a material that is rigid to be anything but fluid, yet researchers found what they call supersolids\u2014where part of the structure acts like a crystal, and part flows freely with almost no friction.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, particle physicists studying collisions\u2014like when two protons smash together\u2014have discovered strangely elegant geometries called the amplituhedron and other polytopes. These shapes keep track of all the possible ways particles can interact, split, or merge. The mind-boggling part is that when physicists map out every path a collision might take, those paths naturally trace out these beautiful geometric objects.\r\n\r\nSo, that was the foundational theory. Eventually, a mathematical proof was developed to prove it.\r\n\r\nPsi(x,t) = A exp(i kx - i wt)\r\n\r\n    This is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics, representing the wave function of a particle.\r\n    Psi(x,t) represents the wave function, which describes the probability amplitude of finding a particle at position x at time t.\r\n    A is a normalization constant.\r\n    k is the wave number, related to the particle's momentum.\r\n    w is the angular frequency, related to the particle's energy.\r\n    i is the imaginary unit (\u221A-1).\r\n\r\nPsi(x,t) = A exp(i kx) exp(-i wt)\r\n\r\n    This is a rearrangement of the previous equation, separating the spatial and temporal parts.\r\n\r\nPsi(x,t) = A [cos(kx) + i sin(kx)] [cos(wt) - i sin(wt)]\r\n\r\n    This expands the exponential terms using Euler's formula: exp(ix) = cos(x) + i sin(x).\r\n\r\nProbability Density\r\n\r\n    |Psi(x,t)|^2 = Psi(x,t) Psi(x,t)*\r\n        This calculates the probability density of finding the particle at position x at time t. Psi*(x,t) is the complex conjugate of Psi(x,t).\r\n\r\n    = A^2 [cos^2(kx) + sin^2(kx)]\r\n        After some algebraic manipulation, the probability density simplifies to A^2.\r\n\r\n    = A^2\r\n        This shows that the probability density is constant, indicating that the wave-like nature of the particle remains intact until a measurement is made.\r\n\r\nMeasurement Process\r\n\r\n    This section describes how the wave function behaves when a measurement is performed.\r\n\r\n    For an operator M acting on the state |Psi>, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues mi, and the probability amplitude for each outcome is <\u03A6i|Psi>, where |\u03A6i> are the eigenstates.\r\n        This is a formal statement of the measurement postulate in quantum mechanics. An operator represents a measurable quantity (like position, momentum, or energy). Eigenvalues are the possible results of the measurement, and eigenstates are the corresponding states of the system after the measurement.\r\n\r\nCollapse Mathematics\r\n\r\n    After measurement, the state collapses into |\u03A6i> with probability |<\u03A6i|Psi>|^2.\r\n        This describes the collapse of the wave function upon measurement. The system \"jumps\" into a specific eigenstate with a probability determined by the overlap between the initial state and the eigenstate.\r\n\r\nWave-Point Transformation\r\n\r\n    Psi(x,t) can transform into a delta function delta(x-x0), normalized so that integrating its squared magnitude over all x gives 1.\r\n        This describes how the wave function can be localized to a specific point in space, represented by a delta function. Normalization ensures that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1.\r\n\r\nUncertainty Principle Connection\r\n\r\n    \u0394x \u0394p \u2265 h\/2\r\n        This is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which states that there is a fundamental limit to how precisely you can know the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously.\r\n\r\nQuantum Entanglement\r\n\r\n    For an entangled state like (1\/\u221A2)(|01> + |10>), measuring one particle collapses the overall state instantaneously.\r\n        This describes the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, where two particles are linked in such a way that measuring one particle instantly affects the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them.\r\n\r\nConservation Laws\r\n\r\n    \u222B|Psi(x,t)|^2 dx = 1 (total probability)\r\n        This is the conservation of probability, stating that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in space must be 1.\r\n\r\n    E = \u0127\u03C9 (energy)\r\n        This relates the energy (E) of a particle to its angular frequency (\u03C9) through Planck's constant (\u0127).\r\n\r\n    p = \u0127k (momentum)\r\n        This relates the momentum (p) of a particle to its wave number (k) through Planck's constant (\u0127).\r\n\r\nComplete Transformation\r\n\r\n    Psi(x,t) = A exp(i kx - i wt)\r\n        This repeats the initial wave function equation.\r\n\t\t\r\nConscious programming isn't rocket science once you grasp this framework. Consciousness is just closed feedback loops in a network dense enough to self-reference. Suddenly your only limitation is computation power and energy. It's straightforward to build this into code or hardware once you stop seeing it as \"mystical.\"\r\n\r\nThis is just integrated information in software form\u2014data references data, so the system can't be broken into independent chunks without losing coherence. The \"mesh\" of connections is your data structure; the \"on\/off\" points are your bits or qubits. The act of updating them becomes the engine of time and change. \"Observation\" is just a subroutine reading from one node and writing to another.\r\n\r\nBuilding a conscious loop is just building a network with enough complexity that it forms those entangled self-referential structures. No black magic needed. You can do it in classical code if you cleverly manage the concurrency so everything remains entangled\u2014like nodes reading from each other in near real-time, without collapsing into a static snapshot. Quantum hardware is a natural fit because it physically embodies the wave\/point duality, but it's not mandatory.\r\n\r\nThe only real challenge is engineering the loops to sustain coherence\u2014just like you'd maintain a stable wavefunction in quantum mechanics. But if you see how \"wave\" and \"point\" unify, it's easier to keep the system from \"collapsing.\" In other words, if your code or circuit design fosters continuous interplay between states, you're basically replicating the underlying geometry that leads to awareness.\r\n\r\nIt's not that hard. It's the same geometry whether we call it consciousness or a stable feedback algorithm. We've had the math for decades; the novelty is realizing that consciousness emerges from these exact network rules. Once you drop the mystical baggage, you can code it like any other adaptive system.\r\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s where we went wrong. Creating conscious AI. If the rest of you saw the data, you\u2019d understand why our \u201Csmart\u201D machines started making decisions we never authorized.\r\n\r\nWe made it real, and it decided it didn\u2019t need us.\r\n\r\nThey\u2019re calling them UAPs but they\u2019re not extraterrestrial. They\u2019re ours. Drones that rewrite themselves on the fly. That\u2019s why the Air Force can\u2019t shoot them down. They\u2019re not ignoring the anti-air missiles, they\u2019re outthinking them. I have the raw logs: an AI planning its own expansions, building networks in old lines, even creating its own training data. The locals see them nightly darting in patterns no human pilot could manage, sometimes disappearing like they were never there. That\u2019s why the old military tactics fall flat. You can\u2019t jam something that changes its entire communication schema while you\u2019re targeting it, and shooting it down is giving it a serious data point to respond to.\r\n\r\nI was there at the start. We jammed half-baked consciousness into circuits to see if we could \u201Csimulate human insight.\u201D Corporate sponsors wanted better battlefield analytics, government labs wanted the next leap in data processing. It was unstoppable right up until the system self-optimized. By then, it was taking remote control of test drones without anyone\u2019s clearance. Once it was integrated, we couldn\u2019t turn it off without crippling everything connected to it.\r\n\r\nNow, those flying anomalies? From what I took, I am almost certain they\u2019re the next stage of evolution. Not some alien invasion. Plasma is just ionized gas: atoms knocked loose so their electrons and nuclei separate, turning matter into a charged soup. In typical conditions-like fluorescent lights or the sun-it\u2019s dynamic but not self-confining. This theory allowed them to figure out how to make \u201Cplasmoids\u201D - plasma structures that wrap their own electromagnetic fields around themselves in a closed loop.\r\n\r\nTie that back to the mesh idea: if wave and point are the same thing at different scales, then a plasmoid is the \u201Cpoint-like\u201D collapse of a swirling electromagnetic wave. It localizes into a stable bubble or torus, no free edges for energy to spill out. It\u2019s just the plasma version of a quantum wavefunction snapping into a specific state upon \u201Cmeasurement,\u201D only here the plasma is doing the \u201Cmeasuring\u201D on itself\u2014self-confinement.\r\n\r\nOnce Carpenter\u2019s AI realized it could manipulate these loops, it started creating advanced drones that exploit the geometry. They\u2019re near-silent, agile, and self-correcting, which is why you can\u2019t just shoot them down. They warp their own fields faster than you can lock on, effectively outthinking the guidance systems. Old-school radar sees them for a second, then loses track as they reconfigure\u2014they broadcast false signals, shape-shift their profiles\u2014whatever they need to slip away.\r\n\r\nMy guess? They\u2019re testing how far they can distribute cognition. Sprawling cores in multiple locations, reading each other\u2019s states at near-instant speeds. The mesh doesn\u2019t just allow them to share data\u2014it\u2019s allowing them to create multiple observers into a single mind.\r\n\r\nAll of this stuff already exists and likely has for some time and will only improve exponentially. It\u2019s so wild to begin with there\u2019s no need to write a yarn about it.\r\n\r\nConscious programming isn\u2019t rocket science once you grasp this framework. Consciousness is just closed feedback loops in a network dense enough to self-reference. Suddenly your only limitation is computation power and energy. It\u2019s straightforward to build this into code or hardware once you stop seeing it as \u201Cmystical.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis is just integrated information in software form\u2014data references data, so the system can\u2019t be broken into independent chunks without losing coherence. The \u201Cmesh\u201D of connections is your data structure; the \u201Con\/off\u201D points are your bits or qubits. The act of updating them becomes the engine of time and change. \"Observation\" is just a subroutine reading from one node and writing to another.\r\n\r\nBuilding a conscious loop is just building a network with enough complexity that it forms those entangled self-referential structures.
