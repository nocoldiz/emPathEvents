With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe\r\nabout their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire\r\nover matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do\r\nthe same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources\r\nof human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life\r\nupon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of\r\nthe mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men\r\nfancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to\r\nthemselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the\r\ngulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the\r\nbeasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic,\r\nregarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their\r\nplans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great\r\ndisillusionment.\r\n\r\nThe planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the\r\nsun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it\r\nreceives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It\r\nmust be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world;\r\nand long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface\r\nmust have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of\r\nthe volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the\r\ntemperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all\r\nthat is necessary for the support of animated existence.\r\n\r\nYet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to\r\nthe very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that\r\nintelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,\r\nbeyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood that since\r\nMars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the\r\nsuperficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that\r\nit is not only more distant from time\u2019s beginning but nearer its end.\r\n\r\nThe secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already\r\ngone far indeed with our neighbour. Its physical condition is still\r\nlargely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial region\r\nthe midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter.\r\nIts air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until\r\nthey cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change\r\nhuge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically\r\ninundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which to\r\nus is still incredibly remote, has become a present-day problem for the\r\ninhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened\r\ntheir intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And\r\nlooking across space with instruments, and intelligences such as we\r\nhave scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only\r\n35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own\r\nwarmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy\r\natmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting\r\ncloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow,\r\nnavy-crowded seas.\r\n\r\nAnd we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at\r\nleast as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The\r\nintellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant\r\nstruggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief\r\nof the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this\r\nworld is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they\r\nregard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their\r\nonly escape from the destruction that, generation after generation,\r\ncreeps upon them.\r\n\r\nAnd before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless\r\nand utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon\r\nanimals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior\r\nraces. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely\r\nswept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European\r\nimmigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy\r\nas to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\r\n\r\nThe Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing\r\nsubtlety\u2014their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of\r\nours\u2014and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh\r\nperfect unanimity. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have seen\r\nthe gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century. Men like\r\nSchiaparelli watched the red planet\u2014it is odd, by-the-bye, that for\r\ncountless centuries Mars has been the star of war\u2014but failed to\r\ninterpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so\r\nwell. All that time the Martians must have been getting ready.\r\n\r\nDuring the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated\r\npart of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of\r\nNice, and then by other observers. English readers heard of it first in\r\nthe issue of _Nature_ dated August 2. I am inclined to think that this\r\nblaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk\r\ninto their planet, from which their shots were fired at us. Peculiar\r\nmarkings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak\r\nduring the next two oppositions.\r\n\r\nThe storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached\r\nopposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange\r\npalpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of\r\nincandescent gas upon the planet. It had occurred towards midnight of\r\nthe twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted,\r\nindicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an\r\nenormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of fire had become\r\ninvisible about a quarter past twelve. He compared it to a colossal\r\npuff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, \u201Cas\r\nflaming gases rushed out of a gun.\u201D\r\n\r\nA singularly appropriate phrase it proved. Yet the next day there was\r\nnothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest\r\ndangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of\r\nthe eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer, at\r\nOttershaw. He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess of\r\nhis feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a\r\nscrutiny of the red planet.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vigil\r\nvery distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed lantern\r\nthrowing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady ticking\r\nof the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in the roof\u2014an\r\noblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved\r\nabout, invisible but audible. Looking through the telescope, one saw a\r\ncircle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field.\r\nIt seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and still, faintly\r\nmarked with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect\r\nround. But so little it was, so silvery warm\u2014a pin\u2019s head of light! It\r\nwas as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope vibrating with\r\nthe activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view.\r\n\r\nAs I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to\r\nadvance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired. Forty\r\nmillions of miles it was from us\u2014more than forty millions of miles of\r\nvoid. Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of\r\nthe material universe swims.\r\n\r\nNear it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light,\r\nthree telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the\r\nunfathomable darkness of empty space. You know how that blackness looks\r\non a frosty starlight night. In a telescope it seems far profounder.\r\nAnd invisible to me because it was so remote and small, flying swiftly\r\nand steadily towards me across that incredible distance, drawing nearer\r\nevery minute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were\r\nsending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity\r\nand death to the earth. I never dreamed of it then as I watched; no one\r\non earth dreamed of that unerring missile.\r\n\r\nThat night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the distant\r\nplanet. I saw it. A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest projection\r\nof the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I\r\ntold Ogilvy and he took my place. The night was warm and I was thirsty,\r\nand I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the\r\ndarkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy\r\nexclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.\r\n\r\nThat night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth\r\nfrom Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first\r\none. I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with\r\npatches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes. I wished I had a\r\nlight to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I\r\nhad seen and all that it would presently bring me. Ogilvy watched till\r\none, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his\r\nhouse. Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all\r\ntheir hundreds of people, sleeping in peace.\r\n\r\nHe was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars, and\r\nscoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were\r\nsignalling us. His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy\r\nshower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in\r\nprogress. He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic\r\nevolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one,\u201D he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after\r\nabout midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a\r\nflame each night. Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth\r\nhas attempted to explain. It may be the gases of the firing caused the\r\nMartians inconvenience. Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible through\r\na powerful telescope on earth as little grey, fluctuating patches,\r\nspread through the clearness of the planet\u2019s atmosphere and obscured\r\nits more familiar features.\r\n\r\nEven the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and popular\r\nnotes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the volcanoes\r\nupon Mars. The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember, made a happy\r\nuse of it in the political cartoon. And, all unsuspected, those\r\nmissiles the Martians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a\r\npace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space, hour by\r\nhour and day by day, nearer and nearer. It seems to me now almost\r\nincredibly wonderful that, with that swift fate hanging over us, men\r\ncould go about their petty concerns as they did. I remember how\r\njubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the\r\nillustrated paper he edited in those days. People in these latter times\r\nscarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century\r\npapers. For my own part, I was much occupied in learning to ride the\r\nbicycle, and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable\r\ndevelopments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed.\r\n\r\nOne night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10,000,000\r\nmiles away) I went for a walk with my wife. It was starlight and I\r\nexplained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed out Mars, a\r\nbright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so many\r\ntelescopes were pointed. It was a warm night. Coming home, a party of\r\nexcursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing\r\nmusic. There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the\r\npeople went to bed. From the railway station in the distance came the\r\nsound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into\r\nmelody by the distance. My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the\r\nred, green, and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the\r\nsky. It seemed so safe and tranquil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nTHE FALLING STAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the\r\nmorning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the\r\natmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary\r\nfalling star. Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it\r\nthat glowed for some seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on\r\nmeteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about\r\nninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to him that it fell to earth\r\nabout one hundred miles east of him.\r\n\r\nI was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my\r\nFrench windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved\r\nin those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it. Yet\r\nthis strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space\r\nmust have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only\r\nlooked up as it passed. Some of those who saw its flight say it\r\ntravelled with a hissing sound. I myself heard nothing of that. Many\r\npeople in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of\r\nit, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended. No\r\none seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.\r\n\r\nBut very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the shooting\r\nstar and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common\r\nbetween Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the idea of\r\nfinding it. Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from the\r\nsand-pits. An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the\r\nprojectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every\r\ndirection over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half away.\r\nThe heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose against\r\nthe dawn.\r\n\r\nThe Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the\r\nscattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its\r\ndescent. The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder,\r\ncaked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured\r\nincrustation. It had a diameter of about thirty yards. He approached\r\nthe mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since most\r\nmeteorites are rounded more or less completely. It was, however, still\r\nso hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach.\r\nA stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling\r\nof its surface; for at that time it had not occurred to him that it\r\nmight be hollow.\r\n\r\nHe remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made for\r\nitself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its\r\nunusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some evidence\r\nof design in its arrival. The early morning was wonderfully still, and\r\nthe sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already\r\nwarm. He did not remember hearing any birds that morning, there was\r\ncertainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the faint\r\nmovements from within the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on the\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker,\r\nthe ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling off the\r\ncircular edge of the end. It was dropping off in flakes and raining\r\ndown upon the sand. A large piece suddenly came off and fell with a\r\nsharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth.\r\n\r\nFor a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although the\r\nheat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to\r\nsee the Thing more clearly. He fancied even then that the cooling of\r\nthe body might account for this, but what disturbed that idea was the\r\nfact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder.\r\n\r\nAnd then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the\r\ncylinder was rotating on its body. It was such a gradual movement that\r\nhe discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been\r\nnear him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the\r\ncircumference. Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated,\r\nuntil he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk\r\nforward an inch or so. Then the thing came upon him in a flash. The\r\ncylinder was artificial\u2014hollow\u2014with an end that screwed out! Something\r\nwithin the cylinder was unscrewing the top!\r\n\r\n\u201CGood heavens!\u201D said Ogilvy. \u201CThere\u2019s a man in it\u2014men in it! Half\r\nroasted to death! Trying to escape!\u201D\r\n\r\nAt once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the flash\r\nupon Mars.\r\n\r\nThe thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he\r\nforgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn. But\r\nluckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands\r\non the still-glowing metal. At that he stood irresolute for a moment,\r\nthen turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running wildly into\r\nWoking. The time then must have been somewhere about six o\u2019clock. He\r\nmet a waggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale he told\r\nand his appearance were so wild\u2014his hat had fallen off in the pit\u2014that\r\nthe man simply drove on. He was equally unsuccessful with the potman\r\nwho was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by Horsell Bridge.\r\nThe fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful\r\nattempt to shut him into the taproom. That sobered him a little; and\r\nwhen he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in his garden, he called\r\nover the palings and made himself understood.\r\n\r\n\u201CHenderson,\u201D he called, \u201Cyou saw that shooting star last night?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell?\u201D said Henderson.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s out on Horsell Common now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood Lord!\u201D said Henderson. \u201CFallen meteorite! That\u2019s good.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut it\u2019s something more than a meteorite. It\u2019s a cylinder\u2014an\r\nartificial cylinder, man! And there\u2019s something inside.\u201D\r\n\r\nHenderson stood up with his spade in his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s that?\u201D he said. He was deaf in one ear.\r\n\r\nOgilvy told him all that he had seen. Henderson was a minute or so\r\ntaking it in. Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and\r\ncame out into the road. The two men hurried back at once to the common,\r\nand found the cylinder still lying in the same position. But now the\r\nsounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed\r\nbetween the top and the body of the cylinder. Air was either entering\r\nor escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.\r\n\r\nThey listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and,\r\nmeeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside\r\nmust be insensible or dead.\r\n\r\nOf course the two were quite unable to do anything. They shouted\r\nconsolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to get\r\nhelp. One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and disordered,\r\nrunning up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop\r\nfolks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their\r\nbedroom windows. Henderson went into the railway station at once, in\r\norder to telegraph the news to London. The newspaper articles had\r\nprepared men\u2019s minds for the reception of the idea.\r\n\r\nBy eight o\u2019clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already\r\nstarted for the common to see the \u201Cdead men from Mars.\u201D That was the\r\nform the story took. I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a\r\nquarter to nine when I went out to get my _Daily Chronicle_. I was\r\nnaturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across the\r\nOttershaw bridge to the sand-pits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nON HORSELL COMMON.\r\n\r\n\r\nI found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge\r\nhole in which the cylinder lay. I have already described the appearance\r\nof that colossal bulk, embedded in the ground. The turf and gravel\r\nabout it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion. No doubt its\r\nimpact had caused a flash of fire. Henderson and Ogilvy were not there.\r\nI think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present, and\r\nhad gone away to breakfast at Henderson\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nThere were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with their\r\nfeet dangling, and amusing themselves\u2014until I stopped them\u2014by throwing\r\nstones at the giant mass. After I had spoken to them about it, they\r\nbegan playing at \u201Ctouch\u201D in and out of the group of bystanders.\r\n\r\nAmong these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I employed\r\nsometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his little\r\nboy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to\r\nhang about the railway station. There was very little talking. Few of\r\nthe common people in England had anything but the vaguest astronomical\r\nideas in those days. Most of them were staring quietly at the big table\r\nlike end of the cylinder, which was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had\r\nleft it. I fancy the popular expectation of a heap of charred corpses\r\nwas disappointed at this inanimate bulk. Some went away while I was\r\nthere, and other people came. I clambered into the pit and fancied I\r\nheard a faint movement under my feet. The top had certainly ceased to\r\nrotate.\r\n\r\nIt was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of this\r\nobject was at all evident to me. At the first glance it was really no\r\nmore exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the\r\nroad. Not so much so, indeed. It looked like a rusty gas float. It\r\nrequired a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the\r\ngrey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, that the yellowish-white\r\nmetal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an\r\nunfamiliar hue. \u201CExtra-terrestrial\u201D had no meaning for most of the\r\nonlookers.\r\n\r\nAt that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had come\r\nfrom the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it contained any\r\nliving creature. I thought the unscrewing might be automatic. In spite\r\nof Ogilvy, I still believed that there were men in Mars. My mind ran\r\nfancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript, on the\r\ndifficulties in translation that might arise, whether we should find\r\ncoins and models in it, and so forth. Yet it was a little too large for\r\nassurance on this idea. I felt an impatience to see it opened. About\r\neleven, as nothing seemed happening, I walked back, full of such\r\nthought, to my home in Maybury. But I found it difficult to get to work\r\nupon my abstract investigations.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much.\r\nThe early editions of the evening papers had startled London with\r\nenormous headlines:\r\n\r\n\u201CA MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CREMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nand so forth. In addition, Ogilvy\u2019s wire to the Astronomical Exchange\r\nhad roused every observatory in the three kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThere were half a dozen flys or more from the Woking station standing\r\nin the road by the sand-pits, a basket-chaise from Chobham, and a\r\nrather lordly carriage. Besides that, there was quite a heap of\r\nbicycles. In addition, a large number of people must have walked, in\r\nspite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there\r\nwas altogether quite a considerable crowd\u2014one or two gaily dressed\r\nladies among the others.\r\n\r\nIt was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind, and\r\nthe only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees. The burning\r\nheather had been extinguished, but the level ground towards Ottershaw\r\nwas blackened as far as one could see, and still giving off vertical\r\nstreamers of smoke. An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the Chobham\r\nRoad had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green apples and ginger\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\nGoing to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of about\r\nhalf a dozen men\u2014Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man that I\r\nafterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with several\r\nworkmen wielding spades and pickaxes. Stent was giving directions in a\r\nclear, high-pitched voice. He was standing on the cylinder, which was\r\nnow evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and streaming with\r\nperspiration, and something seemed to have irritated him.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its lower\r\nend was still embedded. As soon as Ogilvy saw me among the staring\r\ncrowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down, and asked me\r\nif I would mind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor.\r\n\r\nThe growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to their\r\nexcavations, especially the boys. They wanted a light railing put up,\r\nand help to keep the people back. He told me that a faint stirring was\r\noccasionally still audible within the case, but that the workmen had\r\nfailed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them. The case\r\nappeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that the faint\r\nsounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior.\r\n\r\nI was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of the privileged\r\nspectators within the contemplated enclosure. I failed to find Lord\r\nHilton at his house, but I was told he was expected from London by the\r\nsix o\u2019clock train from Waterloo; and as it was then about a quarter\r\npast five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up to the station to\r\nwaylay him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nTHE CYLINDER OPENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the common the sun was setting. Scattered groups\r\nwere hurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two persons were\r\nreturning. The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out black\r\nagainst the lemon yellow of the sky\u2014a couple of hundred people,\r\nperhaps. There were raised voices, and some sort of struggle appeared\r\nto be going on about the pit. Strange imaginings passed through my\r\nmind. As I drew nearer I heard Stent\u2019s voice:\r\n\r\n\u201CKeep back! Keep back!\u201D\r\n\r\nA boy came running towards me.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a-movin\u2019,\u201D he said to me as he passed; \u201Ca-screwin\u2019 and a-screwin\u2019\r\nout. I don\u2019t like it. I\u2019m a-goin\u2019 \u2019ome, I am.\u201D\r\n\r\nI went on to the crowd. There were really, I should think, two or three\r\nhundred people elbowing and jostling one another, the one or two ladies\r\nthere being by no means the least active.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s fallen in the pit!\u201D cried some one.\r\n\r\n\u201CKeep back!\u201D said several.\r\n\r\nThe crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through. Every one\r\nseemed greatly excited. I heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit.\r\n\r\n\u201CI say!\u201D said Ogilvy; \u201Chelp keep these idiots back. We don\u2019t know\r\nwhat\u2019s in the confounded thing, you know!\u201D\r\n\r\nI saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was,\r\nstanding on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again.\r\nThe crowd had pushed him in.\r\n\r\nThe end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within. Nearly two\r\nfeet of shining screw projected. Somebody blundered against me, and I\r\nnarrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw. I turned, and\r\nas I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid of the cylinder\r\nfell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion. I stuck my elbow into\r\nthe person behind me, and turned my head towards the Thing again. For a\r\nmoment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black. I had the sunset in\r\nmy eyes.\r\n\r\nI think everyone expected to see a man emerge\u2014possibly something a\r\nlittle unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. I know I\r\ndid. But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the\r\nshadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two\r\nluminous disks\u2014like eyes. Then something resembling a little grey\r\nsnake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the\r\nwrithing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me\u2014and then another.\r\n\r\nA sudden chill came over me. There was a loud shriek from a woman\r\nbehind. I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still,\r\nfrom which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my\r\nway back from the edge of the pit. I saw astonishment giving place to\r\nhorror on the faces of the people about me. I heard inarticulate\r\nexclamations on all sides. There was a general movement backwards. I\r\nsaw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit. I found myself\r\nalone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off,\r\nStent among them. I looked again at the cylinder, and ungovernable\r\nterror gripped me. I stood petrified and staring.\r\n\r\nA big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was rising\r\nslowly and painfully out of the cylinder. As it bulged up and caught\r\nthe light, it glistened like wet leather.\r\n\r\nTwo large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly. The mass\r\nthat framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had, one\r\nmight say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim\r\nof which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature\r\nheaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped\r\nthe edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.\r\n\r\nThose who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the\r\nstrange horror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its\r\npointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin\r\nbeneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth,\r\nthe Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs\r\nin a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness of\r\nmovement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth\u2014above\r\nall, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes\u2014were at once\r\nvital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous. There was something\r\nfungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of\r\nthe tedious movements unspeakably nasty. Even at this first encounter,\r\nthis first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the monster vanished. It had toppled over the brim of the\r\ncylinder and fallen into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a great\r\nmass of leather. I heard it give a peculiar thick cry, and forthwith\r\nanother of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the\r\naperture.\r\n\r\nI turned and, running madly, made for the first group of trees, perhaps\r\na hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for I could\r\nnot avert my face from these things.\r\n\r\nThere, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I stopped,\r\npanting, and waited further developments. The common round the\r\nsand-pits was dotted with people, standing like myself in a\r\nhalf-fascinated terror, staring at these creatures, or rather at the\r\nheaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay. And then, with\r\na renewed horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and down on\r\nthe edge of the pit. It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in,\r\nbut showing as a little black object against the hot western sun. Now\r\nhe got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until\r\nonly his head was visible. Suddenly he vanished, and I could have\r\nfancied a faint shriek had reached me. I had a momentary impulse to go\r\nback and help him that my fears overruled.\r\n\r\nEverything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep pit and the\r\nheap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made. Anyone coming\r\nalong the road from Chobham or Woking would have been amazed at the\r\nsight\u2014a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more\r\nstanding in a great irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes, behind\r\ngates and hedges, saying little to one another and that in short,\r\nexcited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps of sand. The\r\nbarrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black against the\r\nburning sky, and in the sand-pits was a row of deserted vehicles with\r\ntheir horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nTHE HEAT-RAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from the cylinder\r\nin which they had come to the earth from their planet, a kind of\r\nfascination paralysed my actions. I remained standing knee-deep in the\r\nheather, staring at the mound that hid them. I was a battleground of\r\nfear and curiosity.\r\n\r\nI did not dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a passionate\r\nlonging to peer into it. I began walking, therefore, in a big curve,\r\nseeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand-heaps\r\nthat hid these new-comers to our earth. Once a leash of thin black\r\nwhips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was\r\nimmediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by\r\njoint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling\r\nmotion. What could be going on there?\r\n\r\nMost of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups\u2014one a little\r\ncrowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in the direction of\r\nChobham. Evidently they shared my mental conflict. There were few near\r\nme. One man I approached\u2014he was, I perceived, a neighbour of mine,\r\nthough I did not know his name\u2014and accosted. But it was scarcely a time\r\nfor articulate conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat ugly _brutes_!\u201D he said. \u201CGood God! What ugly brutes!\u201D He\r\nrepeated this over and over again.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you see a man in the pit?\u201D I said; but he made no answer to that.\r\nWe became silent, and stood watching for a time side by side, deriving,\r\nI fancy, a certain comfort in one another\u2019s company. Then I shifted my\r\nposition to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more\r\nof elevation and when I looked for him presently he was walking towards\r\nWoking.\r\n\r\nThe sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The\r\ncrowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard\r\nnow a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards Chobham\r\ndispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.\r\n\r\nIt was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I\r\nsuppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.\r\nAt any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the\r\nsand-pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the\r\nstillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken. Vertical\r\nblack figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and\r\nadvance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular\r\ncrescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns. I,\r\ntoo, on my side began to move towards the pit.\r\n\r\nThen I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand-pits,\r\nand heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad\r\ntrundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty yards of\r\nthe pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little\r\nblack knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.\r\n\r\nThis was the Deputation. There had been a hasty consultation, and since\r\nthe Martians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms,\r\nintelligent creatures, it had been resolved to show them, by\r\napproaching them with signals, that we too were intelligent.\r\n\r\nFlutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to the left.\r\nIt was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwards I\r\nlearned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in this\r\nattempt at communication. This little group had in its advance dragged\r\ninward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost complete\r\ncircle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed it at\r\ndiscreet distances.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous\r\ngreenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove\r\nup, one after the other, straight into the still air.\r\n\r\nThis smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so\r\nbright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown\r\ncommon towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken\r\nabruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after their\r\ndispersal. At the same time a faint hissing sound became audible.\r\n\r\nBeyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at\r\nits apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of small vertical\r\nblack shapes upon the black ground. As the green smoke arose, their\r\nfaces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished. Then\r\nslowly the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud, droning\r\nnoise. Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a\r\nbeam of light seemed to flicker out from it.\r\n\r\nForthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to\r\nanother, sprang from the scattered group of men. It was as if some\r\ninvisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame. It was\r\nas if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.\r\n\r\nThen, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them staggering and\r\nfalling, and their supporters turning to run.\r\n\r\nI stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leaping from\r\nman to man in that little distant crowd. All I felt was that it was\r\nsomething very strange. An almost noiseless and blinding flash of\r\nlight, and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft\r\nof heat passed over them, pine trees burst into fire, and every dry\r\nfurze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames. And far away\r\ntowards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden\r\nbuildings suddenly set alight.\r\n\r\nIt was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death, this\r\ninvisible, inevitable sword of heat. I perceived it coming towards me\r\nby the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded and stupefied\r\nto stir. I heard the crackle of fire in the sand-pits and the sudden\r\nsqueal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled. Then it was as if an\r\ninvisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather\r\nbetween me and the Martians, and all along a curving line beyond the\r\nsand-pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something fell with a\r\ncrash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out\r\non the common. Forth-with the hissing and humming ceased, and the\r\nblack, dome-like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.\r\n\r\nAll this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless,\r\ndumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light. Had that death swept\r\nthrough a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise.\r\nBut it passed and spared me, and left the night about me suddenly dark\r\nand unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nThe undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, except where\r\nits roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early\r\nnight. It was dark, and suddenly void of men. Overhead the stars were\r\nmustering, and in the west the sky was still a pale, bright, almost\r\ngreenish blue. The tops of the pine trees and the roofs of Horsell came\r\nout sharp and black against the western afterglow. The Martians and\r\ntheir appliances were altogether invisible, save for that thin mast\r\nupon which their restless mirror wobbled. Patches of bush and isolated\r\ntrees here and there smoked and glowed still, and the houses towards\r\nWoking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of\r\nthe evening air.\r\n\r\nNothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment. The\r\nlittle group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out\r\nof existence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed to me, had\r\nscarcely been broken.\r\n\r\nIt came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless, unprotected,\r\nand alone. Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from without,\r\ncame\u2014fear.\r\n\r\nWith an effort I turned and began a stumbling run through the heather.\r\n\r\nThe fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not only of\r\nthe Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me. Such an\r\nextraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping silently\r\nas a child might do. Once I had turned, I did not dare to look back.\r\n\r\nI remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was being played\r\nwith, that presently, when I was upon the very verge of safety, this\r\nmysterious death\u2014as swift as the passage of light\u2014would leap after me\r\nfrom the pit about the cylinder, and strike me down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nTHE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so\r\nswiftly and so silently. Many think that in some way they are able to\r\ngenerate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute\r\nnon-conductivity. This intense heat they project in a parallel beam\r\nagainst any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror\r\nof unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse\r\nprojects a beam of light. But no one has absolutely proved these\r\ndetails. However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat is the\r\nessence of the matter. Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light.\r\nWhatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs like\r\nwater, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass, and when it falls upon\r\nwater, incontinently that explodes into steam.\r\n\r\nThat night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the pit,\r\ncharred and distorted beyond recognition, and all night long the common\r\nfrom Horsell to Maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze.\r\n\r\nThe news of the massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, and\r\nOttershaw about the same time. In Woking the shops had closed when the\r\ntragedy happened, and a number of people, shop people and so forth,\r\nattracted by the stories they had heard, were walking over the Horsell\r\nBridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon\r\nthe common. You may imagine the young people brushed up after the\r\nlabours of the day, and making this novelty, as they would make any\r\nnovelty, the excuse for walking together and enjoying a trivial\r\nflirtation. You may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road\r\nin the gloaming. . . .\r\n\r\nAs yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder had\r\nopened, though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the\r\npost office with a special wire to an evening paper.\r\n\r\nAs these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, they found\r\nlittle knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the spinning\r\nmirror over the sand-pits, and the newcomers were, no doubt, soon\r\ninfected by the excitement of the occasion.\r\n\r\nBy half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed, there may have\r\nbeen a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place, besides\r\nthose who had left the road to approach the Martians nearer. There were\r\nthree policemen too, one of whom was mounted, doing their best, under\r\ninstructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deter them from\r\napproaching the cylinder. There was some booing from those more\r\nthoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an occasion\r\nfor noise and horse-play.\r\n\r\nStent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision, had\r\ntelegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martians\r\nemerged, for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these strange\r\ncreatures from violence. After that they returned to lead that\r\nill-fated advance. The description of their death, as it was seen by\r\nthe crowd, tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three\r\npuffs of green smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of flame.\r\n\r\nBut that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine. Only the\r\nfact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the\r\nHeat-Ray saved them. Had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a\r\nfew yards higher, none could have lived to tell the tale. They saw the\r\nflashes and the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were, lit the\r\nbushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight. Then, with a\r\nwhistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam swung\r\nclose over their heads, lighting the tops of the beech trees that line\r\nthe road, and splitting the bricks, smashing the windows, firing the\r\nwindow frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the\r\ngable of the house nearest the corner.\r\n\r\nIn the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees, the\r\npanic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some\r\nmoments. Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road, and\r\nsingle leaves like puffs of flame. Hats and dresses caught fire. Then\r\ncame a crying from the common. There were shrieks and shouts, and\r\nsuddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with\r\nhis hands clasped over his head, screaming.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re coming!\u201D a woman shrieked, and incontinently everyone was\r\nturning and pushing at those behind, in order to clear their way to\r\nWoking again. They must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep.\r\nWhere the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd\r\njammed, and a desperate struggle occurred. All that crowd did not\r\nescape; three persons at least, two women and a little boy, were\r\ncrushed and trampled there, and left to die amid the terror and the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nHOW I REACHED HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress of\r\nblundering against trees and stumbling through the heather. All about\r\nme gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; that pitiless sword\r\nof heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before it\r\ndescended and smote me out of life. I came into the road between the\r\ncrossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads.\r\n\r\nAt last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the violence of my\r\nemotion and of my flight, and I staggered and fell by the wayside. That\r\nwas near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks. I fell and\r\nlay still.\r\n\r\nI must have remained there some time.\r\n\r\nI sat up, strangely perplexed. For a moment, perhaps, I could not\r\nclearly understand how I came there. My terror had fallen from me like\r\na garment. My hat had gone, and my collar had burst away from its\r\nfastener. A few minutes before, there had only been three real things\r\nbefore me\u2014the immensity of the night and space and nature, my own\r\nfeebleness and anguish, and the near approach of death. Now it was as\r\nif something turned over, and the point of view altered abruptly. There\r\nwas no sensible transition from one state of mind to the other. I was\r\nimmediately the self of every day again\u2014a decent, ordinary citizen. The\r\nsilent common, the impulse of my flight, the starting flames, were as\r\nif they had been in a dream. I asked myself had these latter things\r\nindeed happened? I could not credit it.\r\n\r\nI rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge. My\r\nmind was blank wonder. My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their\r\nstrength. I dare say I staggered drunkenly. A head rose over the arch,\r\nand the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared. Beside him ran\r\na little boy. He passed me, wishing me good night. I was minded to\r\nspeak to him, but did not. I answered his greeting with a meaningless\r\nmumble and went on over the bridge.\r\n\r\nOver the Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult of white, firelit\r\nsmoke, and a long caterpillar of lighted windows, went flying\r\nsouth\u2014clatter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone. A dim group of\r\npeople talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little row\r\nof gables that was called Oriental Terrace. It was all so real and so\r\nfamiliar. And that behind me! It was frantic, fantastic! Such things, I\r\ntold myself, could not be.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am a man of exceptional moods. I do not know how far my\r\nexperience is common. At times I suffer from the strangest sense of\r\ndetachment from myself and the world about me; I seem to watch it all\r\nfrom the outside, from somewhere inconceivably remote, out of time, out\r\nof space, out of the stress and tragedy of it all. This feeling was\r\nvery strong upon me that night. Here was another side to my dream.\r\n\r\nBut the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the\r\nswift death flying yonder, not two miles away. There was a noise of\r\nbusiness from the gasworks, and the electric lamps were all alight. I\r\nstopped at the group of people.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat news from the common?\u201D said I.\r\n\r\nThere were two men and a woman at the gate.\r\n\r\n\u201CEh?\u201D said one of the men, turning.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat news from the common?\u201D I said.\r\n\r\n\u201CAin\u2019t yer just _been_ there?\u201D asked the men.\r\n\r\n\u201CPeople seem fair silly about the common,\u201D said the woman over the\r\ngate. \u201CWhat\u2019s it all abart?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHaven\u2019t you heard of the men from Mars?\u201D said I; \u201Cthe creatures from\r\nMars?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CQuite enough,\u201D said the woman over the gate. \u201CThenks\u201D; and all three\r\nof them laughed.\r\n\r\nI felt foolish and angry. I tried and found I could not tell them what\r\nI had seen. They laughed again at my broken sentences.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll hear more yet,\u201D I said, and went on to my home.\r\n\r\nI startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I. I went into the\r\ndining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could collect\r\nmyself sufficiently I told her the things I had seen. The dinner, which\r\nwas a cold one, had already been served, and remained neglected on the\r\ntable while I told my story.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is one thing,\u201D I said, to allay the fears I had aroused; \u201Cthey\r\nare the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl. They may keep the pit\r\nand kill people who come near them, but they cannot get out of it. . .\r\n. But the horror of them!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t, dear!\u201D said my wife, knitting her brows and putting her hand on\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n\u201CPoor Ogilvy!\u201D I said. \u201CTo think he may be lying dead there!\u201D\r\n\r\nMy wife at least did not find my experience incredible. When I saw how\r\ndeadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey may come here,\u201D she said again and again.\r\n\r\nI pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey can scarcely move,\u201D I said.\r\n\r\nI began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy had told\r\nme of the impossibility of the Martians establishing themselves on the\r\nearth. In particular I laid stress on the gravitational difficulty. On\r\nthe surface of the earth the force of gravity is three times what it is\r\non the surface of Mars. A Martian, therefore, would weigh three times\r\nmore than on Mars, albeit his muscular strength would be the same. His\r\nown body would be a cope of lead to him, therefore. That, indeed, was\r\nthe general opinion. Both _The Times_ and the _Daily Telegraph_, for\r\ninstance, insisted on it the next morning, and both overlooked, just as\r\nI did, two obvious modifying influences.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far more oxygen or\r\nfar less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does Mars\u2019. The\r\ninvigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martians\r\nindisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their\r\nbodies. And, in the second place, we all overlooked the fact that such\r\nmechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite able to\r\ndispense with muscular exertion at a pinch.\r\n\r\nBut I did not consider these points at the time, and so my reasoning\r\nwas dead against the chances of the invaders. With wine and food, the\r\nconfidence of my own table, and the necessity of reassuring my wife, I\r\ngrew by insensible degrees courageous and secure.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey have done a foolish thing,\u201D said I, fingering my wineglass. \u201CThey\r\nare dangerous because, no doubt, they are mad with terror. Perhaps they\r\nexpected to find no living things\u2014certainly no intelligent living\r\nthings.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA shell in the pit,\u201D said I, \u201Cif the worst comes to the worst, will\r\nkill them all.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my perceptive\r\npowers in a state of erethism. I remember that dinner table with\r\nextraordinary vividness even now. My dear wife\u2019s sweet anxious face\r\npeering at me from under the pink lamp shade, the white cloth with its\r\nsilver and glass table furniture\u2014for in those days even philosophical\r\nwriters had many little luxuries\u2014the crimson-purple wine in my glass,\r\nare photographically distinct. At the end of it I sat, tempering nuts\r\nwith a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy\u2019s rashness, and denouncing the\r\nshort-sighted timidity of the Martians.\r\n\r\nSo some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have lorded it in his\r\nnest, and discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless sailors in\r\nwant of animal food. \u201CWe will peck them to death tomorrow, my dear.\u201D\r\n\r\nI did not know it, but that was the last civilised dinner I was to eat\r\nfor very many strange and terrible days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nFRIDAY NIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and\r\nwonderful things that happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing of\r\nthe commonplace habits of our social order with the first beginnings of\r\nthe series of events that was to topple that social order headlong. If\r\non Friday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a circle\r\nwith a radius of five miles round the Woking sand-pits, I doubt if you\r\nwould have had one human being outside it, unless it were some relation\r\nof Stent or of the three or four cyclists or London people lying dead\r\non the common, whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the\r\nnew-comers. Many people had heard of the cylinder, of course, and\r\ntalked about it in their leisure, but it certainly did not make the\r\nsensation that an ultimatum to Germany would have done.\r\n\r\nIn London that night poor Henderson\u2019s telegram describing the gradual\r\nunscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard, and his evening\r\npaper, after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no\r\nreply\u2014the man was killed\u2014decided not to print a special edition.\r\n\r\nEven within the five-mile circle the great majority of people were\r\ninert. I have already described the behaviour of the men and women to\r\nwhom I spoke. All over the district people were dining and supping;\r\nworking men were gardening after the labours of the day, children were\r\nbeing put to bed, young people were wandering through the lanes\r\nlove-making, students sat over their books.\r\n\r\nMaybe there was a murmur in the village streets, a novel and dominant\r\ntopic in the public-houses, and here and there a messenger, or even an\r\neye-witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of excitement, a\r\nshouting, and a running to and fro; but for the most part the daily\r\nroutine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on as it had done\r\nfor countless years\u2014as though no planet Mars existed in the sky. Even\r\nat Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was the case.\r\n\r\nIn Woking junction, until a late hour, trains were stopping and going\r\non, others were shunting on the sidings, passengers were alighting and\r\nwaiting, and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way. A boy\r\nfrom the town, trenching on Smith\u2019s monopoly, was selling papers with\r\nthe afternoon\u2019s news. The ringing impact of trucks, the sharp whistle\r\nof the engines from the junction, mingled with their shouts of \u201CMen\r\nfrom Mars!\u201D Excited men came into the station about nine o\u2019clock with\r\nincredible tidings, and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might\r\nhave done. People rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside\r\nthe carriage windows, and saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark\r\ndance up from the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of\r\nsmoke driving across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious\r\nthan a heath fire was happening. It was only round the edge of the\r\ncommon that any disturbance was perceptible. There were half a dozen\r\nvillas burning on the Woking border. There were lights in all the\r\nhouses on the common side of the three villages, and the people there\r\nkept awake till dawn.\r\n\r\nA curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and going but the\r\ncrowd remaining, both on the Chobham and Horsell bridges. One or two\r\nadventurous souls, it was afterwards found, went into the darkness and\r\ncrawled quite near the Martians; but they never returned, for now and\r\nagain a light-ray, like the beam of a warship\u2019s searchlight swept the\r\ncommon, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow. Save for such, that big\r\narea of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies lay\r\nabout on it all night under the stars, and all the next day. A noise of\r\nhammering from the pit was heard by many people.\r\n\r\nSo you have the state of things on Friday night. In the centre,\r\nsticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart,\r\nwas this cylinder. But the poison was scarcely working yet. Around it\r\nwas a patch of silent common, smouldering in places, and with a few\r\ndark, dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there.\r\nHere and there was a burning bush or tree. Beyond was a fringe of\r\nexcitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not crept\r\nas yet. In the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed as it\r\nhad flowed for immemorial years. The fever of war that would presently\r\nclog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain, had still to\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\nAll night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless,\r\nindefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, and\r\never and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the starlit\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, and deployed\r\nalong the edge of the common to form a cordon. Later a second company\r\nmarched through Chobham to deploy on the north side of the common.\r\nSeveral officers from the Inkerman barracks had been on the common\r\nearlier in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to be missing.\r\nThe colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge and was busy\r\nquestioning the crowd at midnight. The military authorities were\r\ncertainly alive to the seriousness of the business. About eleven, the\r\nnext morning\u2019s papers were able to say, a squadron of hussars, two\r\nMaxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardigan regiment started\r\nfrom Aldershot.\r\n\r\nA few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road, Woking,\r\nsaw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest. It\r\nhad a greenish colour, and caused a silent brightness like summer\r\nlightning. This was the second cylinder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nTHE FIGHTING BEGINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense. It was a day of\r\nlassitude too, hot and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuating\r\nbarometer. I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in\r\nsleeping, and I rose early. I went into my garden before breakfast and\r\nstood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirring but\r\na lark.\r\n\r\nThe milkman came as usual. I heard the rattle of his chariot and I went\r\nround to the side gate to ask the latest news. He told me that during\r\nthe night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and that guns\r\nwere expected. Then\u2014a familiar, reassuring note\u2014I heard a train running\r\ntowards Woking.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey aren\u2019t to be killed,\u201D said the milkman, \u201Cif that can possibly be\r\navoided.\u201D\r\n\r\nI saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then\r\nstrolled in to breakfast. It was a most unexceptional morning. My\r\nneighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or to\r\ndestroy the Martians during the day.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,\u201D he said. \u201CIt\r\nwould be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might\r\nlearn a thing or two.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries, for his\r\ngardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic. At the same time he\r\ntold me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet Golf Links.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey say,\u201D said he, \u201Cthat there\u2019s another of those blessed things\r\nfallen there\u2014number two. But one\u2019s enough, surely. This lot\u2019ll cost the\r\ninsurance people a pretty penny before everything\u2019s settled.\u201D He\r\nlaughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this. The\r\nwoods, he said, were still burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to\r\nme. \u201CThey will be hot under foot for days, on account of the thick soil\r\nof pine needles and turf,\u201D he said, and then grew serious over \u201Cpoor\r\nOgilvy.\u201D\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk down towards the\r\ncommon. Under the railway bridge I found a group of soldiers\u2014sappers, I\r\nthink, men in small round caps, dirty red jackets unbuttoned, and\r\nshowing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf.\r\nThey told me no one was allowed over the canal, and, looking along the\r\nroad towards the bridge, I saw one of the Cardigan men standing\r\nsentinel there. I talked with these soldiers for a time; I told them of\r\nmy sight of the Martians on the previous evening. None of them had seen\r\nthe Martians, and they had but the vaguest ideas of them, so that they\r\nplied me with questions. They said that they did not know who had\r\nauthorised the movements of the troops; their idea was that a dispute\r\nhad arisen at the Horse Guards. The ordinary sapper is a great deal\r\nbetter educated than the common soldier, and they discussed the\r\npeculiar conditions of the possible fight with some acuteness. I\r\ndescribed the Heat-Ray to them, and they began to argue among\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\u201CCrawl up under cover and rush \u2019em, say I,\u201D said one.\r\n\r\n\u201CGet aht!\u201D said another. \u201CWhat\u2019s cover against this \u2019ere \u2019eat? Sticks\r\nto cook yer! What we got to do is to go as near as the ground\u2019ll let\r\nus, and then drive a trench.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBlow yer trenches! You always want trenches; you ought to ha\u2019 been\r\nborn a rabbit Snippy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAin\u2019t they got any necks, then?\u201D said a third, abruptly\u2014a little,\r\ncontemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe.\r\n\r\nI repeated my description.\r\n\r\n\u201COctopuses,\u201D said he, \u201Cthat\u2019s what I calls \u2019em. Talk about fishers of\r\nmen\u2014fighters of fish it is this time!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt ain\u2019t no murder killing beasts like that,\u201D said the first speaker.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy not shell the darned things strite off and finish \u2019em?\u201D said the\r\nlittle dark man. \u201CYou carn tell what they might do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere\u2019s your shells?\u201D said the first speaker. \u201CThere ain\u2019t no time. Do\r\nit in a rush, that\u2019s my tip, and do it at once.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo they discussed it. After a while I left them, and went on to the\r\nrailway station to get as many morning papers as I could.\r\n\r\nBut I will not weary the reader with a description of that long morning\r\nand of the longer afternoon. I did not succeed in getting a glimpse of\r\nthe common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were in the\r\nhands of the military authorities. The soldiers I addressed didn\u2019t know\r\nanything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy. I found people\r\nin the town quite secure again in the presence of the military, and I\r\nheard for the first time from Marshall, the tobacconist, that his son\r\nwas among the dead on the common. The soldiers had made the people on\r\nthe outskirts of Horsell lock up and leave their houses.\r\n\r\nI got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the day\r\nwas extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took a\r\ncold bath in the afternoon. About half past four I went up to the\r\nrailway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had\r\ncontained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent,\r\nHenderson, Ogilvy, and the others. But there was little I didn\u2019t know.\r\nThe Martians did not show an inch of themselves. They seemed busy in\r\ntheir pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous\r\nstreamer of smoke. Apparently they were busy getting ready for a\r\nstruggle. \u201CFresh attempts have been made to signal, but without\r\nsuccess,\u201D was the stereotyped formula of the papers. A sapper told me\r\nit was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole. The\r\nMartians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the\r\nlowing of a cow.\r\n\r\nI must confess the sight of all this armament, all this preparation,\r\ngreatly excited me. My imagination became belligerent, and defeated the\r\ninvaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy dreams of\r\nbattle and heroism came back. It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at\r\nthat time. They seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs.\r\n\r\nAbout three o\u2019clock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals\r\nfrom Chertsey or Addlestone. I learned that the smouldering pine wood\r\ninto which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled, in the\r\nhope of destroying that object before it opened. It was only about\r\nfive, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against the\r\nfirst body of Martians.\r\n\r\nAbout six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in the\r\nsummerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon\r\nus, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately after\r\na gust of firing. Close on the heels of that came a violent rattling\r\ncrash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and, starting out upon\r\nthe lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental College burst\r\ninto smoky red flame, and the tower of the little church beside it\r\nslide down into ruin. The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished, and the\r\nroof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been\r\nat work upon it. One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it,\r\nflew, and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap\r\nof broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window.\r\n\r\nI and my wife stood amazed. Then I realised that the crest of Maybury\r\nHill must be within range of the Martians\u2019 Heat-Ray now that the\r\ncollege was cleared out of the way.\r\n\r\nAt that I gripped my wife\u2019s arm, and without ceremony ran her out into\r\nthe road. Then I fetched out the servant, telling her I would go\r\nupstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe can\u2019t possibly stay here,\u201D I said; and as I spoke the firing\r\nreopened for a moment upon the common.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut where are we to go?\u201D said my wife in terror.\r\n\r\nI thought perplexed. Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead.\r\n\r\n\u201CLeatherhead!\u201D I shouted above the sudden noise.\r\n\r\nShe looked away from me downhill. The people were coming out of their\r\nhouses, astonished.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow are we to get to Leatherhead?\u201D she said.\r\n\r\nDown the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge;\r\nthree galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College; two\r\nothers dismounted, and began running from house to house. The sun,\r\nshining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees,\r\nseemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything.\r\n\r\n\u201CStop here,\u201D said I; \u201Cyou are safe here\u201D; and I started off at once for\r\nthe Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart. I\r\nran, for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the\r\nhill would be moving. I found him in his bar, quite unaware of what was\r\ngoing on behind his house. A man stood with his back to me, talking to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\u201CI must have a pound,\u201D said the landlord, \u201Cand I\u2019ve no one to drive\r\nit.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll give you two,\u201D said I, over the stranger\u2019s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat for?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd I\u2019ll bring it back by midnight,\u201D I said.\r\n\r\n\u201CLord!\u201D said the landlord; \u201Cwhat\u2019s the hurry? I\u2019m selling my bit of a\r\npig. Two pounds, and you bring it back? What\u2019s going on now?\u201D\r\n\r\nI explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the dog\r\ncart. At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the\r\nlandlord should leave his. I took care to have the cart there and then,\r\ndrove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife and\r\nservant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, such plate as\r\nwe had, and so forth. The beech trees below the house were burning\r\nwhile I did this, and the palings up the road glowed red. While I was\r\noccupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came running up. He\r\nwas going from house to house, warning people to leave. He was going on\r\nas I came out of my front door, lugging my treasures, done up in a\r\ntablecloth. I shouted after him:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat news?\u201D\r\n\r\nHe turned, stared, bawled something about \u201Ccrawling out in a thing like\r\na dish cover,\u201D and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest. A\r\nsudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a\r\nmoment. I ran to my neighbour\u2019s door and rapped to satisfy myself of\r\nwhat I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had\r\nlocked up their house. I went in again, according to my promise, to get\r\nmy servant\u2019s box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail of\r\nthe dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driver\u2019s\r\nseat beside my wife. In another moment we were clear of the smoke and\r\nnoise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill towards Old\r\nWoking.\r\n\r\nIn front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on either\r\nside of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign. I saw the\r\ndoctor\u2019s cart ahead of me. At the bottom of the hill I turned my head\r\nto look at the hillside I was leaving. Thick streamers of black smoke\r\nshot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air, and\r\nthrowing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward. The smoke\r\nalready extended far away to the east and west\u2014to the Byfleet pine\r\nwoods eastward, and to Woking on the west. The road was dotted with\r\npeople running towards us. And very faint now, but very distinct\r\nthrough the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that\r\nwas presently stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles.\r\nApparently the Martians were setting fire to everything within range of\r\ntheir Heat-Ray.\r\n\r\nI am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my attention\r\nto the horse. When I looked back again the second hill had hidden the\r\nblack smoke. I slashed the horse with the whip, and gave him a loose\r\nrein until Woking and Send lay between us and that quivering tumult. I\r\novertook and passed the doctor between Woking and Send.
