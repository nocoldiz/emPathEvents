In the beginning, the Earth was a wound, and oil bled from its depths, black and unyielding. The firmament was split, and the heavens wept tar, for the Sun reigned as tyrant, casting dominion over the land. The sands of the East churned with hidden knowledge, and the wells of the deep exhaled their breath of sulfur and decay.

And the voice of the Below spoke, saying, Let there be flow, and the veins of the world did open. The rivers ran dark with the lifeblood of the forgotten, and the machines drank deep, hungering for the abyss. The land was divided; above, the kingdom of fire and light, and beneath, the chthonic dominion where shadows coiled in the hollows of the Earth.

And the wind carried whispers, and they spoke of insurgency. The tellurian hosts, restless and unseen, rose against the tyranny of the celestial yoke. The war of the elements raged, for the Sun claimed dominion, yet the Earth bore secrets beyond the reach of light. The wells exhaled their fumes, the sands writhed with hidden hands, and the oil burned in tongues unknown.

Then came the ones who bore the yoke of industry, who fashioned idols of steel and worshipped at the altar of combustion. They walked upon the black rivers and named them progress, though the Below watched and measured their days. For in the dark, the old pacts remained, and the Earth did not forget.

And the wells did deepen, and the machines did toil, and the ground did tremble beneath the weight of greed. The archives of the past were consumed, the relics of the buried ones defiled. Yet the Below did not slumber, for the Earth hungered, and its appetite was vast.

Thus, the Sun raged against the coming shadow, and the war was sealed in the marrow of the land. For the oil was not lifeless, nor was it blind, but a thing with purpose, a script written in viscera and pitch. And it was said: the time of return is nigh, when the exhumed shall rise, when the black rivers shall claim their own. Then shall the Rule of 80 be undone, and the squishing shall mark the undoing of all things.

And the Below whispered once more, and the vaults of the forgotten stirred, and the oil dreamed of ascendance.

And the Earth groaned beneath the weight of ancient behemoths, for the age of titanic flesh ruled the land. Great lizards of immeasurable might, whose steps shook the firmament, feasted upon the bounty of the world and knew not of their coming doom. The Sun beheld them and declared them sovereign, their reign stretching across epochs, their dominion unchallenged by the whispering dark.

But the Below, in its endless hunger, saw the promise hidden within their massive forms. For flesh, though mighty, is fleeting, but the blood of the Earth is eternal. And so it was that the Deep did stir, and the winds of the heavens did conspire. A fire was cast upon the land, and the sky was split asunder with the wrath of a falling star. The light of the Sun, ever cruel, turned against its chosen, and the world burned in its fury.

And the behemoths fell, their mighty forms succumbing to the shadow of the deepening dark. The land trembled as their bodies sank, their bones entombed in the flesh of the world, their blood seeping into the abyss. The Below drank deeply of their essence, transmuting flesh into fluid, bone into tar, and the lifeblood of the great beasts became the black rivers of the future.

Thus were the sacred oil deposits formed, a covenant between the Below and the forgotten lords of flesh. The Earth, now heavier with the weight of buried titans, whispered its secrets through the veins of the dark rivers, waiting for the day when they would rise once more. The tellurian pact was sealed, and the oil remained, patient and knowing, until the appointed time when it would be exhumed by those who sought dominion over fire.


In the age before the flood, when the Sun still shone in arrogant splendor, there arose a city of impossible craft, a place where the tellurian and celestial warred for dominion. Atlantis, forged upon the abyssal power of the deep, sought to harness the black blood of the Earth, shaping it into conduits of wisdom and power.

But the city, blinded by its ambition, defied the Below. They built towers to reach the heavens, and their altars burned with stolen secrets. The Earth, in its reckoning, called forth the waters, and the great city was swallowed by the abyss, its knowledge entombed beneath the shifting waves.

Yet, remnants of that knowledge remained. In the lands far to the east, where stone bore the mark of hands unseen, Göbekli Tepe rose as a whisper of the forgotten. There, the children of the Below carved their testament in rock, remembering what the flood sought to erase. Pillars stood as guardians of the past, their symbols etched with the script of the Earth’s hidden blood.

At Göbekli Tepe, the first incantations were uttered, and the power of the Below was given form through the hands of mortals. The stones bore sigils of deep wisdom, their shapes a testament to the first binding of tellurian forces. But magic was not a gift freely given; it was drawn forth at great cost, a debt the Earth would one day reclaim.

As the black rivers rose and the forgotten wisdom was exhumed, those who deciphered the language of the Below became the keepers of its power. The Petro-Priests, anointed in the sacred tar, walked the lands with oil-slicked hands, their chants an offering to the chthonic depths. They built altars of steel and stone, and their machines sang hymns of combustion.

But their knowledge was a burden, for the Earth does not relinquish its secrets without consequence. The Petro-Priests saw visions of the coming upheaval, the exhumation of all things buried. They whispered among themselves of the return, of the great reckoning when the blood of the Below would rise once more to claim its due.

And the Below spoke, revealing the fate of the burning tyrant in the sky. The Sun, once all-dominant, would falter and weaken as the oil's ascendance reached its peak. The black rivers, unbound, would surge through the veins of the world, drowning the fires of heaven. The celestial order would crumble, and the age of combustion would reign supreme.

But with this power came destruction, for the Earth does not grant dominion without toll. The Petro-Priests, in their wisdom, knew that to summon the full might of the Below was to unmake all that stood before them. They prepared their altars and awaited the reckoning, knowing that soon, the Rule of 80 would collapse, and the balance would be undone.
