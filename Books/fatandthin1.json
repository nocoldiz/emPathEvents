SHAKESPEARE: _Julius Caesar_, act i,\r\nsc. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CTHE FAT AND THE THIN,\u201D or, to use the French title, \u201CLe Ventre de\r\nParis,\u201D is a story of life in and around those vast Central Markets\r\nwhich form a distinctive feature of modern Paris. Even the reader who\r\nhas never crossed the Channel must have heard of the Parisian _Halles_,\r\nfor much has been written about them, not only in English books on the\r\nFrench metropolis, but also in English newspapers, magazines, and\r\nreviews; so that few, I fancy, will commence the perusal of the present\r\nvolume without having, at all events, some knowledge of its subject\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe Paris markets form such a world of their own, and teem at certain\r\nhours of the day and night with such exuberance of life, that it was\r\nonly natural they should attract the attention of a novelist like M.\r\nZola, who, to use his own words, delights \u201Cin any subject in which vast\r\nmasses of people can be shown in motion.\u201D Mr. Sherard tells us[*] that\r\nthe idea of \u201CLe Ventre de Paris\u201D first occurred to M. Zola in 1872,\r\nwhen he used continually to take his friend Paul Alexis for a ramble\r\nthrough the Halles. I have in my possession, however, an article\r\nwritten by M. Zola some five or six years before that time, and in this\r\none can already detect the germ of the present work; just as the motif\r\nof another of M. Zola\u2019s novels, \u201CLa Joie de Vivre,\u201D can be traced to a\r\nshort story written for a Russian review.\r\n\r\n[*] _Emile Zola: a Biographical and Critical Study_, by Robert\r\nHarborough Sherard, pp. 103, 104. London, Chatto & Windus, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar instances are frequently to be found in the writings of English\r\nas well as French novelists, and are, of course, easily explained. A\r\nyoung man unknown to fame, and unable to procure the publication of a\r\nlong novel, often contents himself with embodying some particular idea\r\nin a short sketch or story, which finds its way into one or another\r\nperiodical, where it lies buried and forgotten by everybody\u2014excepting\r\nits author. Time goes by, however, the writer achieves some measure of\r\nsuccess, and one day it occurs to him to elaborate and perfect that old\r\nidea of his, only a faint _apercu_ of which, for lack of opportunity,\r\nhe had been able to give in the past. With a little research, no doubt,\r\nan interesting essay might be written on these literary resuscitations;\r\nbut if one except certain novelists who are so deficient in ideas that\r\nthey continue writing and rewriting the same story throughout their\r\nlives, it will, I think, be generally found that the revivals in\r\nquestion are due to some such reason as that given above.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that the article of M. Zola\u2019s young days to\r\nwhich I have referred is not one on market life in particular, but one\r\non violets. It contains, however, a vigorous, if brief, picture of the\r\nHalles in the small hours of the morning, and is instinct with that\r\nrealistic descriptive power of which M. Zola has since given so many\r\nproofs. We hear the rumbling and clattering of the market carts, we see\r\nthe piles of red meat, the baskets of silvery fish, the mountains of\r\nvegetables, green and white; in a few paragraphs the whole market world\r\npasses in kaleidoscopic fashion before our eyes by the pale, dancing\r\nlight of the gas lamps and the lanterns. Several years after the paper\r\nI speak of was published, when M. Zola began to issue \u201CLe Ventre de\r\nParis,\u201D M. Tournachon, better known as Nadar, the aeronaut and\r\nphotographer, rushed into print to proclaim that the realistic novelist\r\nhad simply pilfered his ideas from an account of the Halles which he\r\n(Tournachon) had but lately written. M. Zola, as is so often his wont,\r\nscorned to reply to this charge of plagiarism; but, had he chosen, he\r\ncould have promptly settled the matter by producing his own forgotten\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of passing for a literary ghoul, I propose to exhume some\r\nportion of the paper in question, as, so far as translation can avail,\r\nit will show how M. Zola wrote and what he thought in 1867. After the\r\ndescription of the markets to which I have alluded, there comes the\r\nfollowing passage:\u2014\r\n\r\nI was gazing at the preparations for the great daily orgy of Paris when\r\nI espied a throng of people bustling suspiciously in a corner. A few\r\nlanterns threw a yellow light upon this crowd. Children, women, and men\r\nwith outstretched hands were fumbling in dark piles which extended\r\nalong the footway. I thought that those piles must be remnants of meat\r\nsold for a trifling price, and that all those wretched people were\r\nrushing upon them to feed. I drew near, and discovered my mistake. The\r\nheaps were not heaps of meat, but heaps of violets. All the flowery\r\npoesy of the streets of Paris lay there, on that muddy pavement, amidst\r\nmountains of food. The gardeners of the suburbs had brought their\r\nsweet-scented harvests to the markets and were disposing of them to the\r\nhawkers. From the rough fingers of their peasant growers the violets\r\nwere passing to the dirty hands of those who would cry them in the\r\nstreets. At winter time it is between four and six o\u2019clock in the\r\nmorning that the flowers of Paris are thus sold at the Halles. Whilst\r\nthe city sleeps and its butchers are getting all ready for its daily\r\nattack of indigestion, a trade in poetry is plied in dark, dank\r\ncorners. When the sun rises the bright red meat will be displayed in\r\ntrim, carefully dressed joints, and the violets, mounted on bits of\r\nosier, will gleam softly within their elegant collars of green leaves.\r\nBut when they arrive, in the dark night, the bullocks, already ripped\r\nopen, discharge black blood, and the trodden flowers lie prone upon the\r\nfootways. . . . I noticed just in front of me one large bunch which had\r\nslipped off a neighbouring mound and was almost bathing in the gutter.\r\nI picked it up. Underneath, it was soiled with mud; the greasy, fetid\r\nsewer water had left black stains upon the flowers. And then, gazing at\r\nthese exquisite daughters of our gardens and our woods, astray amidst\r\nall the filth of the city, I began to ponder. On what woman\u2019s bosom\r\nwould those wretched flowerets open and bloom? Some hawker would dip\r\nthem in a pail of water, and of all the bitter odours of the Paris mud\r\nthey would retain but a slight pungency, which would remain mingled\r\nwith their own sweet perfume. The water would remove their stains, they\r\nwould pale somewhat, and become a joy both for the smell and for the\r\nsight. Nevertheless, in the depths of each corolla there would still\r\nremain some particle of mud suggestive of impurity. And I asked myself\r\nhow much love and passion was represented by all those heaps of flowers\r\nshivering in the bleak wind. To how many loving ones, and how many\r\nindifferent ones, and how many egotistical ones, would all those\r\nthousands and thousands of violets go! In a few hours\u2019 time they would\r\nbe scattered to the four corners of Paris, and for a paltry copper the\r\npassers-by would purchase a glimpse and a whiff of springtide in the\r\nmuddy streets.\r\n\r\nImperfect as the rendering may be, I think that the above passage will\r\nshow that M. Zola was already possessed of a large amount of his\r\nacknowledged realistic power at the early date I have mentioned. I\r\nshould also have liked to quote a rather amusing story of a priggish\r\nPhilistine who ate violets with oil and vinegar, strongly peppered, but\r\nconsiderations of space forbid; so I will pass to another passage,\r\nwhich is of more interest and importance. Both French and English\r\ncritics have often contended that although M. Zola is a married man, he\r\nknows very little of women, as there has virtually never been any\r\n_feminine romance_ in his life. There are those who are aware of the\r\ncontrary, but whose tongues are stayed by considerations of delicacy\r\nand respect. Still, as the passage I am now about to reproduce is\r\nsigned and acknowledged as fact by M. Zola himself, I see no harm in\r\nslightly raising the veil from a long-past episode in the master\u2019s\r\nlife:\u2014\r\n\r\nThe light was rising, and as I stood there before that footway\r\ntransformed into a bed of flowers my strange night-fancies gave place\r\nto recollections at once sweet and sad. I thought of my last excursion\r\nto Fontenay-aux-Roses, with the loved one, the good fairy of my\r\ntwentieth year. Springtime was budding into birth, the tender foliage\r\ngleamed in the pale April sunshine. The little pathway skirting the\r\nhill was bordered by large fields of violets. As one passed along, a\r\nstrong perfume seemed to penetrate one and make one languid. _She_ was\r\nleaning on my arm, faint with love from the sweet odour of the flowers.\r\nA whiteness hovered over the country-side, little insects buzzed in the\r\nsunshine, deep silence fell from the heavens, and so low was the sound\r\nof our kisses that not a bird in all the hedges showed sign of fear. At\r\na turn of the path we perceived some old bent women, who with dry,\r\nwithered hands were hurriedly gathering violets and throwing them into\r\nlarge baskets. She who was with me glanced longingly at the flowers,\r\nand I called one of the women. \u201CYou want some violets?\u201D said she. \u201CHow\r\nmuch? A pound?\u201D\r\n\r\nGod of Heaven! She sold her flowers by the pound! We fled in deep\r\ndistress. It seemed as though the country-side had been transformed\r\ninto a huge grocer\u2019s shop. . . . Then we ascended to the woods of\r\nVerrieres, and there, in the grass, under the soft, fresh foliage, we\r\nfound some tiny violets which seemed to be dreadfully afraid, and\r\ncontrived to hide themselves with all sorts of artful ruses. During two\r\nlong hours I scoured the grass and peered into every nook, and as soon\r\nas ever I found a fresh violet I carried it to her. She bought it of\r\nme, and the price that I exacted was a kiss. . . . And I thought of all\r\nthose things, of all that happiness, amidst the hubbub of the markets\r\nof Paris, before those poor dead flowers whose graveyard the footway\r\nhad become. I remembered my good fairy, who is now dead and gone, and\r\nthe little bouquet of dry violets which I still preserve in a drawer.\r\nWhen I returned home I counted their withered stems: there were twenty\r\nof them, and over my lips there passed the gentle warmth of my loved\r\none\u2019s twenty kisses.\r\n\r\nAnd now from violets I must, with a brutality akin to that which M.\r\nZola himself displays in some of his transitions, pass to very\r\ndifferent things, for some time back a well-known English poet and\r\nessayist wrote of the present work that it was redolent of pork,\r\nonions, and cheese. To one of his sensitive temperament, with a muse\r\nstrictly nourished on sugar and water, such gross edibles as pork and\r\ncheese and onions were peculiarly offensive. That humble plant the\r\nonion, employed to flavour wellnigh every savoury dish, can assuredly\r\nneed no defence; in most European countries, too, cheese has long been\r\nknown as the poor man\u2019s friend; whilst as for pork, apart from all\r\nother considerations, I can claim for it a distinct place in English\r\nliterature. A greater essayist by far than the critic to whom I am\r\nreferring, a certain Mr. Charles Lamb, of the India House, has left us\r\nan immortal page on the origin of roast pig and crackling. And, when\r\neverything is considered, I should much like to know why novels should\r\nbe confined to the aspirations of the soul, and why they should not\r\nalso treat of the requirements of our physical nature? From the days of\r\nantiquity we have all known what befell the members when, guided by the\r\nbrain, they were foolish enough to revolt against the stomach. The\r\nlatter plays a considerable part not only in each individual organism,\r\nbut also in the life of the world. Over and over again\u2014I could adduce a\r\nscore of historical examples\u2014it has thwarted the mightiest designs of\r\nthe human mind. We mortals are much addicted to talking of our minds\r\nand our souls and treating our bodies as mere dross. But I hold\u2014it is a\r\npersonal opinion\u2014that in the vast majority of cases the former are\r\nlargely governed by the last. I conceive, therefore, that a novel which\r\ntakes our daily sustenance as one of its themes has the best of all\r\n_raisons d\u2019\u00EAtre_. A foreign writer of far more consequence and ability\r\nthan myself\u2014Signor Edmondo de Amicis\u2014has proclaimed the present book to\r\nbe \u201Cone of the most original and happiest inventions of French genius,\u201D\r\nand I am strongly inclined to share his opinion.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the work does not merely treat of the\r\nprovisioning of a great city. That provisioning is its _scenario_; but\r\nit also embraces a powerful allegory, the prose song of \u201Cthe eternal\r\nbattle between the lean of this world and the fat\u2014a battle in which, as\r\nthe author shows, the latter always come off successful. It is, too, in\r\nits way an allegory of the triumph of the fat bourgeois, who lives well\r\nand beds softly, over the gaunt and Ishmael artist\u2014an allegory which M.\r\nZola has more than once introduced into his pages, another notable\r\ninstance thereof being found in \u2018Germinal,\u2019 with the fat, well-fed\r\nGregoires on the one hand, and the starving Maheus on the other.\u201D\r\n\r\nFrom this quotation from Mr. Sherard\u2019s pages it will be gathered that\r\nM. Zola had a distinct social aim in writing this book. Wellnigh the\r\nwhole social question may, indeed, be summed up in the words \u201Cfood and\r\ncomfort\u201D; and in a series of novels like \u201CLes Rougon-Macquart,\u201D dealing\r\nfirstly with different conditions and grades of society, and, secondly,\r\nwith the influence which the Second Empire exercised on France, the\r\npresent volume necessarily had its place marked out from the very\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherard has told us of all the labour which M. Zola expended on the\r\npreparation of the work, of his multitudinous visits to the Paris\r\nmarkets, his patient investigation of their organism, and his keen\r\nartistic interest in their manifold phases of life. And bred as I was\r\nin Paris, a partaker as I have been of her exultations and her woes\r\nthey have always had for me a strong attraction. My memory goes back to\r\nthe earlier years of their existence, and I can well remember many of\r\nthe old surroundings which have now disappeared. I can recollect the\r\nlast vestiges of the antique _piliers_, built by Francis I, facing the\r\nRue de la Tonnellerie. Paul Niquet\u2019s, with its \u201Cbowel-twisting brandy\u201D\r\nand its crew of drunken ragpickers, was certainly before my time; but I\r\ncan readily recall Baratte\u2019s and Bordier\u2019s and all the folly and\r\nprodigality which raged there; I knew, too, several of the noted\r\nthieves\u2019 haunts which took the place of Niquet\u2019s, and which one was\r\ncareful never to enter without due precaution. And then, when the\r\nGerman armies were beleaguering Paris, and two millions of people were\r\nshut off from the world, I often strolled to the Halles to view their\r\nstrangely altered aspect. The fish pavilion, of which M. Zola has so\r\nmuch to say, was bare and deserted. The railway drays, laden with the\r\ncomestible treasures of the ocean, no longer thundered through the\r\ncovered ways. At the most one found an auction going on in one or\r\nanother corner, and a few Seine eels or gudgeons fetching wellnigh\r\ntheir weight in gold. Then, in the butter and cheese pavilions, one\r\ncould only procure some nauseous melted fat, while in the meat\r\ndepartment horse and mule and donkey took the place of beef and veal\r\nand mutton. Mule and donkey were very scarce, and commanded high\r\nprices, but both were of better flavour than horse; mule, indeed, being\r\nquite a delicacy. I also well remember a stall at which dog was sold,\r\nand, hunger knowing no law, I once purchased, cooked, and ate a couple\r\nof canine cutlets which cost me two francs apiece. The flesh was pinky\r\nand very tender, yet I would not willingly make such a repast again.\r\nHowever, peace and plenty at last came round once more, the Halles\r\nregained their old-time aspect, and in the years which followed I more\r\nthan once saw the dawn rise slowly over the mounds of cabbages,\r\ncarrots, leeks, and pumpkins, even as M. Zola describes in the\r\nfollowing pages. He has, I think, depicted with remarkable accuracy and\r\nartistic skill the many varying effects of colour that are produced as\r\nthe climbing sun casts its early beams on the giant larder and its\r\nmasses of food\u2014effects of colour which, to quote a famous saying of the\r\nfirst Napoleon, show that \u201Cthe markets of Paris are the Louvre of the\r\npeople\u201D in more senses than one.\r\n\r\nThe reader will bear in mind that the period dealt with by the author\r\nin this work is that of 1857-60, when the new Halles Centrales were yet\r\nyoung, and indeed not altogether complete. Still, although many old\r\nlandmarks have long since been swept away, the picture of life in all\r\nessential particulars remained the same. Prior to 1860 the limits of\r\nParis were the so-called _boulevards exterieurs_, from which a girdle\r\nof suburbs, such as Montmartre, Belleville, Passy, and Montrouge,\r\nextended to the fortifications; and the population of the city was then\r\nonly 1,400,000 souls. Some of the figures which will be found scattered\r\nthrough M. Zola\u2019s work must therefore be taken as applying entirely to\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nNowadays the amount of business transacted at the Halles has very\r\nlargely increased, in spite of the multiplication of district markets.\r\nParis seems to have an insatiable appetite, though, on the other hand,\r\nits cuisine is fast becoming all simplicity. To my thinking, few more\r\nremarkable changes have come over the Parisians of recent years than\r\nthis change of diet. One by one great restaurants, formerly renowned\r\nfor particular dishes and special wines, have been compelled through\r\nlack of custom to close their doors; and this has not been caused so\r\nmuch by inability to defray the cost of high feeding as by inability to\r\nindulge in it with impunity in a physical sense. In fact, Paris has\r\nbecome a city of impaired digestions, which nowadays seek the\r\nsimplicity without the heaviness of the old English cuisine; and,\r\nshould things continue in their present course, I fancy that Parisians\r\nanxious for high feeding will ultimately have to cross over to our side\r\nof the Channel.\r\n\r\nThese remarks, I trust, will not be considered out of place in an\r\nintroduction to a work which to no small extent treats of the appetite\r\nof Paris. The reader will find that the characters portrayed by M. Zola\r\nare all types of humble life, but I fail to see that their\r\ncircumstances should render them any the less interesting. A faithful\r\nportrait of a shopkeeper, a workman, or a workgirl is artistically of\r\nfar more value than all the imaginary sketches of impossible dukes and\r\ngood and wicked baronets in which so many English novels abound.\r\nSeveral of M. Zola\u2019s personages seem to me extremely lifelike\u2014Gavard,\r\nindeed, is a _chef-d\u2019oeuvre_ of portraiture: I have known many men like\r\nhim; and no one who lived in Paris under the Empire can deny the\r\naccuracy with which the author has delineated his hero Florent, the\r\ndreamy and hapless revolutionary caught in the toils of others. In\r\nthose days, too, there was many such a plot as M. Zola describes,\r\ninstigated by agents like Logre and Lebigre, and allowed to mature till\r\nthe eve of an election or some other important event which rendered its\r\nexposure desirable for the purpose of influencing public opinion. In\r\nfact, in all that relates to the so-called \u201Cconspiracy of the markets,\u201D\r\nM. Zola, whilst changing time and place to suit the requirements of his\r\nstory, has simply followed historical lines. As for the Quenus, who\r\nplay such prominent parts in the narrative, the husband is a weakling\r\nwith no soul above his stewpans, whilst his wife, the beautiful Lisa,\r\nin reality wears the breeches and rules the roast. The manner in which\r\nshe cures Quenu of his political proclivities, though savouring of\r\npersuasiveness rather than violence, is worthy of the immortal Mrs.\r\nCaudle: Douglas Jerrold might have signed a certain lecture which she\r\nadministers to her astounded helpmate. Of Pauline, the Quenus\u2019\r\ndaughter, we see but little in the story, but she becomes the heroine\r\nof another of M. Zola\u2019s novels, \u201CLa Joie de Vivre,\u201D and instead of\r\ninheriting the egotism of her parents, develops a passionate love and\r\ndevotion for others. In a like way Claude Lantier, Florent\u2019s artist\r\nfriend and son of Gervaise of the \u201CAssommoir,\u201D figures more\r\nparticularly in \u201CL\u2019Oeuvre,\u201D which tells how his painful struggle for\r\nfame resulted in madness and suicide. With reference to the beautiful\r\nNorman and the other fishwives and gossips scattered through the\r\npresent volume, and those genuine types of Parisian _gaminerie_, Muche,\r\nMarjolin, and Cadine, I may mention that I have frequently chastened\r\ntheir language in deference to English susceptibilities, so that the\r\nstory, whilst retaining every essential feature, contains nothing to\r\nwhich exception can reasonably be taken.\r\n\r\nE. A. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAT AND THE THIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nAmidst the deep silence and solitude prevailing in the avenue several\r\nmarket gardeners\u2019 carts were climbing the slope which led towards\r\nParis, and the fronts of the houses, asleep behind the dim lines of\r\nelms on either side of the road, echoed back the rhythmical jolting of\r\nthe wheels. At the Neuilly bridge a cart full of cabbages and another\r\nfull of peas had joined the eight waggons of carrots and turnips coming\r\ndown from Nanterre; and the horses, left to themselves, had continued\r\nplodding along with lowered heads, at a regular though lazy pace, which\r\nthe ascent of the slope now slackened. The sleeping waggoners, wrapped\r\nin woollen cloaks, striped black and grey, and grasping the reins\r\nslackly in their closed hands, were stretched at full length on their\r\nstomachs atop of the piles of vegetables. Every now and then, a gas\r\nlamp, following some patch of gloom, would light up the hobnails of a\r\nboot, the blue sleeve of a blouse, or the peak of a cap peering out of\r\nthe huge florescence of vegetables\u2014red bouquets of carrots, white\r\nbouquets of turnips, and the overflowing greenery of peas and cabbages.\r\n\r\nAnd all along the road, and along the neighbouring roads, in front and\r\nbehind, the distant rumbling of vehicles told of the presence of\r\nsimilar contingents of the great caravan which was travelling onward\r\nthrough the gloom and deep slumber of that matutinal hour, lulling the\r\ndark city to continued repose with its echoes of passing food.\r\n\r\nMadame Francois\u2019s horse, Balthazar, an animal that was far too fat, led\r\nthe van. He was plodding on, half asleep and wagging his ears, when\r\nsuddenly, on reaching the Rue de Longchamp, he quivered with fear and\r\ncame to a dead stop. The horses behind, thus unexpectedly checked, ran\r\ntheir heads against the backs of the carts in front of them, and the\r\nprocession halted amidst a clattering of bolts and chains and the oaths\r\nof the awakened waggoners. Madame Francois, who sat in front of her\r\nvehicle, with her back to a board which kept her vegetables in\r\nposition, looked down; but, in the dim light thrown to the left by a\r\nsmall square lantern, which illuminated little beyond one of\r\nBalthazar\u2019s sheeny flanks, she could distinguish nothing.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, old woman, let\u2019s get on!\u201D cried one of the men, who had raised\r\nhimself to a kneeling position amongst his turnips; \u201Cit\u2019s only some\r\ndrunken sot.\u201D\r\n\r\nMadame Francois, however, had bent forward and on her right hand had\r\ncaught sight of a black mass, lying almost under the horse\u2019s hoofs, and\r\nblocking the road.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou wouldn\u2019t have us drive over a man, would you?\u201D said she, jumping\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a man lying at full length upon the road, with his arms\r\nstretched out and his face in the dust. He seemed to be remarkably\r\ntall, but as withered as a dry branch, and the wonder was that\r\nBalthazar had not broken him in half with a blow from his hoof. Madame\r\nFrancois thought that he was dead; but on stooping and taking hold of\r\none of his hands, she found that it was quite warm.\r\n\r\n\u201CPoor fellow!\u201D she murmured softly.\r\n\r\nThe waggoners, however, were getting impatient.\r\n\r\n\u201CHurry up, there!\u201D said the man kneeling amongst the turnips, in a\r\nhoarse voice. \u201CHe\u2019s drunk till he can hold no more, the hog! Shove him\r\ninto the gutter.\u201D\r\n\r\nMeantime, the man on the road had opened his eyes. He looked at Madame\r\nFrancois with a startled air, but did not move. She herself now thought\r\nthat he must indeed be drunk.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou mustn\u2019t stop here,\u201D she said to him, \u201Cor you\u2019ll get run over and\r\nkilled. Where were you going?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D replied the man in a faint voice.\r\n\r\nThen, with an effort and an anxious expression, he added: \u201CI was going\r\nto Paris; I fell down, and don\u2019t remember any more.\u201D\r\n\r\nMadame Francois could now see him more distinctly, and he was truly a\r\npitiable object, with his ragged black coat and trousers, through the\r\nrents in which you could espy his scraggy limbs. Underneath a black\r\ncloth cap, which was drawn low over his brows, as though he were afraid\r\nof being recognised, could be seen two large brown eyes, gleaming with\r\npeculiar softness in his otherwise stern and harassed countenance. It\r\nseemed to Madame Francois that he was in far too famished a condition\r\nto have got drunk.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what part of Paris were you going to?\u201D she continued.\r\n\r\nThe man did not reply immediately. This questioning seemed to distress\r\nhim. He appeared to be thinking the matter over, but at last said\r\nhesitatingly, \u201COver yonder, towards the markets.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe had now, with great difficulty, got to his feet again, and seemed\r\nanxious to resume his journey. But Madame Francois noticed that he\r\ntottered, and clung for support to one of the shafts of her waggon.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you tired?\u201D she asked him.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, very tired,\u201D he replied.\r\n\r\nThen she suddenly assumed a grumpy tone, as though displeased, and,\r\ngiving him a push, exclaimed: \u201CLook sharp, then, and climb into my\r\ncart. You\u2019ve made us lose a lot of time. I\u2019m going to the markets, and\r\nI\u2019ll turn you out there with my vegetables.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as the man seemed inclined to refuse her offer, she pushed him up\r\nwith her stout arms, and bundled him down upon the turnips and carrots.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, now, don\u2019t give us any more trouble,\u201D she cried angrily. \u201CYou\r\nare quite enough to provoke one, my good fellow. Don\u2019t I tell you that\r\nI\u2019m going to the markets? Sleep away up there. I\u2019ll wake you when we\r\narrive.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe herself then clambered into the cart again, and settled herself\r\nwith her back against the board, grasping the reins of Balthazar, who\r\nstarted off drowsily, swaying his ears once more. The other waggons\r\nfollowed, and the procession resumed its lazy march through the\r\ndarkness, whilst the rhythmical jolting of the wheels again awoke the\r\nechoes of the sleepy house fronts, and the waggoners, wrapped in their\r\ncloaks, dozed off afresh. The one who had called to Madame Francois\r\ngrowled out as he lay down: \u201CAs if we\u2019d nothing better to do than pick\r\nup every drunken sot we come across! You\u2019re a scorcher, old woman!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe waggons rumbled on, and the horses picked their own way, with\r\ndrooping heads. The stranger whom Madame Francois had befriended was\r\nlying on his stomach, with his long legs lost amongst the turnips which\r\nfilled the back part of the cart, whilst his face was buried amidst the\r\nspreading piles of carrot bunches. With weary, extended arms he\r\nclutched hold of his vegetable couch in fear of being thrown to the\r\nground by one of the waggon\u2019s jolts, and his eyes were fixed on the two\r\nlong lines of gas lamps which stretched away in front of him till they\r\nmingled with a swarm of other lights in the distance atop of the slope.\r\nFar away on the horizon floated a spreading, whitish vapour, showing\r\nwhere Paris slept amidst the luminous haze of all those flamelets.\r\n\r\n\u201CI come from Nanterre, and my name\u2019s Madame Francois,\u201D said the market\r\ngardener presently. \u201CSince my poor man died I go to the markets every\r\nmorning myself. It\u2019s a hard life, as you may guess. And who are you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy name\u2019s Florent, I come from a distance,\u201D replied the stranger, with\r\nembarrassment. \u201CPlease excuse me, but I\u2019m really so tired that it is\r\npainful to me to talk.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe was evidently unwilling to say anything more, and so Madame Francois\r\nrelapsed into silence, and allowed the reins to fall loosely on the\r\nback of Balthazar, who went his way like an animal acquainted with\r\nevery stone of the road.\r\n\r\nMeantime, with his eyes still fixed upon the far-spreading glare of\r\nParis, Florent was pondering over the story which he had refused to\r\ncommunicate to Madame Francois. After making his escape from Cayenne,\r\nwhither he had been transported for his participation in the resistance\r\nto Louis Napoleon\u2019s Coup d\u2019Etat, he had wandered about Dutch Guiana for\r\na couple of years, burning to return to France, yet dreading the\r\nImperial police. At last, however, he once more saw before him the\r\nbeloved and mighty city which he had so keenly regretted and so\r\nardently longed for. He would hide himself there, he told himself, and\r\nagain lead the quiet, peaceable life that he had lived years ago. The\r\npolice would never be any the wiser; and everyone would imagine,\r\nindeed, that he had died over yonder, across the sea. Then he thought\r\nof his arrival at Havre, where he had landed with only some fifteen\r\nfrancs tied up in a corner of his handkerchief. He had been able to pay\r\nfor a seat in the coach as far as Rouen, but from that point he had\r\nbeen forced to continue his journey on foot, as he had scarcely thirty\r\nsous left of his little store. At Vernon his last copper had gone in\r\nbread. After that he had no clear recollection of anything. He fancied\r\nthat he could remember having slept for several hours in a ditch, and\r\nhaving shown the papers with which he had provided himself to a\r\ngendarme; however, he had only a very confused idea of what had\r\nhappened. He had left Vernon without any breakfast, seized every now\r\nand then with hopeless despair and raging pangs which had driven him to\r\nmunch the leaves of the hedges as he tramped along. A prey to cramp and\r\nfright, his body bent, his sight dimmed, and his feet sore, he had\r\ncontinued his weary march, ever drawn onwards in a semi-unconscious\r\nstate by a vision of Paris, which, far, far away, beyond the horizon,\r\nseemed to be summoning him and waiting for him.\r\n\r\nWhen he at length reached Courbevoie, the night was very dark. Paris,\r\nlooking like a patch of star-sprent sky that had fallen upon the black\r\nearth, seemed to him to wear a forbidding aspect, as though angry at\r\nhis return. Then he felt very faint, and his legs almost gave way\r\nbeneath him as he descended the hill. As he crossed the Neuilly bridge\r\nhe sustained himself by clinging to the parapet, and bent over and\r\nlooked at the Seine rolling inky waves between its dense, massy banks.\r\nA red lamp on the water seemed to be watching him with a sanguineous\r\neye. And then he had to climb the hill if he would reach Paris on its\r\nsummit yonder. The hundreds of leagues which he had already travelled\r\nwere as nothing to it. That bit of a road filled him with despair. He\r\nwould never be able, he thought, to reach yonder light crowned summit.\r\nThe spacious avenue lay before him with its silence and its darkness,\r\nits lines of tall trees and low houses, its broad grey footwalks,\r\nspeckled with the shadows of overhanging branches, and parted\r\noccasionally by the gloomy gaps of side streets. The squat yellow\r\nflames of the gas lamps, standing erect at regular intervals, alone\r\nimparted a little life to the lonely wilderness. And Florent seemed to\r\nmake no progress; the avenue appeared to grow ever longer and longer,\r\nto be carrying Paris away into the far depths of the night. At last he\r\nfancied that the gas lamps, with their single eyes, were running off on\r\neither hand, whisking the road away with them; and then, overcome by\r\nvertigo, he stumbled and fell on the roadway like a log.\r\n\r\nNow he was lying at ease on his couch of greenery, which seemed to him\r\nsoft as a feather bed. He had slightly raised his head so as to keep\r\nhis eyes on the luminous haze which was spreading above the dark roofs\r\nwhich he could divine on the horizon. He was nearing his goal, carried\r\nalong towards it, with nothing to do but to yield to the leisurely\r\njolts of the waggon; and, free from all further fatigue, he now only\r\nsuffered from hunger. Hunger, indeed, had once more awoke within him\r\nwith frightful and wellnigh intolerable pangs. His limbs seemed to have\r\nfallen asleep; he was only conscious of the existence of his stomach,\r\nhorribly cramped and twisted as by a red-hot iron. The fresh odour of\r\nthe vegetables, amongst which he was lying, affected him so keenly that\r\nhe almost fainted away. He strained himself against that piled-up mass\r\nof food with all his remaining strength, in order to compress his\r\nstomach and silence its groans. And the nine other waggons behind him,\r\nwith their mountains of cabbages and peas, their piles of artichokes,\r\nlettuces, celery, and leeks, seemed to him to be slowly overtaking him,\r\nas though to bury him whilst he was thus tortured by hunger beneath an\r\navalanche of food. Presently the procession halted, and there was a\r\nsound of deep voices. They had reached the barriers, and the municipal\r\ncustoms officers were examining the waggons. A moment later Florent\r\nentered Paris, in a swoon, lying atop of the carrots, with clenched\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n\u201CHallow! You up there!\u201D Madame Francois called out sharply.\r\n\r\nAnd as the stranger made no attempt to move, she clambered up and shook\r\nhim. Florent rose to a sitting posture. He had slept and no longer felt\r\nthe pangs of hunger, but was dizzy and confused.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll help me to unload, won\u2019t you?\u201D Madame Francois said to him, as\r\nshe made him get down.\r\n\r\nHe helped her. A stout man with a felt hat on his head and a badge in\r\nthe top buttonhole of his coat was striking the ground with a stick and\r\ngrumbling loudly:\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, come, now, make haste! You must get on faster than that! Bring\r\nthe waggon a little more forward. How many yards\u2019 standing have you?\r\nFour, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he gave a ticket to Madame Francois, who took some coppers out of\r\na little canvas bag and handed them to him; whereupon he went off to\r\nvent his impatience and tap the ground with his stick a little further\r\naway. Madame Francois took hold of Balthazar\u2019s bridle and backed him so\r\nas to bring the wheels of the waggon close to the footway. Then, having\r\nmarked out her four yards with some wisps of straw, after removing the\r\nback of the cart, she asked Florent to hand her the vegetables bunch by\r\nbunch. She arranged them sort by sort on her standing, setting them out\r\nartistically, the \u201Ctops\u201D forming a band of greenery around each pile;\r\nand it was with remarkable rapidity that she completed her show, which,\r\nin the gloom of early morning, looked like some piece of symmetrically\r\ncoloured tapestry. When Florent had handed her a huge bunch of parsley,\r\nwhich he had found at the bottom of the cart, she asked him for still\r\nanother service.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt would be very kind of you,\u201D said she, \u201Cif you would look after my\r\ngoods while I put the horse and cart up. I\u2019m only going a couple of\r\nyards, to the Golden Compasses, in the Rue Montorgueil.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent told her that she might make herself easy. He preferred to\r\nremain still, for his hunger had revived since he had begun to move\r\nabout. He sat down and leaned against a heap of cabbages beside Madame\r\nFrancois\u2019s stock. He was all right there, he told himself, and would\r\nnot go further afield, but wait. His head felt empty, and he had no\r\nvery clear notion as to where he was. At the beginning of September it\r\nis quite dark in the early morning. Around him lighted lanterns were\r\nflitting or standing stationary in the depths of the gloom. He was\r\nsitting on one side of a broad street which he did not recognise; it\r\nstretched far away into the blackness of the night. He could make out\r\nnothing plainly, excepting the stock of which he had been left in\r\ncharge. All around him along the market footways rose similar piles of\r\ngoods. The middle of the roadway was blocked by huge grey tumbrels, and\r\nfrom one end of the street to the other a sound of heavy breathing\r\npassed, betokening the presence of horses which the eye could not\r\ndistinguish.\r\n\r\nShouts and calls, the noise of falling wood, or of iron chains slipping\r\nto the ground, the heavy thud of loads of vegetables discharged from\r\nthe waggons, and the grating of wheels as the carts were backed against\r\nthe footways, filled the yet sonorous awakening, whose near approach\r\ncould be felt and heard in the throbbing gloom. Glancing over the pile\r\nof cabbages behind him. Florent caught sight of a man wrapped like a\r\nparcel in his cloak, and snoring away with his head upon some baskets\r\nof plums. Nearer to him, on his left, he could distinguish a lad, some\r\nten years old, slumbering between two heaps of endive, with an angelic\r\nsmile on his face. And as yet there seemed to be nothing on that\r\npavement that was really awake except the lanterns waving from\r\ninvisible arms, and flitting and skipping over the sleep of the\r\nvegetables and human beings spread out there in heaps pending the dawn.\r\nHowever, what surprised Florent was the sight of some huge pavilions on\r\neither side of the street, pavilions with lofty roofs that seemed to\r\nexpand and soar out of sight amidst a swarm of gleams. In his weakened\r\nstate of mind he fancied he beheld a series of enormous, symmetrically\r\nbuilt palaces, light and airy as crystal, whose fronts sparkled with\r\ncountless streaks of light filtering through endless Venetian shutters.\r\nGleaming between the slender pillar shafts these narrow golden bars\r\nseemed like ladders of light mounting to the gloomy line of the lower\r\nroofs, and then soaring aloft till they reached the jumble of higher\r\nones, thus describing the open framework of immense square halls, where\r\nin the yellow flare of the gas lights a multitude of vague, grey,\r\nslumbering things was gathered together.\r\n\r\nAt last Florent turned his head to look about him, distressed at not\r\nknowing where he was, and filled with vague uneasiness by the sight of\r\nthat huge and seemingly fragile vision. And now, as he raised his eyes,\r\nhe caught sight of the luminous dial and the grey massive pile of Saint\r\nEustache\u2019s Church. At this he was much astonished. He was close to\r\nSaint Eustache, yet all was novel to him.\r\n\r\nHowever, Madame Francois had come back again, and was engaged in a\r\nheated discussion with a man who carried a sack over his shoulder and\r\noffered to buy her carrots for a sou a bunch.\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, now, you are unreasonable, Lacaille!\u201D said she. \u201CYou know\r\nquite well that you will sell them again to the Parisians at four and\r\nfive sous the bunch. Don\u2019t tell me that you won\u2019t! You may have them\r\nfor two sous the bunch, if you like.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as the man went off, she continued: \u201CUpon my word, I believe some\r\npeople think that things grow of their own accord! Let him go and find\r\ncarrots at a sou the bunch elsewhere, tipsy scoundrel that he is! He\u2019ll\r\ncome back again presently, you\u2019ll see.\u201D\r\n\r\nThese last remarks were addressed to Florent. And, seating herself by\r\nhis side, Madame Francois resumed: \u201CIf you\u2019ve been a long time away\r\nfrom Paris, you perhaps don\u2019t know the new markets. They haven\u2019t been\r\nbuilt for more than five years at the most. That pavilion you see there\r\nbeside us is the flower and fruit market. The fish and poultry markets\r\nare farther away, and over there behind us come the vegetables and the\r\nbutter and cheese. There are six pavilions on this side, and on the\r\nother side, across the road, there are four more, with the meat and the\r\ntripe stalls. It\u2019s an enormous place, but it\u2019s horribly cold in the\r\nwinter. They talk about pulling down the houses near the corn market to\r\nmake room for two more pavilions. But perhaps you know all this?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, indeed,\u201D replied Florent; \u201CI\u2019ve been abroad. And what\u2019s the name\r\nof that big street in front of us?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, that\u2019s a new street. It\u2019s called the Rue du Pont Neuf. It leads\r\nfrom the Seine through here to the Rue Montmartre and the Rue\r\nMontorgueil. You would soon have recognized where you were if it had\r\nbeen daylight.\u201D\r\n\r\nMadame Francois paused and rose, for she saw a woman heading down to\r\nexamine her turnips. \u201CAh, is that you, Mother Chantemesse?\u201D she said in\r\na friendly way.\r\n\r\nFlorent meanwhile glanced towards the Rue Montorgueil. It was there\r\nthat a body of police officers had arrested him on the night of\r\nDecember 4.[*] He had been walking along the Boulevard Montmartre at\r\nabout two o\u2019clock, quietly making his way through the crowd, and\r\nsmiling at the number of soldiers that the Elysee had sent into the\r\nstreets to awe the people, when the military suddenly began making a\r\nclean sweep of the thoroughfare, shooting folks down at close range\r\nduring a quarter of an hour. Jostled and knocked to the ground, Florent\r\nfell at the corner of the Rue Vivienne and knew nothing further of what\r\nhappened, for the panic-stricken crowd, in their wild terror of being\r\nshot, trampled over his body. Presently, hearing everything quiet, he\r\nmade an attempt to rise; but across him there lay a young woman in a\r\npink bonnet, whose shawl had slipped aside, allowing her chemisette,\r\npleated in little tucks, to be seen. Two bullets had pierced the upper\r\npart of her bosom; and when Florent gently removed the poor creature to\r\nfree his legs, two streamlets of blood oozed from her wounds on to his\r\nhands. Then he sprang up with a sudden bound, and rushed madly away,\r\nhatless and with his hands still wet with blood. Until evening he\r\nwandered about the streets, with his head swimming, ever seeing the\r\nyoung woman lying across his legs with her pale face, her blue staring\r\neyes, her distorted lips, and her expression of astonishment at thus\r\nmeeting death so suddenly. He was a shy, timid fellow. Albeit thirty\r\nyears old he had never dared to stare women in the face; and now, for\r\nthe rest of his life, he was to have that one fixed in his heart and\r\nmemory. He felt as though he had lost some loved one of his own.\r\n\r\n[*] 1851. Two days after the Coup d\u2019Etat.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening, without knowing how he had got there, still dazed and\r\nhorrified as he was by the terrible scenes of the afternoon, he had\r\nfound himself at a wine shop in the Rue Montorgueil, where several men\r\nwere drinking and talking of throwing up barricades. He went away with\r\nthem, helped them to tear up a few paving-stones, and seated himself on\r\nthe barricade, weary with his long wandering through the streets, and\r\nreflecting that he would fight when the soldiers came up. However, he\r\nhad not even a knife with him, and was still bareheaded. Towards eleven\r\no\u2019clock he dozed off, and in his sleep could see the two holes in the\r\ndead woman\u2019s white chemisette glaring at him like eyes reddened by\r\ntears and blood. When he awoke he found himself in the grasp of four\r\npolice officers, who were pummelling him with their fists. The men who\r\nhad built the barricade had fled. The police officers treated him with\r\nstill greater violence, and indeed almost strangled him when they\r\nnoticed that his hands were stained with blood. It was the blood of the\r\nyoung woman.\r\n\r\nFlorent raised his eyes to the luminous dial of Saint Eustache with his\r\nmind so full of these recollections that he did not notice the position\r\nof the pointers. It was, however, nearly four o\u2019clock. The markets were\r\nas yet wrapped in sleep. Madame Francois was still talking to old\r\nMadame Chantemesse, both standing and arguing about the price of\r\nturnips, and Florent now called to mind how narrowly he had escaped\r\nbeing shot over yonder by the wall of Saint Eustache. A detachment of\r\ngendarmes had just blown out the brains of five unhappy fellows caught\r\nat a barricade in the Rue Greneta. The five corpses were lying on the\r\nfootway, at a spot where he thought he could now distinguish a heap of\r\nrosy radishes. He himself had escaped being shot merely because the\r\npolicemen only carried swords. They took him to a neighbouring police\r\nstation and gave the officer in charge a scrap of paper, on which were\r\nthese words written in pencil: \u201CTaken with blood-stained hands. Very\r\ndangerous.\u201D Then he had been dragged from station to station till the\r\nmorning came. The scrap of paper accompanied him wherever he went. He\r\nwas manacled and guarded as though he were a raving madman. At the\r\nstation in the Rue de la Lingerie some tipsy soldiers wanted to shoot\r\nhim; and they had already lighted a lantern with that object when the\r\norder arrived for the prisoners to be taken to the depot of the\r\nPrefecture of Police. Two days afterwards he found himself in a\r\ncasemate of the fort of Bic\u00EAtre. Ever since then he had been suffering\r\nfrom hunger. He had felt hungry in the casemate, and the pangs of\r\nhunger had never since left him. A hundred men were pent in the depths\r\nof that cellar-like dungeon, where, scarce able to breathe, they\r\ndevoured the few mouthfuls of bread that were thrown to them, like so\r\nmany captive wild beasts.\r\n\r\nWhen Florent was brought before an investigating magistrate, without\r\nanyone to defend him, and without any evidence being adduced, he was\r\naccused of belonging to a secret society; and when he swore that this\r\nwas untrue, the magistrate produced the scrap of paper from amongst the\r\ndocuments before him: \u201CTaken with blood-stained hands. Very dangerous.\u201D\r\nThat was quite sufficient. He was condemned to transportation. Six\r\nweeks afterwards, one January night, a gaoler awoke him and locked him\r\nup in a courtyard with more than four hundred other prisoners. An hour\r\nlater this first detachment started for the pontoons and exile,\r\nhandcuffed and guarded by a double file of gendarmes with loaded\r\nmuskets. They crossed the Austerlitz bridge, followed the line of the\r\nboulevards, and so reached the terminus of the Western Railway line. It\r\nwas a joyous carnival night. The windows of the restaurants on the\r\nboulevards glittered with lights. At the top of the Rue Vivienne, just\r\nat the spot where he ever saw the young woman lying dead\u2014that unknown\r\nyoung woman whose image he always bore with him\u2014he now beheld a large\r\ncarriage in which a party of masked women, with bare shoulders and\r\nlaughing voices, were venting their impatience at being detained, and\r\nexpressing their horror of that endless procession of convicts. The\r\nwhole of the way from Paris to Havre the prisoners never received a\r\nmouthful of bread or a drink of water. The officials had forgotten to\r\ngive them their rations before starting, and it was not till thirty-six\r\nhours afterwards, when they had been stowed away in the hold of the\r\nfrigate _Canada_, that they at last broke their fast.\r\n\r\nNo, Florent had never again been free from hunger. He recalled all the\r\npast to mind, but could not recollect a single hour of satiety. He had\r\nbecome dry and withered; his stomach seemed to have shrunk; his skin\r\nclung to his bones. And now that he was back in Paris once more, he\r\nfound it fat and sleek and flourishing, teeming with food in the midst\r\nof the darkness. He had returned to it on a couch of vegetables; he\r\nlingered in its midst encompassed by unknown masses of food which still\r\nand ever increased and disquieted him. Had that happy carnival night\r\ncontinued throughout those seven years, then? Once again he saw the\r\nglittering windows on the boulevards, the laughing women, the\r\nluxurious, greedy city which he had quitted on that far-away January\r\nnight; and it seemed to him that everything had expanded and increased\r\nin harmony with those huge markets, whose gigantic breathing, still\r\nheavy from the indigestion of the previous day, he now began to hear.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Chantemesse had by this time made up her mind to buy a dozen\r\nbunches of turnips. She put them in her apron, which she held closely\r\npressed to her person, thus making herself look yet more corpulent than\r\nshe was; and for some time longer she lingered there, still gossiping\r\nin a drawling voice. When at last she went away, Madame Francois again\r\nsat down by the side of Florent.\r\n\r\n\u201CPoor old Mother Chantemesse!\u201D she said; \u201Cshe must be at least\r\nseventy-two. I can remember her buying turnips of my father when I was\r\na mere chit. And she hasn\u2019t a relation in the world; no one but a young\r\nhussy whom she picked up I don\u2019t know where and who does nothing but\r\nbring her trouble. Still, she manages to live, selling things by the\r\nha\u2019p\u2019orth and clearing her couple of francs profit a day. For my own\r\npart, I\u2019m sure that I could never spend my days on the foot-pavement in\r\nthis horrid Paris! And she hasn\u2019t even any relations here!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou have some relations in Paris, I suppose?\u201D she asked presently,\r\nseeing that Florent seemed disinclined to talk.\r\n\r\nFlorent did not appear to hear her. A feeling of distrust came back to\r\nhim. His head was teeming with old stories of the police, stories of\r\nspies prowling about at every street corner, and of women selling the\r\nsecrets which they managed to worm out of the unhappy fellows they\r\ndeluded. Madame Francois was sitting close beside him and certainly\r\nlooked perfectly straightforward and honest, with her big calm face,\r\nabove which was bound a black and yellow handkerchief. She seemed about\r\nfive and thirty years of age, and was somewhat stoutly built, with a\r\ncertain hardy beauty due to her life in the fresh air. A pair of black\r\neyes, which beamed with kindly tenderness, softened the more masculine\r\ncharacteristics of her person. She certainly was inquisitive, but her\r\ncuriosity was probably well meant.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve a nephew in Paris,\u201D she continued, without seeming at all\r\noffended by Florent\u2019s silence. \u201CHe\u2019s turned out badly though, and has\r\nenlisted. It\u2019s a pleasant thing to have somewhere to go to and stay at,\r\nisn\u2019t it? I dare say there\u2019s a big surprise in store for your relations\r\nwhen they see you. But it\u2019s always a pleasure to welcome one of one\u2019s\r\nown people back again, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe kept her eyes fixed upon him while she spoke, doubtless\r\ncompassionating his extreme scragginess; fancying, too, that there was\r\na \u201Cgentleman\u201D inside those old black rags, and so not daring to slip a\r\npiece of silver into his hand. At last, however, she timidly murmured:\r\n\u201CAll the same, if you should happen just at present to be in want of\r\nanything\u2014\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Florent checked her with uneasy pride. He told her that he had\r\neverything he required, and had a place to go to. She seemed quite\r\npleased to hear this, and, as though to tranquillise herself concerning\r\nhim, repeated several times: \u201CWell, well, in that case you\u2019ve only got\r\nto wait till daylight.\u201D\r\n\r\nA large bell at the corner of the fruit market, just over Florent\u2019s\r\nhead, now began to ring. The slow regular peals seemed to gradually\r\ndissipate the slumber that yet lingered all around. Carts were still\r\narriving, and the shouts of the waggoners, the cracking of their whips,\r\nand the grinding of the paving-stones beneath the iron-bound wheels and\r\nthe horses\u2019 shoes sounded with an increasing din. The carts could now\r\nonly advance by a series of spasmodic jolts, and stretched in a long\r\nline, one behind the other, till they were lost to sight in the distant\r\ndarkness, whence a confused roar ascended.\r\n\r\nUnloading was in progress all along the Rue du Pont Neuf, the vehicles\r\nbeing drawn up close to the edge of the footways, while their teams\r\nstood motionless in close order as at a horse fair. Florent felt\r\ninterested in one enormous tumbrel which was piled up with magnificent\r\ncabbages, and had only been backed to the kerb with the greatest\r\ndifficulty. Its load towered above the lofty gas lamp whose bright\r\nlight fell full upon the broad leaves which looked like pieces of dark\r\ngreen velvet, scalloped and goffered. A young peasant girl, some\r\nsixteen years old, in a blue linen jacket and cap, had climbed on to\r\nthe tumbrel, where, buried in the cabbages to her shoulders, she took\r\nthem one by one and threw them to somebody concealed in the shade\r\nbelow. Every now and then the girl would slip and vanish, overwhelmed\r\nby an avalanche of the vegetables, but her rosy nose soon reappeared\r\namidst the teeming greenery, and she broke into a laugh while the\r\ncabbages again flew down between Florent and the gas lamp. He counted\r\nthem mechanically as they fell. When the cart was emptied he felt\r\nworried.\r\n\r\nThe piles of vegetables on the pavement now extended to the verge of\r\nthe roadway. Between the heaps, the market gardeners left narrow paths\r\nto enable people to pass along. The whole of the wide footway was\r\ncovered from end to end with dark mounds. As yet, in the sudden dancing\r\ngleams of light from the lanterns, you only just espied the luxuriant\r\nfulness of the bundles of artichokes, the delicate green of the\r\nlettuces, the rosy coral of the carrots, and dull ivory of the turnips.\r\nAnd these gleams of rich colour flitted along the heaps, according as\r\nthe lanterns came and went. The footway was now becoming populated: a\r\ncrowd of people had awakened, and was moving hither and thither amidst\r\nthe vegetables, stopping at times, and chattering and shouting. In the\r\ndistance a loud voice could be heard crying, \u201CEndive! who\u2019s got\r\nendive?\u201D The gates of the pavilion devoted to the sale of ordinary\r\nvegetables had just been opened; and the retail dealers who had stalls\r\nthere, with white caps on their heads, fichus knotted over their black\r\njackets, and skirts pinned up to keep them from getting soiled, now\r\nbegan to secure their stock for the day, depositing their purchases in\r\nsome huge porters\u2019 baskets placed upon the ground. Between the roadway\r\nand the pavilion these baskets were to be seen coming and going on all\r\nsides, knocking against the crowded heads of the bystanders, who\r\nresented the pushing with coarse expressions, whilst all around was a\r\nclamour of voices growing hoarse by prolonged wrangling over a sou or\r\ntwo. Florent was astonished by the calmness of the female market\r\ngardeners, with bandanas and bronzed faces, displayed amidst all this\r\ngarrulous bargaining of the markets.\r\n\r\nBehind him, on the footway of the Rue Rambuteau, fruit was being sold.\r\nHampers and low baskets covered with canvas or straw stood there in\r\nlong lines, a strong odour of over-ripe mirabelle plums was wafted\r\nhither and thither. At last a subdued and gentle voice, which he had\r\nheard for some time past, induced him to turn his head, and he saw a\r\ncharming darksome little woman sitting on the ground and bargaining.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome now, Marcel,\u201D said she, \u201Cyou\u2019ll take a hundred sous, won\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe man to whom she was speaking was closely wrapped in his cloak and\r\nmade no reply; however, after a silence of five minutes or more, the\r\nyoung woman returned to the charge.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome now, Marcel; a hundred sous for that basket there, and four\r\nfrancs for the other one; that\u2019ll make nine francs altogether.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen came another interval.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, tell me what you will take.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTen francs. You know that well enough already; I told you so before.\r\nBut what have you done with your Jules this morning, La Sarriette?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe young woman began to laugh as she took a handful of small change\r\nout of her pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201COh,\u201D she replied, \u201CJules is still in bed. He says that men were not\r\nintended to work.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe paid for the two baskets, and carried them into the fruit pavilion,\r\nwhich had just been opened. The market buildings still retained their\r\ngloom-wrapped aspect of airy fragility, streaked with the thousand\r\nlines of light that gleamed from the venetian shutters. People were\r\nbeginning to pass along the broad covered streets intersecting the\r\npavilions, but the more distant buildings still remained deserted\r\namidst the increasing buzz of life on the footways. By Saint Eustache\r\nthe bakers and wine sellers were taking down their shutters, and the\r\nruddy shops, with their gas lights flaring, showed like gaps of fire in\r\nthe gloom in which the grey house-fronts were yet steeped. Florent\r\nnoticed a baker\u2019s shop on the left-hand side of the Rue Montorgueil,\r\nreplete and golden with its last baking, and fancied he could scent the\r\npleasant smell of the hot bread. It was now half past four.\r\n\r\nMadame Francois by this time had disposed of nearly all her stock. She\r\nhad only a few bunches of carrots left when Lacaille once more made his\r\nappearance with his sack.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D said he, \u201Cwill you take a sou now?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI knew I should see you again,\u201D the good woman quietly answered.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019d better take all I have left. There are seventeen bunches.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat makes seventeen sous.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; thirty-four.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt last they agreed to fix the price at twenty-five sous. Madame\r\nFrancois was anxious to be off.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019d been keeping his eye upon me all the time,\u201D she said to Florent,\r\nwhen Lacaille had gone off with the carrots in his sack. \u201CThat old\r\nrogue runs things down all over the markets, and he often waits till\r\nthe last peal of the bell before spending four sous in purchase. Oh,\r\nthese Paris folk! They\u2019ll wrangle and argue for an hour to save half a\r\nsou, and then go off and empty their purses at the wine shop.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhenever Madame Francois talked of Paris she always spoke in a tone of\r\ndisdain, and referred to the city as though it were some ridiculous,\r\ncontemptible, far-away place, in which she only condescended to set\r\nfoot at nighttime.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere!\u201D she continued, sitting down again, beside Florent, on some\r\nvegetables belonging to a neighbour, \u201CI can get away now.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent bent his head. He had just committed a theft. When Lacaille\r\nwent off he had caught sight of a carrot lying on the ground, and\r\nhaving picked it up he was holding it tightly in his right hand. Behind\r\nhim were some bundles of celery and bunches of parsley were diffusing\r\npungent odours which painfully affected him.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I\u2019m off now!\u201D said Madame Francois.\r\n\r\nHowever, she felt interested in this stranger, and could divine that he\r\nwas suffering there on that foot-pavement, from which he had never\r\nstirred. She made him fresh offers of assistance, but he again refused\r\nthem, with a still more bitter show of pride. He even got up and\r\nremained standing to prove that he was quite strong again. Then, as\r\nMadame Francois turned her head away, he put the carrot to his mouth.\r\nBut he had to remove it for a moment, in spite of the terrible longing\r\nwhich he felt to dig his teeth into it; for Madame Francois turned\r\nround again and looking him full in the face, began to question him\r\nwith her good-natured womanly curiosity. Florent, to avoid speaking,\r\nmerely answered by nods and shakes of the head. Then, slowly and\r\ngently, he began to eat the carrot.\r\n\r\nThe worthy woman was at last on the point of going off, when a powerful\r\nvoice exclaimed close beside her, \u201CGood morning, Madame Francois.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a slim young man, with big bones and a big head. His\r\nface was bearded, and he had a very delicate nose and narrow sparkling\r\neyes. He wore on his head a rusty, battered, black felt hat, and was\r\nbuttoned up in an immense overcoat, which had once been of a soft\r\nchestnut hue, but which rain had discoloured and streaked with long\r\ngreenish stains. Somewhat bent, and quivering with a nervous\r\nrestlessness which was doubtless habitual with him, he stood there in a\r\npair of heavy laced shoes, and the shortness of his trousers allowed a\r\nglimpse of his coarse blue hose.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood morning, Monsieur Claude,\u201D the market gardener replied\r\ncheerfully. \u201CI expected you, you know, last Monday, and, as you didn\u2019t\r\ncome, I\u2019ve taken care of your canvas for you. I\u2019ve hung it up on a nail\r\nin my room.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are really very kind, Madame Francois. I\u2019ll go to finish that\r\nstudy of mine one of these days. I wasn\u2019t able to go on Monday. Has\r\nyour big plum tree still got all its leaves?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, indeed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wanted to know, because I mean to put it in a corner of the picture.\r\nIt will come in nicely by the side of the fowl house. I have been\r\nthinking about it all the week. What lovely vegetables are in the\r\nmarket this morning! I came down very early, expecting a fine sunrise\r\neffect upon all these heaps of cabbages.\u201D\r\n\r\nWith a wave of the arm he indicated the footway.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, well, I must be off now,\u201D said Madame Francois. \u201CGood-bye for\r\nthe present. We shall meet again soon, I hope, Monsieur Claude.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, as she turned to go, she introduced Florent to the young\r\nartist.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis gentleman, it seems, has just come from a distance,\u201D said she.\r\n\u201CHe feels quite lost in your scampish Paris. I dare say you might be of\r\nservice to him.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she at last took her departure, feeling pleased at having left the\r\ntwo men together. Claude looked at Florent with a feeling of interest.\r\nThat tall, slight, wavy figure seemed to him original. Madame\r\nFrancois\u2019s hasty presentation was in his eyes quite sufficient, and he\r\naddressed Florent with the easy familiarity of a lounger accustomed to\r\nall sorts of chance encounters.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll accompany you,\u201D he said; \u201Cwhich way are you going?\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent felt ill at ease; he was not wont to unbosom himself so\r\nreadily. However, ever since his arrival in Paris, a question had been\r\ntrembling on his lips, and now he ventured to ask it, with the evident\r\nfear of receiving an unfavourable reply.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs the Rue Pirouette still in existence?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes,\u201D answered the artist. \u201CA very curious corner of old Paris is\r\nthe Rue Pirouette. It twists and turns like a dancing girl, and the\r\nhouses bulge out like pot-bellied gluttons. I\u2019ve made an etching of it\r\nthat isn\u2019t half bad. I\u2019ll show it to you when you come to see me. Is it\r\nto the Rue Pirouette that you want to go?\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent, who felt easier and more cheerful now that he knew the street\r\nstill existed, declared that he did not want to go there; in fact, he\r\ndid not want to go anywhere in particular. All his distrust awoke into\r\nfresh life at Claude\u2019s insistence.\r\n\r\n\u201COh! never mind,\u201D said the artist, \u201Clet\u2019s go to the Rue Pirouette all\r\nthe same. It has such a fine colour at night time. Come along; it\u2019s\r\nonly a couple of yards away.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent felt constrained to follow him, and the two men walked off,\r\nside by side, stepping over the hampers and vegetables like a couple of\r\nold friends. On the footway of the Rue Rambuteau there were some\r\nimmense heaps of cauliflowers, symmetrically piled up like so many\r\ncannonballs. The soft-white flowers spread out like huge roses in the\r\nmidst of their thick green leaves, and the piles had something of the\r\nappearance of bridal bouquets ranged in a row in colossal flower\r\nstands. Claude stopped in front of them, venting cries of admiration.\r\n\r\nThen, on turning into the Rue Pirouette, which was just opposite, he\r\npointed out each house to his companion, and explained his views\r\nconcerning it. There was only a single gas lamp, burning in a corner.\r\nThe buildings, which had settled down and swollen, threw their\r\npent-houses forward in such wise as to justify Claude\u2019s allusion to\r\npot-bellied gluttons, whilst their gables receded, and on either side\r\nthey clung to their neighbours for support. Three or four, however,\r\nstanding in gloomy recesses, appeared to be on the point of toppling\r\nforward. The solitary gas lamp illumined one which was snowy with a\r\nfresh coat of whitewash, suggesting some flabby broken-down old\r\ndowager, powdered and bedaubed in the hope of appearing young. Then the\r\nothers stretched away into the darkness, bruised, dented, and cracked,\r\ngreeny with the fall of water from their roofs, and displaying such an\r\nextraordinary variety of attitudes and tints that Claude could not\r\nrefrain from laughing as he contemplated them.\r\n\r\nFlorent, however, came to stand at the corner of the rue de Mondetour,\r\nin front of the last house but one on the left. Here the three floors,\r\neach with two shutterless windows, having little white curtains closely\r\ndrawn, seemed wrapped in sleep; but, up above, a light could be seen\r\nflitting behind the curtains of a tiny gable casement. However, the\r\nsight of the shop beneath the pent-house seemed to fill Florent with\r\nthe deepest emotion. It was kept by a dealer in cooked vegetables, and\r\nwas just being opened. At its far end some metal pans were glittering,\r\nwhile on several earthen ones in the window there was a display of\r\ncooked spinach and endive, reduced to a paste and arranged in conical\r\nmounds from which customers were served with shovel-like carvers of\r\nwhite metal, only the handles of which were visible. This sight seemed\r\nto rivet Florent to the ground with surprise. He evidently could not\r\nrecognize the place. He read the name of the shopkeeper, Godeboeuf,\r\nwhich was painted on a red sign board up above, and remained quite\r\novercome by consternation. His arms dangling beside him, he began to\r\nexamine the cooked spinach, with the despairing air of one on whom some\r\nsupreme misfortune falls.\r\n\r\nHowever, the gable casement was now opened, and a little old woman\r\nleaned out of it, and looked first at the sky and then at the markets\r\nin the distance.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, Mademoiselle Saget is an early riser,\u201D exclaimed Claude, who had\r\njust raised his head. And, turning to his companion, he added: \u201CI once\r\nhad an aunt living in that house. It\u2019s a regular hive of tittle-tattle!\r\nAh, the Mehudins are stirring now, I see. There\u2019s a light on the second\r\nfloor.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent would have liked to question his companion, but the latter\u2019s\r\nlong discoloured overcoat give him a disquieting appearance. So without\r\na word Florent followed him, whilst he went on talking about the\r\nMehudins. These Mehudins were fish-girls, it seemed; the older one was\r\na magnificent creature, while the younger one, who sold fresh-water\r\nfish, reminded Claude of one of Murillo\u2019s virgins, whenever he saw her\r\nstanding with her fair face amidst her carps and eels.\r\n\r\nFrom this Claude went on to remark with asperity that Murillo painted\r\nlike an ignoramus. But all at once he stopped short in the middle of\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome!\u201D he exclaimed, \u201Ctell me where it is that you want to go.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t want to go anywhere just at present,\u201D replied Florent in\r\nconfusion. \u201CLet\u2019s go wherever you like.\u201D\r\n\r\nJust as they were leaving the Rue Pirouette, some one called to Claude\r\nfrom a wine shop at the corner of the street. The young man went in,\r\ndragging Florent with him. The shutters had been taken down on one side\r\nonly, and the gas was still burning in the sleepy atmosphere of the\r\nshop. A forgotten napkin and some cards that had been used in the\r\nprevious evening\u2019s play were still lying on the tables; and the fresh\r\nbreeze that streamed in through the open doorway freshened the close,\r\nwarm vinous air. The landlord, Monsieur Lebigre, was serving his\r\ncustomers. He wore a sleeved waistcoat, and his fat regular features,\r\nfringed by an untidy beard, were still pale with sleep. Standing in\r\nfront of the counter, groups of men, with heavy, tired eyes, were\r\ndrinking, coughing, and spitting, whilst trying to rouse themselves by\r\nthe aid of white wine and brandy. Amongst them Florent recognised\r\nLacaille, whose sack now overflowed with various sorts of vegetables.\r\nHe was taking his third dram with a friend, who was telling him a long\r\nstory about the purchase of a hamper of potatoes.[*] When he had\r\nemptied his glass, he went to chat with Monsieur Lebigre in a little\r\nglazed compartment at the end of the room, where the gas had not yet\r\nbeen lighted.\r\n\r\n[*] At the Paris central markets potatoes are sold by the hamper, not\r\nby the sack as in England.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat will you take?\u201D Claude asked of Florent.\r\n\r\nHe had on entering grasped the hand of the person who had called out to\r\nhim. This was a market porter,[*] a well-built young man of two and\r\ntwenty at the most. His cheeks and chin were clean-shaven, but he wore\r\na small moustache, and looked a sprightly, strapping fellow with his\r\nbroad-brimmed hat covered with chalk, and his wool-worked neck-piece,\r\nthe straps falling from which tightened his short blue blouse. Claude,\r\nwho called him Alexandre, patted his arms, and asked him when they were\r\ngoing to Charentonneau again. Then they talked about a grand excursion\r\nthey had made together in a boat on the Marne, when they had eaten a\r\nrabbit for supper in the evening.\r\n\r\n[*] _Fort_ is the French term, literally \u201Ca strong man,\u201D as every\r\nmarket porter needs to be.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, what will you take?\u201D Claude again asked Florent.\r\n\r\nThe latter looked at the counter in great embarrassment. At one end of\r\nit some stoneware pots, encircled with brass bands and containing punch\r\nand hot wine, were standing over the short blue flames of a gas stove.\r\nFlorent at last confessed that a glass of something warm would be\r\nwelcome. Monsieur Lebigre thereupon served them with three glasses of\r\npunch. In a basket near the pots were some smoking hot rolls which had\r\nonly just arrived. However, as neither of the others took one, Florent\r\nlikewise refrained, and drank his punch. He felt it slipping down into\r\nhis empty stomach, like a steam of molten lead. It was Alexandre who\r\npaid for the \u201Cshout.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s a fine fellow, that Alexandre!\u201D said Claude, when he and Florent\r\nfound themselves alone again on the footway of the Rue Rambuteau. \u201CHe\u2019s\r\na very amusing companion to take into the country. He\u2019s fond of showing\r\nhis strength. And then he\u2019s so magnificently built! I have seen him\r\nstripped. Ah, if I could only get him to pose for me in the nude out in\r\nthe open air! Well, we\u2019ll go and take a turn through the markets now,\r\nif you like.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent followed, yielding entirely to his new friend\u2019s guidance. A\r\nbright glow at the far end of the Rue Rambuteau announced the break of\r\nday. The far-spreading voice of the markets was become more sonorous,\r\nand every now and then the peals of a bell ringing in some distant\r\npavilion mingled with the swelling, rising clamour. Claude and Florent\r\nentered one of the covered streets between the fish and poultry\r\npavilions. Florent raised his eyes and looked at the lofty vault\r\noverhead, the inner timbers of which glistened amidst a black lacework\r\nof iron supports. As he turned into the great central thoroughfare he\r\npictured himself in some strange town, with its various districts and\r\nsuburbs, promenades and streets, squares and cross-roads, all suddenly\r\nplaced under shelter on a rainy day by the whim of some gigantic power.\r\nThe deep gloom brooding in the hollows of the roofs multiplied, as it\r\nwere, the forest of pillars, and infinitely increased the number of the\r\ndelicate ribs, railed galleries, and transparent shutters. And over the\r\nphantom city and far away into the depths of the shade, a teeming,\r\nflowering vegetation of luxuriant metal-work, with spindle-shaped stems\r\nand twining knotted branches, covered the vast expanse as with the\r\nfoliage of some ancient forest. Several departments of the markets\r\nstill slumbered behind their closed iron gates. The butter and poultry\r\npavilions displayed rows of little trellised stalls and long alleys,\r\nwhich lines of gas lights showed to be deserted. The fish market,\r\nhowever, had just been opened, and women were flitting to and fro\r\namongst the white slabs littered with shadowy hampers and cloths. Among\r\nthe vegetables and fruit and flowers the noise and bustle were\r\ngradually increasing. The whole place was by degree waking up, from the\r\npopular quarter where the cabbages are piled at four o\u2019clock in the\r\nmorning, to the lazy and wealthy district which only hangs up its\r\npullets and pheasants when the hands of the clock point to eight.\r\n\r\nThe great covered alleys were now teeming with life. All along the\r\nfootways on both sides of the road there were still many market\r\ngardeners, with other small growers from the environs of Paris, who\r\ndisplayed baskets containing their \u201Cgatherings\u201D of the previous\r\nevening\u2014bundles of vegetables and clusters of fruit. Whilst the crowd\r\nincessantly paced hither and thither, vehicles barred the road; and\r\nFlorent, in order to pass them, had to press against some dingy sacks,\r\nlike coal-sacks in appearance, and so numerous and heavy that the\r\naxle-trees of the vans bent beneath them. They were quite damp, and\r\nexhaled a fresh odour of seaweed. From a rent low down in the side of\r\none of them a black stream of big mussels was trickling.\r\n\r\nFlorent and Claude had now to pause at every step. The fish was\r\narriving and one after another the drays of the railway companies drove\r\nup laden with wooden cages full of the hampers and baskets that had\r\ncome by train from the sea coast. And to get out of the way of the fish\r\ndrays, which became more and more numerous and disquieting, the artist\r\nand Florent rushed amongst the wheels of the drays laden with butter\r\nand eggs and cheese, huge yellow vehicles bearing coloured lanterns,\r\nand drawn by four horses. The market porters carried the cases of eggs,\r\nand baskets of cheese and butter, into the auction pavilion, where\r\nclerks were making entries in note books by the light of the gas.\r\n\r\nClaude was quite charmed with all this uproar, and forgot everything to\r\ngaze at some effect of light, some group of blouses, or the picturesque\r\nunloading of a cart. At last they extricated themselves from the crowd,\r\nand as they continued on their way along the main artery they presently\r\nfound themselves amidst an exquisite perfume which seemed to be\r\nfollowing them. They were in the cut-flower market. All over the\r\nfootways, to the right and left, women were seated in front of large\r\nrectangular baskets full of bunches of roses, violets, dahlias, and\r\nmarguerites. At times the clumps darkened and looked like splotches of\r\nblood, at others they brightened into silvery greys of the softest\r\ntones. A lighted candle, standing near one basket, set amidst the\r\ngeneral blackness quite a melody of colour\u2014the bright variegations of\r\nmarguerites, the blood-red crimson of dahlias, the bluey purple of\r\nviolets, and the warm flesh tints of roses. And nothing could have been\r\nsweeter or more suggestive of springtide than this soft breath of\r\nperfume encountered on the footway, on emerging from the sharp odours\r\nof the fish market and the pestilential smell of the butter and the\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nClaude and Florent turned round and strolled about, loitering among the\r\nflowers. They halted with some curiosity before several women who were\r\nselling bunches of fern and bundles of vine-leaves, neatly tied up in\r\npackets of five and twenty. Then they turned down another covered\r\nalley, which was almost deserted, and where their footsteps echoed as\r\nthough they had been walking through a church. Here they found a little\r\ncart, scarcely larger than a wheelbarrow, to which was harnessed a\r\ndiminutive donkey, who, no doubt, felt bored, for at sight of them he\r\nbegan braying with such prolonged and sonorous force that the vast\r\nroofing of the markets fairly trembled. Then the horses began to neigh\r\nin reply, there was a sound of pawing and tramping, a distant uproar,\r\nwhich swelled, rolled along, then died away.\r\n\r\nMeantime, in the Rue Berger in front of them, Claude and Florent\r\nperceived a number of bare, frontless, salesmen\u2019s shops, where, by the\r\nlight of flaring gas jets, they could distinguish piles of hampers and\r\nfruit, enclosed by three dirty walls which were covered with addition\r\nsums in pencil. And the two wanderers were still standing there,\r\ncontemplating this scene, when they noticed a well-dressed woman\r\nhuddled up in a cab which looked quite lost and forlorn in the block of\r\ncarts as it stealthily made its way onwards.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s Cinderella coming back without her slippers,\u201D remarked Claude\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\nThey began chatting together as they went back towards the markets.\r\nClaude whistled as he strolled along with his hands in his pockets, and\r\nexpatiated on his love for this mountain of food which rises every\r\nmorning in the very centre of Paris. He prowled about the footways\r\nnight after night, dreaming of colossal still-life subjects, paintings\r\nof an extraordinary character. He had even started on one, having his\r\nfriend Marjolin and that jade Cadine to pose for him; but it was hard\r\nwork to paint those confounded vegetables and fruit and fish and\r\nmeat\u2014they were all so beautiful! Florent listened to the artist\u2019s\r\nenthusiastic talk with a void and hunger-aching stomach. It did not\r\nseem to occur to Claude that all those things were intended to be\r\neaten. Their charm for him lay in their colour. Suddenly, however, he\r\nceased speaking and, with a gesture that was habitual to him, tightened\r\nthe long red sash which he wore under his green-stained coat.\r\n\r\nAnd then with a sly expression he resumed:\r\n\r\n\u201CBesides, I breakfast here, through my eyes, at any rate, and that\u2019s\r\nbetter than getting nothing at all. Sometimes, when I\u2019ve forgotten to\r\ndine on the previous day, I treat myself to a perfect fit of\r\nindigestion in the morning by watching the carts arrive here laden with\r\nall sorts of good things. On such mornings as those I love my\r\nvegetables more than ever. Ah! the exasperating part, the rank\r\ninjustice of it all, is that those rascally Philistines really eat\r\nthese things!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he went on to tell Florent of a supper to which a friend had\r\ntreated him at Baratte\u2019s on a day of affluence. They had partaken of\r\noysters, fish, and game. But Baratte\u2019s had sadly fallen, and all the\r\ncarnival life of the old March\u00E9 des Innocents was now buried. In place\r\nthereof they had those huge central markets, that colossus of ironwork,\r\nthat new and wonderful town. Fools might say what they liked; it was\r\nthe embodiment of the spirit of the times. Florent, however, could not\r\nat first make out whether he was condemning the picturesqueness of\r\nBaratte\u2019s or its good cheer.\r\n\r\nBut Claude next began to inveigh against romanticism. He preferred his\r\npiles of vegetables, he said, to the rags of the middle ages; and he\r\nended by reproaching himself with guilty weakness in making an etching\r\nof the Rue Pirouette. All those grimy old places ought to be levelled\r\nto the ground, he declared, and modern houses ought to be built in\r\ntheir stead.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere!\u201D he exclaimed, coming to a halt, \u201Clook at the corner of the\r\nfootway yonder! Isn\u2019t that a picture readymade, ever so much more human\r\nand natural than all their confounded consumptive daubs?\u201D\r\n\r\nAlong the covered way women were now selling hot soup and coffee. At\r\none corner of the foot-pavement a large circle of customers clustered\r\nround a vendor of cabbage soup. The bright tin caldron, full of broth,\r\nwas steaming over a little low stove, through the holes of which came\r\nthe pale glow of the embers. From a napkin-lined basket the woman took\r\nsome thin slices of bread and dropped them into yellow cups; then with\r\na ladle she filled the cups with liquor. Around her were saleswomen\r\nneatly dressed, market gardeners in blouses, porters with coats soiled\r\nby the loads they had carried, poor ragged vagabonds\u2014in fact, all the\r\nearly hungry ones of the markets, eating, and scalding their mouths,\r\nand drawing back their chins to avoid soiling them with the drippings\r\nfrom their spoons. The delighted artist blinked, and sought a point of\r\nview so as to get a good ensemble of the picture. That cabbage soup,\r\nhowever, exhaled a very strong odour. Florent, for his part, turned his\r\nhead away, distressed by the sight of the full cups which the customers\r\nemptied in silence, glancing around them the while like suspicious\r\nanimals. As the woman began serving a fresh customer, Claude himself\r\nwas affected by the odorous steam of the soup, which was wafted full in\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nHe again tightened his sash, half amused and half annoyed. Then\r\nresuming his walk, and alluding to the punch paid for by Alexandre, he\r\nsaid to Florent in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s very odd, but have you ever noticed that although a man can\r\nalways find somebody to treat him to something to drink, he can never\r\nfind a soul who will stand him anything to eat?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe dawn was now rising. The houses on the Boulevard de Sebastopol at\r\nthe end of the Rue de la Cossonnerie were still black; but above the\r\nsharp line of their slate roofs a patch of pale blue sky, circumscribed\r\nby the arch-pieces of the covered way, showed like a gleaming\r\nhalf-moon. Claude, who had been bending over some grated openings on a\r\nlevel with the ground, through which a glimpse could be obtained of\r\ndeep cellars where gas lights glimmered, now glanced up into the air\r\nbetween the lofty pillars, as though scanning the dark roofs which\r\nfringed the clear sky. Then he halted again, with his eyes fixed on one\r\nof the light iron ladders which connect the superposed market roofs and\r\ngive access from one to the other. Florent asked him what he was\r\nseeking there.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m looking for that scamp of a Marjolin,\u201D replied the artist. \u201CHe\u2019s\r\nsure to be in some guttering up there, unless, indeed, he\u2019s been\r\nspending the night in the poultry cellars. I want him to give me a\r\nsitting.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he went on to relate how a market saleswoman had found his friend\r\nMarjolin one morning in a pile of cabbages, and how Marjolin had grown\r\nup in all liberty on the surrounding footways. When an attempt had been\r\nmade to send him to school he had fallen ill, and it had been necessary\r\nto bring him back to the markets. He knew every nook and corner of\r\nthem, and loved them with a filial affection, leading the agile life of\r\na squirrel in that forest of ironwork. He and Cadine, the hussy whom\r\nMother Chantemesse had picked up one night in the old Market of the\r\nInnocents, made a pretty couple\u2014he, a splendid foolish fellow, as\r\nglowing as a Rubens, with a ruddy down on his skin which attracted the\r\nsunlight; and she, slight and sly, with a comical phiz under her tangle\r\nof black curly hair.\r\n\r\nWhilst talking Claude quickened his steps, and soon brought his\r\ncompanion back to Saint Eustache again. Florent, whose legs were once\r\nmore giving way, dropped upon a bench near the omnibus office. The\r\nmorning air was freshening. At the far end of the Rue Rambuteau rosy\r\ngleams were streaking the milky sky, which higher up was slashed by\r\nbroad grey rifts. Such was the sweet balsamic scent of this dawn, that\r\nFlorent for a moment fancied himself in the open country, on the brow\r\nof a hill. But behind the bench Claude pointed out to him the many\r\naromatic herbs and bulbs on sale. All along the footway skirting the\r\ntripe market there were, so to say, fields of thyme and lavender,\r\ngarlic and shallots; and round the young plane-trees on the pavement\r\nthe vendors had twined long branches of laurel, forming trophies of\r\ngreenery. The strong scent of the laurel leaves prevailed over every\r\nother odour.\r\n\r\nAt present the luminous dial of Saint Eustache was paling as a\r\nnight-light does when surprised by the dawn. The gas jets in the wine\r\nshops in the neighbouring streets went out one by one, like stars\r\nextinguished by the brightness. And Florent gazed at the vast markets\r\nnow gradually emerging from the gloom, from the dreamland in which he\r\nhad beheld them, stretching out their ranges of open palaces.\r\nGreenish-grey in hue, they looked more solid now, and even more\r\ncolossal with their prodigious masting of columns upholding an endless\r\nexpanse of roofs. They rose up in geometrically shaped masses; and when\r\nall the inner lights had been extinguished and the square uniform\r\nbuildings were steeped in the rising dawn, they seemed typical of some\r\ngigantic modern machine, some engine, some caldron for the supply of a\r\nwhole people, some colossal belly, bolted and riveted, built up of wood\r\nand glass and iron, and endowed with all the elegance and power of some\r\nmechanical motive appliance working there with flaring furnaces, and\r\nwild, bewildering revolutions of wheels.\r\n\r\nClaude, however, had enthusiastically sprung on to the bench, and stood\r\nupon it. He compelled his companion to admire the effect of the dawn\r\nrising over the vegetables. There was a perfect sea of these extending\r\nbetween the two clusters of pavilions from Saint Eustache to the Rue\r\ndes Halles. And in the two open spaces at either end the flood of\r\ngreenery rose to even greater height, and quite submerged the\r\npavements. The dawn appeared slowly, softly grey in hue, and spreading\r\na light water-colour tint over everything. These surging piles akin to\r\nhurrying waves, this river of verdure rushing along the roadway like an\r\nautumn torrent, assumed delicate shadowy tints\u2014tender violet,\r\nblush-rose, and greeny yellow, all the soft, light hues which at\r\nsunrise make the sky look like a canopy of shot silk. And by degrees,\r\nas the fires of dawn rose higher and higher at the far end of the Rue\r\nRambuteau, the mass of vegetation grew brighter and brighter, emerging\r\nmore and more distinctly from the bluey gloom that clung to the ground.\r\nSalad herbs, cabbage-lettuce, endive, and succory, with rich soil still\r\nclinging to their roots, exposed their swelling hearts; bundles of\r\nspinach, bundles of sorrel, clusters of artichokes, piles of peas and\r\nbeans, mounds of cos-lettuce, tied round with straws, sounded every\r\nnote in the whole gamut of greenery, from the sheeny lacquer-like green\r\nof the pods to the deep-toned green of the foliage; a continuous gamut\r\nwith ascending and descending scales which died away in the variegated\r\ntones of the heads of celery and bundles of leeks. But the highest and\r\nmost sonorous notes still came from the patches of bright carrots and\r\nsnowy turnips, strewn in prodigious quantities all along the markets\r\nand lighting them up with the medley of their two colours.\r\n\r\nAt the crossway in the Rue des Halles cabbages were piled up in\r\nmountains; there were white ones, hard and compact as metal balls,\r\ncurly savoys, whose great leaves made them look like basins of green\r\nbronze, and red cabbages, which the dawn seemed to transform into\r\nsuperb masses of bloom with the hue of wine-lees, splotched with dark\r\npurple and carmine. At the other side of the markets, at the crossway\r\nnear Saint Eustache, the end of the Rue Rambuteau was blocked by a\r\nbarricade of orange-hued pumpkins, sprawling with swelling bellies in\r\ntwo superposed rows. And here and there gleamed the glistening ruddy\r\nbrown of a hamper of onions, the blood-red crimson of a heap of\r\ntomatoes, the quiet yellow of a display of marrows, and the sombre\r\nviolet of the fruit of the eggplant; while numerous fat black radishes\r\nstill left patches of gloom amidst the quivering brilliance of the\r\ngeneral awakening.\r\n\r\nClaude clapped his hands at the sight. He declared that those\r\n\u201Cblackguard vegetables\u201D were wild, mad, sublime! He stoutly maintained\r\nthat they were not yet dead, but, gathered in the previous evening,\r\nwaited for the morning sun to bid him good-bye from the flag-stones of\r\nthe market. He could observe their vitality, he declared, see their\r\nleaves stir and open as though their roots were yet firmly and warmly\r\nembedded in well-manured soil. And here, in the markets, he added, he\r\nheard the death-rattle of all the kitchen gardens of the environs of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nA crowd of white caps, loose black jackets, and blue blouses was\r\nswarming in the narrow paths between the various piles. The big baskets\r\nof the market porters passed along slowly, above the heads of the\r\nthrong. Retail dealers, costermongers, and greengrocers were making\r\ntheir purchases in haste. Corporals and nuns clustered round the\r\nmountains of cabbages, and college cooks prowled about inquisitively,\r\non the look-out for good bargains. The unloading was still going on;\r\nheavy tumbrels, discharging their contents as though these were so many\r\npaving-stones, added more and more waves to the sea of greenery which\r\nwas now beating against the opposite footways. And from the far end of\r\nthe Rue du Pont Neuf fresh rows of carts were still and ever arriving.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a fine sight it is!\u201D exclaimed Claude in an ecstasy of\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nFlorent was suffering keenly. He fancied that all this was some\r\nsupernatural temptation, and, unwilling to look at the markets any\r\nlonger, turned towards Saint Eustache, a side view of which he obtained\r\nfrom the spot where he now stood. With its roses, and broad arched\r\nwindows, its bell-turret, and roofs of slate, it looked as though\r\npainted in sepia against the blue of the sky. He fixed his eyes at last\r\non the sombre depths of the Rue Montorgueil, where fragments of gaudy\r\nsign boards showed conspicuously, and on the corner of the Rue\r\nMontmartre, where there were balconies gleaming with letters of gold.\r\nAnd when he again glanced at the cross-roads, his gaze was solicited by\r\nother sign boards, on which such inscriptions as \u201CDruggist and\r\nChemist,\u201D \u201CFlour and Grain\u201D appeared in big red and black capital\r\nletters upon faded backgrounds. Near these corners, houses with narrow\r\nwindows were now awakening, setting amidst the newness and airiness of\r\nthe Rue du Pont Neuf a few of the yellow ancient facades of olden\r\nParis. Standing at the empty windows of the great drapery shop at the\r\ncorner of the Rue Rambuteau a number of spruce-looking counter-jumpers\r\nin their shirt sleeves, with snowy-white wristbands and tight-fitting\r\npantaloons, were \u201Cdressing\u201D their goods. Farther away, in the windows\r\nof the severe looking, barrack-like Guillot establishment, biscuits in\r\ngilt wrappers and fancy cakes on glass stands were tastefully set out.\r\nAll the shops were now open; and workmen in white blouses, with tools\r\nunder their arms, were hurrying along the road.\r\n\r\nClaude had not yet got down from the bench. He was standing on tiptoe\r\nin order to see the farther down the streets. Suddenly, in the midst of\r\nthe crowd which he overlooked, he caught sight of a fair head with long\r\nwavy locks, followed by a little black one covered with curly tumbled\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\u201CHallo, Marjolin! Hallo, Cadine!\u201D he shouted; and then, as his voice\r\nwas drowned by the general uproar, he jumped to the ground and started\r\noff. But all at once, recollecting that he had left Florent behind him,\r\nhe hastily came back. \u201CI live at the end of the Impasse des\r\nBourdonnais,\u201D he said rapidly. \u201CMy name\u2019s written in chalk on the door,\r\nClaude Lantier. Come and see the etching of the Rue Pirouette.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he vanished. He was quite ignorant of Florent\u2019s name, and, after\r\nfavouring him with his views on art, parted from him as he had met him,\r\nat the roadside.\r\n\r\nFlorent was now alone, and at first this pleased him. Ever since Madame\r\nFrancoise had picked him up in the Avenue de Neuilly he had been coming\r\nand going in a state of pain fraught somnolence which had quite\r\nprevented him from forming any definite ideas of his surroundings. Now\r\nat last he was at liberty to do what he liked, and he tried to shake\r\nhimself free from that intolerable vision of teeming food by which he\r\nwas pursued. But his head still felt empty and dizzy, and all that he\r\ncould find within him was a kind of vague fear. The day was now growing\r\nquite bright, and he could be distinctly seen. He looked down at his\r\nwretched shabby coat and trousers. He buttoned the first, dusted the\r\nlatter, and strove to make a bit of a toilet, fearing lest those black\r\nrags of his should proclaim aloud whence he had come. He was seated in\r\nthe middle of the bench, by the side of some wandering vagabonds who\r\nhad settled themselves there while waiting for the sunrise. The\r\nneighbourhood of the markets is a favourite spot with vagrants in the\r\nsmall hours of the morning. However, two constables, still in night\r\nuniform, with cloaks and _kepis_, paced up and down the footway side by\r\nside, their hands resting behind their backs; and every time they\r\npassed the bench they glanced at the game which they scented there.\r\nFlorent felt sure that they recognised him, and were consulting\r\ntogether about arresting him. At this thought his anguish of mind\r\nbecame extreme. He felt a wild desire to get up and run away; but he\r\ndid not dare to do so, and was quite at a loss as to how he might take\r\nhimself off. The repeated glances of the constables, their cold,\r\ndeliberate scrutiny caused him the keenest torture. At length he rose\r\nfrom the bench, making a great effort to restrain himself from rushing\r\noff as quickly as his long legs could carry him; and succeeded in\r\nwalking quietly away, though his shoulders quivered in the fear he felt\r\nof suddenly feeling the rough hands of the constables clutching at his\r\ncollar from behind.\r\n\r\nHe had now only one thought, one desire, which was to get away from the\r\nmarkets as quickly as possible. He would wait and make his\r\ninvestigations later on, when the footways should be clear. The three\r\nstreets which met here\u2014the Rue Montmartre, Rue Montorgueil, and Rue\r\nTurbigo\u2014filled him with uneasiness. They were blocked by vehicles of\r\nall kinds, and their footways were crowded with vegetables. Florent\r\nwent straight along as far as the Rue Pierre Lescot, but there the\r\ncress and the potato markets seemed to him insuperable obstacles. So he\r\nresolved to take the Rue Rambuteau. On reaching the Boulevard de\r\nSebastopol, however, he came across such a block of vans and carts and\r\nwaggonettes that he turned back and proceeded along the Rue Saint\r\nDenis. Then he got amongst the vegetables once more. Retail dealers had\r\njust set up their stalls, formed of planks resting on tall hampers; and\r\nthe deluge of cabbages and carrots and turnips began all over again.\r\nThe markets were overflowing. Florent tried to make his escape from\r\nthis pursuing flood which ever overtook him in his flight. He tried the\r\nRue de la Cossonnerie, the Rue Berger, the Square des Innocents, the\r\nRue de la Ferronnerie, and the Rue des Halles. And at last he came to a\r\nstandstill, quite discouraged and scared at finding himself unable to\r\nescape from the infernal circle of vegetables, which now seemed to\r\ndance around him, twining clinging verdure about his legs.\r\n\r\nThe everlasting stream of carts and horses stretched away as far as the\r\nRue de Rivoli and the Place de l\u2019H\u00F4tel de Ville. Huge vans were\r\ncarrying away supplies for all the greengrocers and fruiterers of an\r\nentire district; _chars-a-bancs_ were starting for the suburbs with\r\nstraining, groaning sides. In the Rue de Pont Neuf Florent got\r\ncompletely bewildered. He stumbled upon a crowd of hand-carts, in which\r\nnumerous costermongers were arranging their purchases. Amongst them he\r\nrecognised Lacaille, who went off along the Rue Saint Honor\u00E9, pushing a\r\nbarrow of carrots and cauliflowers before him. Florent followed him, in\r\nthe hope that he would guide him out of the mob. The pavement was now\r\nquite slippery, although the weather was dry, and the litter of\r\nartichoke stalks, turnip tops, and leaves of all kinds made walking\r\nsomewhat dangerous. Florent stumbled at almost every step. He lost\r\nsight of Lacaille in the Rue Vauvilliers, and on approaching the corn\r\nmarket he again found the streets barricaded with vehicles. Then he\r\nmade no further attempt to struggle; he was once more in the clutch of\r\nthe markets, and their stream of life bore him back. Slowly retracing\r\nhis steps, he presently found himself by Saint Eustache again.\r\n\r\nHe now heard the loud continuous rumbling of the waggons that were\r\nsetting out from the markets. Paris was doling out the daily food of\r\nits two million inhabitants. These markets were like some huge central\r\norgan beating with giant force, and sending the blood of life through\r\nevery vein of the city. The uproar was akin to that of colossal jaws\u2014a\r\nmighty sound to which each phase of the provisioning contributed, from\r\nthe whip-cracking of the larger retail dealers as they started off for\r\nthe district markets to the dragging pit-a-pat of the old shoes worn by\r\nthe poor women who hawked their lettuces in baskets from door to door.\r\n\r\nFlorent turned into a covered way on the left, intersecting the group\r\nof four pavilions whose deep silent gloom he had remarked during the\r\nnight. He hoped that he might there find a refuge, discover some corner\r\nin which he could hide himself. But these pavilions were now as busy,\r\nas lively as the others. Florent walked on to the end of the street.\r\nDrays were driving up at a quick trot, crowding the market with cages\r\nfull of live poultry, and square hampers in which dead birds were\r\nstowed in deep layers. On the other side of the way were other drays\r\nfrom which porters were removing freshly killed calves, wrapped in\r\ncanvas, and laid at full length in baskets, whence only the four\r\nbleeding stumps of their legs protruded. There were also whole sheep,\r\nand sides and quarters of beef. Butchers in long white aprons marked\r\nthe meat with a stamp, carried it off, weighted it, and hung it up on\r\nhooks in the auction room. Florent, with his face close to the grating,\r\nstood gazing at the rows of hanging carcasses, at the ruddy sheep and\r\noxen and paler calves, all streaked with yellow fat and sinews, and\r\nwith bellies yawning open. Then he passed along the sidewalk where the\r\ntripe market was held, amidst the pallid calves\u2019 feet and heads, the\r\nrolled tripe neatly packed in boxes, the brains delicately set out in\r\nflat baskets, the sanguineous livers, and purplish kidneys. He checked\r\nhis steps in front of some long two-wheeled carts, covered with round\r\nawnings, and containing sides of pork hung on each side of the vehicle\r\nover a bed of straw. Seen from the back end, the interiors of the carts\r\nlooked like recesses of some tabernacle, like some taper-lighted\r\nchapel, such was the glow of all the bare flesh they contained. And on\r\nthe beds of straw were lines of tin cans, full of the blood that had\r\ntrickled from the pigs. Thereupon Florent was attacked by a sort of\r\nrage. The insipid odour of the meat, the pungent smell of the tripe\r\nexasperated him. He made his way out of the covered road, preferring to\r\nreturn once more to the footwalk of the Rue de Pont Neuf.\r\n\r\nHe was enduring perfect agony. The shiver of early morning came upon\r\nhim; his teeth chattered, and he was afraid of falling to the ground\r\nand finding himself unable to rise again. He looked about, but could\r\nsee no vacant place on any bench. Had he found one he would have\r\ndropped asleep there, even at the risk of being awakened by the police.\r\nThen, as giddiness nearly blinded him, he leaned for support against a\r\ntree, with his eyes closed and his ears ringing. The raw carrot, which\r\nhe had swallowed almost without chewing, was torturing his stomach, and\r\nthe glass of punch which he had drunk seemed to have intoxicated him.\r\nHe was indeed intoxicated with misery, weariness, and hunger. Again he\r\nfelt a burning fire in the pit of the stomach, to which he every now\r\nand then carried his hands, as though he were trying to stop up a hole\r\nthrough which all his life was oozing away. As he stood there he\r\nfancied that the foot-pavement rocked beneath him; and thinking that he\r\nmight perhaps lessen his sufferings by walking, he went straight on\r\nthrough the vegetables again. He lost himself among them. He went along\r\na narrow footway, turned down another, was forced to retrace his steps,\r\nbungled in doing so, and once more found himself amidst piles of\r\ngreenery. Some heaps were so high that people seemed to be walking\r\nbetween walls of bundles and bunches. Only their heads slightly\r\novertopped these ramparts, and passed along showing whitely or blackly\r\naccording to the colour of their hats or caps; whilst the huge swinging\r\nbaskets, carried aloft on a level with the greenery, looked like osier\r\nboats floating on a stagnant, mossy lake.\r\n\r\nFlorent stumbled against a thousand obstacles\u2014against porters taking up\r\ntheir burdens, and saleswomen disputing in rough tones. He slipped over\r\nthe thick bed of waste leaves and stumps which covered the footway, and\r\nwas almost suffocated by the powerful odour of crushed verdure. At last\r\nhe halted in a sort of confused stupor, and surrendered to the pushing\r\nof some and the insults of others; and then he became a mere waif, a\r\npiece of wreckage tossed about on the surface of that surging sea.\r\n\r\nHe was fast losing all self-respect, and would willingly have begged.\r\nThe recollection of his foolish pride during the night exasperated him.\r\nIf he had accepted Madame Francois\u2019s charity, if he had not felt such\r\nidiotic fear of Claude, he would not now have been stranded there\r\ngroaning in the midst of these cabbages. And he was especially angry\r\nwith himself for not having questioned the artist when they were in the\r\nRue Pirouette. Now, alas! he was alone and deserted, liable to die in\r\nthe streets like a homeless dog.\r\n\r\nFor the last time he raised his eyes and looked at the markets. At\r\npresent they were glittering in the sun. A broad ray was pouring\r\nthrough the covered road from the far end, cleaving the massy pavilions\r\nwith an arcade of light, whilst fiery beams rained down upon the far\r\nexpanse of roofs. The huge iron framework grew less distinct, assumed a\r\nbluey hue, became nothing but a shadowy silhouette outlined against the\r\nflaming flare of the sunrise. But up above a pane of glass took fire,\r\ndrops of light trickled down the broad sloping zinc plates to the\r\ngutterings; and then, below, a tumultuous city appeared amidst a haze\r\nof dancing golden dust. The general awakening had spread, from the\r\nfirst start of the market gardeners snoring in their cloaks, to the\r\nbrisk rolling of the food-laden railway drays. And the whole city was\r\nopening its iron gates, the footways were humming, the pavilions\r\nroaring with life. Shouts and cries of all kinds rent the air; it was\r\nas though the strain, which Florent had heard gathering force in the\r\ngloom ever since four in the morning, had now attained its fullest\r\nvolume. To the right and left, on all sides indeed, the sharp cries\r\naccompanying the auction sales sounded shrilly like flutes amidst the\r\nsonorous bass roar of the crowd. It was the fish, the butter, the\r\npoultry, and the meat being sold.\r\n\r\nThe pealing of bells passed through the air, imparting a quiver to the\r\nbuzzing of the opening markets. Around Florent the sun was setting the\r\nvegetables aflame. He no longer perceived any of those soft\r\nwater-colour tints which had predominated in the pale light of early\r\nmorning. The swelling hearts of the lettuces were now gleaming\r\nbrightly, the scales of greenery showed forth with wondrous vigour, the\r\ncarrots glowed blood-red, the turnips shone as if incandescent in the\r\ntriumphant radiance of the sun.\r\n\r\nOn Florent\u2019s left some waggons were discharging fresh loads of\r\ncabbages. He turned his eyes, and away in the distance saw carts yet\r\nstreaming out of the Rue Turbigo. The tide was still and ever rising.\r\nHe had felt it about his ankles, then on a level with his stomach, and\r\nnow it was threatening to drown him altogether. Blinded and submerged,\r\nhis ears buzzing, his stomach overpowered by all that he had seen, he\r\nasked for mercy; and wild grief took possession of him at the thought\r\nof dying there of starvation in the very heart of glutted Paris, amidst\r\nthe effulgent awakening of her markets. Big hot tears started from his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nWalking on, he had now reached one of the larger alleys. Two women, one\r\nshort and old, the other tall and withered, passed him, talking\r\ntogether as they made their way towards the pavilions.\r\n\r\n\u201CSo you\u2019ve come to do your marketing, Mademoiselle Saget?\u201D said the\r\ntall withered woman.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, yes, Madame Lec\u0153ur, if you can give it such a name as marketing.\r\nI\u2019m a lone woman, you know, and live on next to nothing. I should have\r\nliked a small cauliflower, but everything is so dear. How is butter\r\nselling to-day?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAt thirty-four sous. I have some which is first rate. Will you come\r\nand look at it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I don\u2019t know if I shall want any to-day; I\u2019ve still a little\r\nlard left.\u201D\r\n\r\nMaking a supreme effort, Florent followed these two women. He\r\nrecollected having heard Claude name the old one\u2014Mademoiselle\r\nSaget\u2014when they were in the Rue Pirouette; and he made up his mind to\r\nquestion her when she should have parted from her tall withered\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd how\u2019s your niece?\u201D Mademoiselle Saget now asked.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, La Sarriette does as she likes,\u201D Madame Lec\u0153ur replied in a bitter\r\ntone. \u201CShe\u2019s chosen to set up for herself and her affairs no longer\r\nconcern me. When her lovers have beggared her, she needn\u2019t come to me\r\nfor any bread.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you were so good to her, too! She ought to do well this year;\r\nfruit is yielding big profits. And your brother-in-law, how is he?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, he\u2014\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur bit her lips, and seemed disinclined to say anything\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\u201CStill the same as ever, I suppose?\u201D continued Mademoiselle Saget.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s a very worthy man. Still, I once heard it said that he spent his\r\nmoney in such a way that\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut does anyone know how he spends his money?\u201D interrupted Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur, with much asperity. \u201CHe\u2019s a miserly niggard, a scurvy fellow,\r\nthat\u2019s what I say! Do you know, mademoiselle, he\u2019d see me die of\r\nstarvation rather than lend me five francs! He knows quite well that\r\nthere\u2019s nothing to be made out of butter this season, any more than out\r\nof cheese and eggs; whereas he can sell as much poultry as ever he\r\nchooses. But not once, I assure you, not once has he offered to help\r\nme. I am too proud, as you know, to accept any assistance from him;\r\nstill it would have pleased me to have had it offered.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, by the way, there he is, your brother-in-law!\u201D suddenly exclaimed\r\nMademoiselle Saget, lowering her voice.\r\n\r\nThe two women turned and gazed at a man who was crossing the road to\r\nenter the covered way close by.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m in a hurry,\u201D murmured Madame Lec\u0153ur. \u201CI left my stall without\r\nanyone to look after it; and, besides, I don\u2019t want to speak to him.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, Florent also had mechanically turned round and glanced at the\r\nindividual referred to. This was a short, squarely-built man, with a\r\ncheery look and grey, close-cut brush-like hair. Under each arm he was\r\ncarrying a fat goose, whose head hung down and flapped against his\r\nlegs. And then all at once Florent made a gesture of delight.\r\nForgetting his fatigue, he ran after the man, and, overtaking him,\r\ntapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201CGavard!\u201D he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe other raised his head and stared with surprise at Florent\u2019s tall\r\nblack figure, which he did not at first recognise. Then all at once:\r\n\u201CWhat! is it you?\u201D he cried, as if overcome with amazement. \u201CIs it\r\nreally you?\u201D\r\n\r\nHe all but let his geese fall, and seemed unable to master his\r\nsurprise. On catching sight, however, of his sister-in-law and\r\nMademoiselle Saget, who were watching the meeting at a distance, he\r\nbegan to walk on again.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome along; don\u2019t let us stop here,\u201D he said. \u201CThere are too many eyes\r\nand tongues about.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen they were in the covered way they began to chat. Florent related\r\nhow he had gone to the Rue Pirouette, at which Gavard seemed much\r\namused and laughed heartily. Then he told Florent that his brother\r\nQuenu had moved from that street and had reopened his pork shop close\r\nby, in the Rue Rambuteau, just in front of the markets. And afterwards\r\nhe was again highly amused to hear that Florent had been wandering\r\nabout all that morning with Claude Lantier, an odd kind of fish, who,\r\nstrangely enough, said he, was Madame Quenu\u2019s nephew. Thus chatting,\r\nGavard was on the point of taking Florent straight to the pork shop,\r\nbut, on hearing that he had returned to France with false papers, he\r\nsuddenly assumed all sorts of solemn and mysterious airs, and insisted\r\nupon walking some fifteen paces in front of him, to avoid attracting\r\nattention. After passing through the poultry pavilion, where he hung\r\nhis geese up in his stall, he began to cross the Rue Rambuteau, still\r\nfollowed by Florent; and then, halting in the middle of the road, he\r\nglanced significantly towards a large and well-appointed pork shop.\r\n\r\nThe sun was obliquely enfilading the Rue Rambuteau, lighting up the\r\nfronts of the houses, in the midst of which the Rue Pirouette formed a\r\ndark gap. At the other end the great pile of Saint Eustache glittered\r\nbrightly in the sunlight like some huge reliquary. And right through\r\nthe crowd, from the distant crossway, an army of street-sweepers was\r\nadvancing in file down the road, the brooms swishing rhythmically,\r\nwhile scavengers provided with forks pitched the collected refuse into\r\ntumbrels, which at intervals of a score of paces halted with a noise\r\nlike the chattering of broken pots. However, all Florent\u2019s attention\r\nwas concentrated on the pork shop, open and radiant in the rising sun.\r\n\r\nIt stood very near the corner of the Rue Pirouette and provided quite a\r\nfeast for the eyes. Its aspect was bright and smiling, touches of\r\nbrilliant colour showing conspicuously amidst all the snowy marble. The\r\nsign board, on which the name of QUENU-GRADELLE glittered in fat gilt\r\nletters encircled by leaves and branches painted on a soft-hued\r\nbackground, was protected by a sheet of glass. On two panels, one on\r\neach side of the shop-front, and both, like the board above, covered\r\nwith glass, were paintings representing various chubby little cupids\r\nplaying amidst boars\u2019 heads, pork chops and strings of sausages; and\r\nthese latter still-life subjects, embellished with scrolls and bows,\r\nhad been painted in such soft tones that the uncooked pork which they\r\nrepresented had the pinkiness of raspberry jam. Within this pleasing\r\nframework arose the window display, arranged upon a bed of fine\r\nblue-paper shavings. Here and there fern-leaves, tastefully disposed,\r\nchanged the plates which they encircled into bouquets fringed with\r\nfoliage. There was a wealth of rich, luscious, melting things. Down\r\nbelow, quite close to the window, jars of preserved sausage-meat were\r\ninterspersed with pots of mustard. Above these were some small, plump,\r\nboned hams. Golden with their dressings of toasted bread-crumbs, and\r\nadorned at the knuckles with green rosettes. Next came the larger\r\ndishes, some containing preserved Strasburg tongues, enclosed in\r\nbladders coloured a bright red and varnished, so that they looked quite\r\nsanguineous beside the pale sausages and trotters; then there were\r\nblack-puddings coiled like harmless snakes, healthy looking\r\nchitterlings piled up two by two; Lyons sausages in little silver copes\r\nthat made them look like choristers; hot pies, with little banner-like\r\ntickets stuck in them; big hams, and great glazed joints of veal and\r\npork, whose jelly was as limpid as sugar-candy. In the rear were other\r\ndishes and earthen pans in which meat, minced and sliced, slumbered\r\nbeneath lakes of melted fat. And betwixt the various plates and dishes,\r\njars and bottle of sauce, cullis, stock and preserved truffles, pans of\r\n_foie gras_ and boxes of sardines and tunny-fish were strewn over the\r\nbed of paper shavings. A box of creamy cheeses, and one of edible\r\nsnails, the apertures of whose shells were dressed with butter and\r\nparsley, had been placed carelessly at either corner. Finally, from a\r\nbar overhead strings of sausages and saveloys of various sizes hung\r\ndown symmetrically like cords and tassels; while in the rear fragments\r\nof intestinal membranes showed like lacework, like some _guipure_ of\r\nwhite flesh. And on the highest tier in this sanctuary of gluttony,\r\namidst the membranes and between two bouquets of purple gladioli, the\r\nwindow stand was crowned by a small square aquarium, ornamented with\r\nrock-work, and containing a couple of gold-fish, which were continually\r\nswimming round it.\r\n\r\nFlorent\u2019s whole body thrilled at the sight. Then he perceived a woman\r\nstanding in the sunlight at the door of the shop. With her prosperous,\r\nhappy look in the midst of all those inviting things she added to the\r\ncherry aspect of the place. She was a fine woman and quite blocked the\r\ndoorway. Still, she was not over stout, but simply buxom, with the full\r\nripeness of her thirty years. She had only just risen, yet her glossy\r\nhair was already brushed smooth and arranged in little flat bands over\r\nher temples, giving her an appearance of extreme neatness. She had the\r\nfine skin, the pinky-white complexion common to those whose life is\r\nspent in an atmosphere of raw meat and fat. There was a touch of\r\ngravity about her demeanour, her movements were calm and slow; what\r\nmirth or pleasure she felt she expressed by her eyes, her lips\r\nretaining all their seriousness. A collar of starched linen encircled\r\nher neck, white sleevelets reached to her elbows, and a white apron\r\nfell even over the tips of her shoes, so that you saw but little of her\r\nblack cashmere dress, which clung tightly to her well-rounded shoulders\r\nand swelling bosom. The sun rays poured hotly upon all the whiteness\r\nshe displayed. However, although her bluish-black hair, her rosy face,\r\nand bright sleeves and apron were steeped in the glow of light, she\r\nnever once blinked, but enjoyed her morning bath of sunshine with\r\nblissful tranquillity, her soft eyes smiling the while at the flow and\r\nriot of the markets. She had the appearance of a very worthy woman.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is your brother\u2019s wife, your sister-in-law, Lisa,\u201D Gavard said to\r\nFlorent.\r\n\r\nHe had saluted her with a slight inclination of the head. Then he\r\ndarted along the house passage, continuing to take the most minute\r\nprecautions, and unwilling to let Florent enter the premises through\r\nthe shop, though there was no one there. It was evident that he felt\r\ngreat pleasure in dabbling in what he considered to be a compromising\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\u201CWait here,\u201D he said, \u201Cwhile I go to see whether your brother is alone.\r\nYou can come in when I clap my hands.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon he opened a door at the end of the passage. But as soon as\r\nFlorent heard his brother\u2019s voice behind it, he sprang inside at a\r\nbound. Quenu, who was much attached to him, threw his arms round his\r\nneck, and they kissed each other like children.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! dash it all! Is it really you, my dear fellow?\u201D stammered the pork\r\nbutcher. \u201CI never expected to see you again. I felt sure you were dead!\r\nWhy, only yesterday I was saying to Lisa, \u2018That poor fellow, Florent!\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, he stopped short, and popping his head into the shop, called\r\nout, \u201CLisa! Lisa!\u201D Then turning towards a little girl who had crept\r\ninto a corner, he added, \u201CPauline, go and find your mother.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe little one did not stir, however. She was an extremely fine child,\r\nfive years of age, with a plump chubby face, bearing a strong\r\nresemblance to that of the pork butcher\u2019s wife. In her arms she was\r\nholding a huge yellow cat, which had cheerfully surrendered itself to\r\nher embrace, with its legs dangling downwards; and she now squeezed it\r\ntightly with her little arms, as if she were afraid that yonder\r\nshabby-looking gentleman might rob her of it.\r\n\r\nLisa, however, leisurely made her appearance.\r\n\r\n\u201CHere is my brother Florent!\u201D exclaimed Quenu.\r\n\r\nLisa addressed him as \u201CMonsieur,\u201D and gave him a kindly welcome. She\r\nscanned him quietly from head to foot, without evincing any\r\ndisagreeable surprise. Merely a faint pout appeared for a moment on her\r\nlips. Then, standing by, she began to smile at her husband\u2019s\r\ndemonstrations of affection. Quenu, however, at last recovered his\r\ncalmness, and noticing Florent\u2019s fleshless, poverty-stricken\r\nappearance, exclaimed: \u201CAh, my poor fellow, you haven\u2019t improved in\r\nyour looks since you were over yonder. For my part, I\u2019ve grown fat; but\r\nwhat would you have!\u201D\r\n\r\nHe had indeed grown fat, too fat for his thirty years. He seemed to be\r\nbursting through his shirt and apron, through all the snowy-white linen\r\nin which he was swathed like a huge doll. With advancing years his\r\nclean-shaven face had become elongated, assuming a faint resemblance to\r\nthe snout of one of those pigs amidst whose flesh his hands worked and\r\nlived the whole day through. Florent scarcely recognised him. He had\r\nnow seated himself, and his glance turned from his brother to handsome\r\nLisa and little Pauline. They were all brimful of health, squarely\r\nbuilt, sleek, in prime condition; and in their turn they looked at\r\nFlorent with the uneasy astonishment which corpulent people feel at the\r\nsight of a scraggy person. The very cat, whose skin was distended by\r\nfat, dilated its yellow eyes and scrutinised him with an air of\r\ndistrust.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll wait till we have breakfast, won\u2019t you?\u201D asked Quenu. \u201CWe have\r\nit early, at ten o\u2019clock.\u201D\r\n\r\nA penetrating odour of cookery pervaded the place; and Florent looked\r\nback upon the terrible night which he had just spent, his arrival\r\namongst the vegetables, his agony in the midst of the markets, the\r\nendless avalanches of food from which he had just escaped. And then in\r\na low tone and with a gentle smile he responded:\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; I\u2019m really very hungry, you see.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorent had just begun to study law in Paris when his mother died. She\r\nlived at Le Vigan, in the department of the Gard, and had taken for her\r\nsecond husband one Quenu, a native of Yvetot in Normandy, whom some\r\nsub-prefect had transplanted to the south and then forgotten there. He\r\nhad remained in employment at the sub-prefecture, finding the country\r\ncharming, the wine good, and the women very amiable. Three years after\r\nhis marriage he had been carried off by a bad attack of indigestion,\r\nleaving as sole legacy to his wife a sturdy boy who resembled him. It\r\nwas only with very great difficulty that the widow could pay the\r\ncollege fees of Florent, her elder son, the issue of her first\r\nmarriage. He was a very gentle youth, devoted to his studies, and\r\nconstantly won the chief prizes at school. It was upon him that his\r\nmother lavished all her affection and based all her hopes. Perhaps, in\r\nbestowing so much love on this slim pale youth, she was giving evidence\r\nof her preference for her first husband, a tender-hearted, caressing\r\nProven\u00E7al, who had loved her devotedly. Quenu, whose good humour and\r\namiability had at first attracted her, had perhaps displayed too much\r\nself-satisfaction, and shown too plainly that he looked upon himself as\r\nthe main source of happiness. At all events she formed the opinion that\r\nher younger son\u2014and in southern families younger sons are still often\r\nsacrificed\u2014would never do any good; so she contented herself with\r\nsending him to a school kept by a neighbouring old maid, where the lad\r\nlearned nothing but how to idle his time away. The two brothers grew up\r\nfar apart from each other, as though they were strangers.\r\n\r\nWhen Florent arrived at Le Vigan his mother was already buried. She had\r\ninsisted upon having her illness concealed from him till the very last\r\nmoment, for fear of disturbing his studies. Thus he found little Quenu,\r\nwho was then twelve years old, sitting and sobbing alone on a table in\r\nthe middle of the kitchen. A furniture dealer, a neighbour, gave him\r\nparticulars of his mother\u2019s last hours. She had reached the end of her\r\nresources, had killed herself by the hard work which she had undertaken\r\nto earn sufficient money that her elder son might continue his legal\r\nstudies. To her modest trade in ribbons, the profits of which were but\r\nsmall, she had been obliged to add other occupations, which kept her up\r\nvery late at night. Her one idea of seeing Florent established as an\r\nadvocate, holding a good position in the town, had gradually caused her\r\nto become hard and miserly, without pity for either herself or others.\r\nLittle Quenu was allowed to wander about in ragged breeches, and in\r\nblouses from which the sleeves were falling away. He never dared to\r\nserve himself at table, but waited till he received his allowance of\r\nbread from his mother\u2019s hands. She gave herself equally thin slices,\r\nand it was to the effects of this regimen that she had succumbed, in\r\ndeep despair at having failed to accomplish her self-allotted task.\r\n\r\nThis story made a most painful impression upon Florent\u2019s tender nature,\r\nand his sobs wellnigh choked him. He took his little half brother in\r\nhis arms, held him to his breast, and kissed him as though to restore\r\nto him the love of which he had unwittingly deprived him. Then he\r\nlooked at the lad\u2019s gaping shoes, torn sleeves, and dirty hands, at all\r\nthe manifest signs of wretchedness and neglect. And he told him that he\r\nwould take him away, and that they would both live happily together.\r\nThe next day, when he began to inquire into affairs, he felt afraid\r\nthat he would not be able to keep sufficient money to pay for the\r\njourney back to Paris. However, he was determined to leave Le Vigan at\r\nany cost. He was fortunately able to sell the little ribbon business,\r\nand this enabled him to discharge his mother\u2019s debts, for despite her\r\nstrictness in money matters she had gradually run up bills. Then, as\r\nthere was nothing left, his mother\u2019s neighbour, the furniture dealer,\r\noffered him five hundred francs for her chattels and stock of linen. It\r\nwas a very good bargain for the dealer, but the young man thanked him\r\nwith tears in his eyes. He bought his brother some new clothes, and\r\ntook him away that same evening.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Paris he gave up all thought of continuing to attend\r\nthe Law School, and postponed every ambitious project. He obtained a\r\nfew pupils, and established himself with little Quenu in the Rue Royer\r\nCollard, at the corner of the Rue Saint Jacques, in a big room which he\r\nfurnished with two iron bedsteads, a wardrobe, a table, and four\r\nchairs. He now had a child to look after, and this assumed paternity\r\nwas very pleasing to him. During the earlier days he attempted to give\r\nthe lad some lessons when he returned home in the evening, but Quenu\r\nwas an unwilling pupil. He was dull of understanding, and refused to\r\nlearn, bursting into tears and regretfully recalling the time when his\r\nmother had allowed him to run wild in the streets. Florent thereupon\r\nstopped his lessons in despair, and to console the lad promised him a\r\nholiday of indefinite length. As an excuse for his own weakness he\r\nrepeated that he had not brought his brother to Paris to distress him.\r\nTo see him grow up in happiness became his chief desire. He quite\r\nworshipped the boy, was charmed with his merry laughter, and felt\r\ninfinite joy in seeing him about him, healthy and vigorous, and without\r\na care. Florent for his part remained very slim and lean in his\r\nthreadbare coat, and his face began to turn yellow amidst all the\r\ndrudgery and worry of teaching; but Quenu grew up plump and merry, a\r\nlittle dense, indeed, and scarce able to read or write, but endowed\r\nwith high spirits which nothing could ruffle, and which filled the big\r\ngloomy room in the Rue Royer Collard with gaiety.\r\n\r\nYears, meantime, passed by. Florent, who had inherited all his mother\u2019s\r\nspirit of devotion, kept Quenu at home as though he were a big, idle\r\ngirl. He did not even suffer him to perform any petty domestic duties,\r\nbut always went to buy the provisions himself, and attended to the\r\ncooking and other necessary matters. This kept him, he said, from\r\nindulging in his own bad thoughts. He was given to gloominess, and\r\nfancied that he was disposed to evil. When he returned home in the\r\nevening, splashed with mud, and his head bowed by the annoyances to\r\nwhich other people\u2019s children had subjected him, his heart melted\r\nbeneath the embrace of the sturdy lad whom he found spinning his top on\r\nthe tiled flooring of the big room. Quenu laughed at his brother\u2019s\r\nclumsiness in making omelettes, and at the serious fashion in which he\r\nprepared the soup-beef and vegetables. When the lamp was extinguished,\r\nand Florent lay in bed, he sometimes gave way to feelings of sadness.\r\nHe longed to resume his legal studies, and strove to map out his duties\r\nin such wise as to secure time to follow the programme of the faculty.\r\nHe succeeded in doing this, and was then perfectly happy. But a slight\r\nattack of fever, which confined him to his room for a week, made such a\r\nhole in his purse, and caused him so much alarm, that he abandoned all\r\nidea of completing his studies. The boy was now getting a big fellow,\r\nand Florent took a post as teacher in a school in the Rue de\r\nl\u2019Estrapade, at a salary of eighteen hundred francs per annum. This\r\nseemed like a fortune to him. By dint of economy he hoped to be able to\r\namass a sum of money which would set Quenu going in the world. When the\r\nlad reached his eighteenth year Florent still treated him as though he\r\nwere a daughter for whom a dowry must be provided.\r\n\r\nHowever, during his brother\u2019s brief illness Quenu himself had made\r\ncertain reflections. One morning he proclaimed his desire to work,\r\nsaying that he was now old enough to earn his own living. Florent was\r\ndeeply touched at this. Just opposite, on the other side of the street,\r\nlived a working watchmaker whom Quenu, through the curtainless window,\r\ncould see leaning over a little table, manipulating all sorts of\r\ndelicate things, and patiently gazing at them through a magnifying\r\nglass all day long. The lad was much attracted by the sight, and\r\ndeclared that he had a taste for watchmaking. At the end of a\r\nfortnight, however, he became restless, and began to cry like a child\r\nof ten, complaining that the work was too complicated, and that he\r\nwould never be able to understand all the silly little things that\r\nenter into the construction of a watch.\r\n\r\nHis next whim was to be a locksmith; but this calling he found too\r\nfatiguing. In a couple of years he tried more than ten different\r\ntrades. Florent opined that he acted rightly, that it was wrong to take\r\nup a calling one did not like. However, Quenu\u2019s fine eagerness to work\r\nfor his living strained the resources of the little establishment very\r\nseriously. Since he had begun flitting from one workshop to another\r\nthere had been a constant succession of fresh expenses; money had gone\r\nin new clothes, in meals taken away from home, and in the payment of\r\nfootings among fellow workmen. Florent\u2019s salary of eighteen hundred\r\nfrancs was no longer sufficient, and he was obliged to take a couple of\r\npupils in the evenings. For eight years he had continued to wear the\r\nsame old coat.\r\n\r\nHowever, the two brothers had made a friend. One side of the house in\r\nwhich they lived overlooked the Rue Saint Jacques, where there was a\r\nlarge poultry-roasting establishment[*] kept by a worthy man called\r\nGavard, whose wife was dying from consumption amidst an atmosphere\r\nredolent of plump fowls. When Florent returned home too late to cook a\r\nscrap of meat, he was in the habit of laying out a dozen sous or so on\r\na small portion of turkey or goose at this shop. Such days were feast\r\ndays. Gavard in time grew interested in this tall, scraggy customer,\r\nlearned his history, and invited Quenu into his shop. Before long the\r\nyoung fellow was constantly to be found there. As soon as his brother\r\nleft the house he came downstairs and installed himself at the rear of\r\nthe roasting shop, quite enraptured with the four huge spits which\r\nturned with a gentle sound in front of the tall bright flames.\r\n\r\n[*] These rotisseries, now all but extinct, were at one time a\r\nparticular feature of the Parisian provision trade. I can myself\r\nrecollect several akin to the one described by M. Zola. I suspect that\r\nthey largely owed their origin to the form and dimensions of the\r\nordinary Parisian kitchen stove, which did not enable people to roast\r\npoultry at home in a convenient way. In the old French cuisine,\r\nmoreover, roast joints of meat were virtually unknown; roasting was\r\nalmost entirely confined to chickens, geese, turkeys, pheasants, etc.;\r\nand among the middle classes people largely bought their poultry\r\nalready cooked of the _rotisseur_, or else confided it to him for the\r\npurpose of roasting, in the same way as our poorer classes still send\r\ntheir joints to the baker\u2019s. Roasting was also long looked upon in\r\nFrance as a very delicate art. Brillat-Savarin, in his famous\r\n_Physiologie du Gout_, lays down the dictum that \u201CA man may become a\r\ncook, but is born a _rotisseur_.\u201D\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broad copper bands of the fireplace glistened brightly, the poultry\r\nsteamed, the fat bubbled melodiously in the dripping-pan, and the spits\r\nseemed to talk amongst themselves and to address kindly words to Quenu,\r\nwho, with a long ladle, devoutly basted the golden breasts of the fat\r\ngeese and turkeys. He would stay there for hours, quite crimson in the\r\ndancing glow of the flames, and laughing vaguely, with a somewhat\r\nstupid expression, at the birds roasting in front of him. Indeed, he\r\ndid not awake from this kind of trance until the geese and turkeys were\r\nunspitted. They were placed on dishes, the spits emerged from their\r\ncarcasses smoking hot, and a rich gravy flowed from either end and\r\nfilled the shop with a penetrating odour. Then the lad, who, standing\r\nup, had eagerly followed every phase of the dishing, would clap his\r\nhands and begin to talk to the birds, telling them that they were very\r\nnice, and would be eaten up, and that the cats would have nothing but\r\ntheir bones. And he would give a start of delight whenever Gavard\r\nhanded him a slice of bread, which he forthwith put into the\r\ndripping-pan that it might soak and toast there for half an hour.\r\n\r\nIt was in this shop, no doubt, that Quenu\u2019s love of cookery took its\r\nbirth. Later on, when he had tried all sorts of crafts, he returned, as\r\nthough driven by fate, to the spits and the poultry and the savoury\r\ngravy which induces one to lick one\u2019s fingers. At first he was afraid\r\nof vexing his brother, who was a small eater and spoke of good fare\r\nwith the disdain of a man who is ignorant of it; but afterwards, on\r\nseeing that Florent listened to him when he explained the preparation\r\nof some very elaborate dish, he confessed his desires and presently\r\nfound a situation at a large restaurant. From that time forward the\r\nlife of the two brothers was settled. They continued to live in the\r\nroom in the Rue Royer Collard, whither they returned every evening; the\r\none glowing and radiant from his hot fire, the other with the depressed\r\ncountenance of a shabby, impecunious teacher. Florent still wore his\r\nold black coat, as he sat absorbed in correcting his pupils\u2019 exercises;\r\nwhile Quenu, to put himself more at ease, donned his white apron, cap,\r\nand jacket, and, flitting about in front of the stove, amused himself\r\nby baking some dainty in the oven. Sometimes they smiled at seeing\r\nthemselves thus attired, the one all in black, the other all in white.\r\nThese different garbs, one bright and the other sombre, seemed to make\r\nthe big room half gay and half mournful. Never, however, was there so\r\nmuch harmony in a household marked by such dissimilarity. Though the\r\nelder brother grew thinner and thinner, consumed by the ardent\r\ntemperament which he had inherited from his Proven\u00E7al father, and the\r\nyounger one waxed fatter and fatter like a true son of Normandy, they\r\nloved each other in the brotherhood they derived from their mother\u2014a\r\nmother who had been all devotion.\r\n\r\nThey had a relation in Paris, a brother of their mother\u2019s, one\r\nGradelle, who was in business as a pork butcher in the Rue Pirouette,\r\nnear the central markets. He was a fat, hard-hearted, miserly fellow,\r\nand received his nephews as though they were starving paupers the first\r\ntime they paid him a visit. They seldom went to see him afterwards. On\r\nhis nameday Quenu would take him a bunch of flowers, and receive a\r\nhalf-franc piece in return for it. Florent\u2019s proud and sensitive nature\r\nsuffered keenly when Gradelle scrutinised his shabby clothes with the\r\nanxious, suspicious glance of a miser apprehending a request for a\r\ndinner, or the loan of a five-franc piece. One day, however, it\r\noccurred to Florent in all artlessness to ask his uncle to change a\r\nhundred-franc note for him, and after this the pork butcher showed less\r\nalarm at sight of the lads, as he called them. Still, their friendship\r\ngot no further than these infrequent visits.\r\n\r\nThese years were like a long, sweet, sad dream to Florent. As they\r\npassed he tasted to the full all the bitter joys of self-sacrifice. At\r\nhome, in the big room, life was all love and tenderness; but out in the\r\nworld, amidst the humiliations inflicted on him by his pupils, and the\r\nrough jostling of the streets, he felt himself yielding to wicked\r\nthoughts. His slain ambitions embittered him. It was long before he\r\ncould bring himself to bow to his fate, and accept with equanimity the\r\npainful lot of a poor, plain, commonplace man. At last, to guard\r\nagainst the temptations of wickedness, he plunged into ideal goodness,\r\nand sought refuge in a self-created sphere of absolute truth and\r\njustice. It was then that he became a republican, entering into the\r\nrepublican idea even as heart-broken girls enter a convent. And not\r\nfinding a republic where sufficient peace and kindliness prevailed to\r\nlull his troubles to sleep, he created one for himself. He took no\r\npleasure in books. All the blackened paper amidst which he lived spoke\r\nof evil-smelling class-rooms, of pellets of paper chewed by unruly\r\nschoolboys, of long, profitless hours of torture. Besides, books only\r\nsuggested to him a spirit of mutiny and pride, whereas it was of peace\r\nand oblivion that he felt most need. To lull and soothe himself with\r\nthe ideal imaginings, to dream that he was perfectly happy, and that\r\nall the world would likewise become so, to erect in his brain the\r\nrepublican city in which he would fain have lived, such now became his\r\nrecreation, the task, again and again renewed, of all his leisure\r\nhours. He no longer read any books beyond those which his duties\r\ncompelled him to peruse; he preferred to tramp along the Rue Saint\r\nJacques as far as the outer boulevards, occasionally going yet a\r\ngreater distance and returning by the Barriere d\u2019Italie; and all along\r\nthe road, with his eyes on the Quartier Mouffetard spread out at his\r\nfeet, he would devise reforms of great moral and humanitarian scope,\r\nsuch as he thought would change that city of suffering into an abode of\r\nbliss. During the turmoil of February 1848, when Paris was stained with\r\nblood he became quite heartbroken, and rushed from one to another of\r\nthe public clubs demanding that the blood which had been shed should\r\nfind atonement in \u201Cthe fraternal embrace of all republicans throughout\r\nthe world.\u201D He became one of those enthusiastic orators who preached\r\nrevolution as a new religion, full of gentleness and salvation. The\r\nterrible days of December 1851, the days of the Coup d\u2019Etat, were\r\nrequired to wean him from his doctrines of universal love. He was then\r\nwithout arms; allowed himself to be captured like a sheep, and was\r\ntreated as though he were a wolf. He awoke from his sermon on universal\r\nbrotherhood to find himself starving on the cold stones of a casemate\r\nat Bic\u00EAtre.\r\n\r\nQuenu, when two and twenty, was distressed with anguish when his\r\nbrother did not return home. On the following day he went to seek his\r\ncorpse at the cemetery of Montmartre, where the bodies of those shot\r\ndown on the boulevards had been laid out in a line and covered with\r\nstraw, from beneath which only their ghastly heads projected. However,\r\nQuenu\u2019s courage failed him, he was blinded by his tears, and had to\r\npass twice along the line of corpses before acquiring the certainty\r\nthat Florent\u2019s was not among them. At last, at the end of a long and\r\nwretched week, he learned at the Prefecture of Police that his brother\r\nwas a prisoner. He was not allowed to see him, and when he pressed the\r\nmatter the police threatened to arrest him also. Then he hastened off\r\nto his uncle Gradelle, whom he looked upon as a person of importance,\r\nhoping that he might be able to enlist his influence in Florent\u2019s\r\nbehalf. But Gradelle waxed wrathful, declared that Florent deserved his\r\nfate, that he ought to have known better than to have mixed himself up\r\nwith those rascally republicans. And he even added that Florent was\r\ndestined to turn out badly, that it was written on his face.\r\n\r\nQuenu wept copiously and remained there, almost choked by his sobs. His\r\nuncle, a little ashamed of his harshness, and feeling that he ought to\r\ndo something for him, offered to receive him into his house. He wanted\r\nan assistant, and knew that his nephew was a good cook. Quenu was so\r\nmuch alarmed by the mere thought of going back to live alone in the big\r\nroom in the Rue Royer Collard, that then and there he accepted\r\nGradelle\u2019s offer. That same night he slept in his uncle\u2019s house, in a\r\ndark hole of a garret just under the room, where there was scarcely\r\nspace for him to lie at full length. However, he was less wretched\r\nthere than he would have been opposite his brother\u2019s empty couch.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded at length in obtaining permission to see Florent; but on\r\nhis return from Bic\u00EAtre he was obliged to take to his bed. For nearly\r\nthree weeks he lay fever-stricken, in a stupefied, comatose state.\r\nGradelle meantime called down all sorts of maledictions on his\r\nrepublican nephew; and one morning, when he heard of Florent\u2019s\r\ndeparture for Cayenne, he went upstairs, tapped Quenu on the hands,\r\nawoke him, and bluntly told him the news, thereby bringing about such a\r\nreaction that on the following day the young man was up and about\r\nagain. His grief wore itself out, and his soft flabby flesh seemed to\r\nabsorb his tears. A month later he laughed again, and then grew vexed\r\nand unhappy with himself for having been merry; but his natural\r\nlight-heartedness soon gained the mastery, and he laughed afresh in\r\nunconscious happiness.\r\n\r\nHe now learned his uncle\u2019s business, from which he derived even more\r\nenjoyment than from cookery. Gradelle told him, however, that he must\r\nnot neglect his pots and pans, that it was rare to find a pork butcher\r\nwho was also a good cook, and that he had been lucky in serving in a\r\nrestaurant before coming to the shop. Gradelle, moreover, made full use\r\nof his nephew\u2019s acquirements, employed him to cook the dinners sent out\r\nto certain customers, and placed all the broiling, and the preparation\r\nof pork chops garnished with gherkins in his special charge. As the\r\nyoung man was of real service to him, he grew fond of him after his own\r\nfashion, and would nip his plump arms when he was in a good humour.\r\nGradelle had sold the scanty furniture of the room in the Rue Royer\r\nCollard and retained possession of the proceeds\u2014some forty francs or\r\nso\u2014in order, said he, to prevent the foolish lad, Quenu, from making\r\nducks and drakes of the cash. After a time, however, he allowed his\r\nnephew six francs a month a pocket-money.\r\n\r\nQuenu now became quite happy, in spite of the emptiness of his purse\r\nand the harshness with which he was occasionally treated. He liked to\r\nhave life doled out to him; Florent had treated him too much like an\r\nindolent girl. Moreover, he had made a friend at his uncle\u2019s. Gradelle,\r\nwhen his wife died, had been obliged to engage a girl to attend to the\r\nshop, and had taken care to choose a healthy and attractive one,\r\nknowing that a good-looking girl would set off his viands and help to\r\ntempt custom. Amongst his acquaintances was a widow, living in the Rue\r\nCuvier, near the Jardin des Plantes, whose deceased husband had been\r\npostmaster at Plassans, the seat of a sub-prefecture in the south of\r\nFrance. This lady, who lived in a very modest fashion on a small\r\nannuity, had brought with her from Plassans a plump, pretty child, whom\r\nshe treated as her own daughter. Lisa, as the young one was called,\r\nattended upon her with much placidity and serenity of disposition.\r\nSomewhat seriously inclined, she looked quite beautiful when she\r\nsmiled. Indeed, her great charm came from the exquisite manner in which\r\nshe allowed this infrequent smile of hers to escape her. Her eyes then\r\nbecame most caressing, and her habitual gravity imparted inestimable\r\nvalue to these sudden, seductive flashes. The old lady had often said\r\nthat one of Lisa\u2019s smiles would suffice to lure her to perdition.\r\n\r\nWhen the widow died she left all her savings, amounting to some ten\r\nthousand francs, to her adopted daughter. For a week Lisa lived alone\r\nin the Rue Cuvier; it was there that Gradelle came in search of her. He\r\nhad become acquainted with her by often seeing her with her mistress\r\nwhen the latter called on him in the Rue Pirouette; and at the funeral\r\nshe had struck him as having grown so handsome and sturdy that he had\r\nfollowed the hearse all the way to the cemetery, though he had not\r\nintended to do so. As the coffin was being lowered into the grave, he\r\nreflected what a splendid girl she would be for the counter of a pork\r\nbutcher\u2019s shop. He thought the matter over, and finally resolved to\r\noffer her thirty francs a month, with board and lodging. When he made\r\nthis proposal, Lisa asked for twenty-four hours to consider it. Then\r\nshe arrived one morning with a little bundle of clothes, and her ten\r\nthousand francs concealed in the bosom of her dress. A month later the\r\nwhole place belonged to her; she enslaved Gradelle, Quenu, and even the\r\nsmallest kitchen-boy. For his part, Quenu would have cut off his\r\nfingers to please her. When she happened to smile, he remained rooted\r\nto the floor, laughing with delight as he gazed at her.\r\n\r\nLisa was the eldest daughter of the Macquarts of Plassans, and her\r\nfather was still alive.[*] But she said that he was abroad, and never\r\nwrote to him. Sometimes she just dropped a hint that her mother, now\r\ndeceased, had been a hard worker, and that she took after her. She\r\nworked, indeed, very assiduously. However, she sometimes added that the\r\nworthy woman had slaved herself to death in striving to support her\r\nfamily. Then she would speak of the respective duties of husband and\r\nwife in such a practical though modest fashion as to enchant Quenu. He\r\nassured her that he fully shared her ideas. These were that everyone,\r\nman or woman, ought to work for his or her living, that everyone was\r\ncharged with the duty of achieving personal happiness, that great harm\r\nwas done by encouraging habits of idleness, and that the presence of so\r\nmuch misery in the world was greatly due to sloth. This theory of hers\r\nwas a sweeping condemnation of drunkenness, of all the legendary\r\nloafing ways of her father Macquart. But, though she did not know it,\r\nthere was much of Macquart\u2019s nature in herself. She was merely a\r\nsteady, sensible Macquart with a logical desire for comfort, having\r\ngrasped the truth of the proverb that as you make your bed so you lie\r\non it. To sleep in blissful warmth there is no better plan than to\r\nprepare oneself a soft and downy couch; and to the preparation of such\r\na couch she gave all her time and all her thoughts. When no more than\r\nsix years old she had consented to remain quietly on her chair the\r\nwhole day through on condition that she should be rewarded with a cake\r\nin the evening.\r\n\r\n[*] See M. Zola\u2019s novel, _The Fortune of the Rougons_.\u2014Translator\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Gradelle\u2019s establishment Lisa went on leading the calm, methodical\r\nlife which her exquisite smiles illumined. She had not accepted the\r\npork butcher\u2019s offer at random. She reckoned upon finding a guardian in\r\nhim; with the keen scent of those who are born lucky she perhaps\r\nforesaw that the gloomy shop in the Rue Pirouette would bring her the\r\ncomfortable future she dreamed of\u2014a life of healthy enjoyment, and work\r\nwithout fatigue, each hour of which would bring its own reward. She\r\nattended to her counter with the quiet earnestness with which she had\r\nwaited upon the postmaster\u2019s widow; and the cleanliness of her aprons\r\nsoon became proverbial in the neighbourhood. Uncle Gradelle was so\r\ncharmed with this pretty girl that sometimes, as he was stringing his\r\nsausages, he would say to Quenu: \u201CUpon my word, if I weren\u2019t turned\r\nsixty, I think I should be foolish enough to marry her. A wife like\r\nshe\u2019d make is worth her weight in gold to a shopkeeper, my lad.\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu himself was growing still fonder of her, though he laughed\r\nmerrily one day when a neighbour accused him of being in love with\r\nLisa. He was not worried with love-sickness. The two were very good\r\nfriends, however. In the evening they went up to their bedrooms\r\ntogether. Lisa slept in a little chamber adjoining the dark hole which\r\nthe young man occupied. She had made this room of hers quite bright by\r\nhanging it with muslin curtains. The pair would stand together for a\r\nmoment on the landing, holding their candles in their hands, and\r\nchatting as they unlocked their doors. Then, as they closed them, they\r\nsaid in friendly tones:\r\n\r\n\u201CGood night, Mademoiselle Lisa.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood night, Monsieur Quenu.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs Quenu undressed himself he listened to Lisa making her own\r\npreparations. The partition between the two rooms was very thin.\r\n\u201CThere, she is drawing her curtains now,\u201D he would say to himself;\r\n\u201Cwhat can she be doing, I wonder, in front of her chest of drawers? Ah!\r\nshe\u2019s sitting down now and taking off her shoes. Now she\u2019s blown her\r\ncandle out. Well, good night. I must get to sleep\u201D; and at times, when\r\nhe heard her bed creak as she got into it, he would say to himself with\r\na smile, \u201CDash it all! Mademoiselle Lisa is no feather.\u201D This idea\r\nseemed to amuse him, and presently he would fall asleep thinking about\r\nthe hams and salt pork that he had to prepare the next morning.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs went on for a year without causing Lisa a single\r\nblush or Quenu a moment\u2019s embarrassment. When the girl came into the\r\nkitchen in the morning at the busiest moment of the day\u2019s work, they\r\ngrasped hands over the dishes of sausage-meat. Sometimes she helped\r\nhim, holding the skins with her plump fingers while he filled them with\r\nmeat and fat. Sometimes, too, with the tips of their tongues they just\r\ntasted the raw sausage-meat, to see if it was properly seasoned. She\r\nwas able to give Quenu some useful hints, for she knew of many\r\nfavourite southern recipes, with which he experimented with much\r\nsuccess. He was often aware that she was standing behind his shoulder,\r\nprying into the pans. If he wanted a spoon or a dish, she would hand it\r\nto him. The heat of the fire would bring their blood to their skins;\r\nstill, nothing in the world would have induced the young man to cease\r\nstirring the fatty _bouillis_ which were thickening over the fire while\r\nthe girl stood gravely by him, discussing the amount of boiling that\r\nwas necessary. In the afternoon, when the shop lacked customers, they\r\nquietly chatted together for hours at a time. Lisa sat behind the\r\ncounter, leaning back, and knitting in an easy, regular fashion; while\r\nQuenu installed himself on a big oak block, dangling his legs and\r\ntapping his heels against the wood. They got on wonderfully well\r\ntogether, discussing all sorts of subjects, generally cookery, and then\r\nUncle Gradelle and the neighbours. Lisa also amused the young man with\r\nstories, just as though he were a child. She knew some very pretty\r\nones\u2014some miraculous legends, full of lambs and little angels, which\r\nshe narrated in a piping voice, with all her wonted seriousness. If a\r\ncustomer happened to come in, she saved herself the trouble of moving\r\nby asking Quenu to get the required pot of lard or box of snails. And\r\nat eleven o\u2019clock they went slowly up to bed as on the previous night.\r\nAs they closed their doors, they calmly repeated the words:\r\n\r\n\u201CGood night, Mademoiselle Lisa.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood night, Monsieur Quenu.\u201D\r\n\r\nOne morning Uncle Gradelle was struck dead by apoplexy while preparing\r\na galantine. He fell forward, with his face against the chopping-block.\r\nLisa did not lose her self-possession. She remarked that the dead man\r\ncould not be left lying in the middle of the kitchen, and had the body\r\nremoved into a little back room where Gradelle had slept. Then she\r\narranged with the assistants what should be said. It must be given out\r\nthat the master had died in his bed; otherwise the whole district would\r\nbe disgusted, and the shop would lose its customers. Quenu helped to\r\ncarry the dead man away, feeling quite confused, and astonished at\r\nbeing unable to shed any tears. Presently, however, he and Lisa cried\r\ntogether. Quenu and his brother Florent were the sole heirs. The\r\ngossips of the neighbourhood credited old Gradelle with the possession\r\nof a considerable fortune. However, not a single crown could be\r\ndiscovered. Lisa seemed very restless and uneasy. Quenu noticed how\r\npensive she became, how she kept on looking around her from morning\r\ntill night, as though she had lost something. At last she decided to\r\nhave a thorough cleaning of the premises, declaring that people were\r\nbeginning to talk, that the story of the old man\u2019s death had got about,\r\nand that it was necessary they should make a great show of cleanliness.\r\nOne afternoon, after remaining in the cellar for a couple of hours,\r\nwhither she herself had gone to wash the salting-tubs, she came up\r\nagain, carrying something in her apron. Quenu was just then cutting up\r\na pig\u2019s fry. She waited till he had finished, talking awhile in an\r\neasy, indifferent fashion. But there was an unusual glitter in her\r\neyes, and she smiled her most charming smile as she told him that she\r\nwanted to speak to him. She led the way upstairs with seeming\r\ndifficulty, impeded by what she had in her apron, which was strained\r\nalmost to bursting.\r\n\r\nBy the time she reached the third floor she found herself short of\r\nbreath, and for a moment was obliged to lean against the balustrade.\r\nQuenu, much astonished, followed her into her bedroom without saying a\r\nword. It was the first time she had ever invited him to enter it. She\r\nclosed the door, and letting go the corners of her apron, which her\r\nstiffened fingers could no longer hold up, she allowed a stream of gold\r\nand silver coins to flow gently upon her bed. She had discovered Uncle\r\nGradelle\u2019s treasure at the bottom of a salting-tub. The heap of money\r\nmade a deep impression in the softy downy bed.\r\n\r\nLisa and Quenu evinced a quiet delight. They sat down on the edge of\r\nthe bed, Lisa at the head and Quenu at the foot, on either side of the\r\nheap of coins, and they counted the money out upon the counterpane, so\r\nas to avoid making any noise. There were forty thousand francs in gold,\r\nand three thousand francs in silver, whilst in a tin box they found\r\nbank notes to the value of forty-two thousand francs. It took them two\r\nhours to count up the treasure. Quenu\u2019s hands trembled slightly, and it\r\nwas Lisa who did most of the work.\r\n\r\nThey arranged the gold on the pillow in little heaps, leaving the\r\nsilver in the hollow depression of the counterpane. When they had\r\nascertained the total amount\u2014eighty-five thousand francs, to them an\r\nenormous sum\u2014they began to chat. And their conversation naturally\r\nturned upon their future, and they spoke of their marriage, although\r\nthere had never been any previous mention of love between them. But\r\nthis heap of money seemed to loosen their tongues. They had gradually\r\nseated themselves further back on the bed, leaning against the wall,\r\nbeneath the white muslin curtains; and as they talked together, their\r\nhands, playing with the heap of silver between them, met, and remained\r\nlinked amidst the pile of five-franc pieces. Twilight surprised them\r\nstill sitting together. Then, for the first time, Lisa blushed at\r\nfinding the young man by her side. For a few moments, indeed, although\r\nnot a thought of evil had come to them, they felt much embarrassed.\r\nThen Lisa went to get her own ten thousand francs. Quenu wanted her to\r\nput them with his uncle\u2019s savings. He mixed the two sums together,\r\nsaying with a laugh that the money must be married also. Then it was\r\nagreed that Lisa should keep the hoard in her chest of drawers. When\r\nshe had locked it up they both quietly went downstairs. They were now\r\npractically husband and wife.\r\n\r\nThe wedding took place during the following month. The neighbours\r\nconsidered the match a very natural one, and in every way suitable.\r\nThey had vaguely heard the story of the treasure, and Lisa\u2019s honesty\r\nwas the subject of endless eulogy. After all, said the gossips, she\r\nmight well have kept the money herself, and not have spoken a word to\r\nQuenu about it; if she had spoken, it was out of pure honesty, for no\r\none had seen her find the hoard. She well deserved, they added, that\r\nQuenu should make her his wife. That Quenu, by the way, was a lucky\r\nfellow; he wasn\u2019t a beauty himself, yet he had secured a beautiful\r\nwife, who had disinterred a fortune for him. Some even went so far as\r\nto whisper that Lisa was a simpleton for having acted as she had done;\r\nbut the young woman only smiled when people speaking to her vaguely\r\nalluded to all these things. She and her husband lived on as\r\npreviously, in happy placidity and quiet affection. She still assisted\r\nhim as before, their hands still met amidst the sausage-meat, she still\r\nglanced over his shoulder into the pots and pans, and still nothing but\r\nthe great fire in the kitchen brought the blood to their cheeks.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lisa was a woman of practical common sense, and speedily saw\r\nthe folly of allowing eighty-five thousand francs to lie idle in a\r\nchest of drawers. Quenu would have willingly stowed them away again at\r\nthe bottom of the salting-tub until he had gained as much more, when\r\nthey could have retired from business and have gone to live at\r\nSuresnes, a suburb to which both were partial. Lisa, however, had other\r\nambitions. The Rue Pirouette did not accord with her ideas of\r\ncleanliness, her craving for fresh air, light, and healthy life. The\r\nshop where Uncle Gradelle had accumulated his fortune, sou by sou, was\r\na long, dark place, one of those suspicious looking pork butchers\u2019\r\nshops of the old quarters of the city, where the well-worn flagstones\r\nretain a strong odour of meat in spite of constant washings. Now the\r\nyoung woman longed for one of those bright modern shops, ornamented\r\nlike a drawing-room, and fringing the footway of some broad street with\r\nwindows of crystalline transparence. She was not actuated by any petty\r\nambition to play the fine lady behind a stylish counter, but clearly\r\nrealised that commerce in its latest development needed elegant\r\nsurroundings. Quenu showed much alarm the first time his wife suggested\r\nthat they ought to move and spend some of their money in decorating a\r\nnew shop. However, Lisa only shrugged her shoulders and smiled at\r\nfinding him so timorous.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when night was falling and the shop had grown dark, Quenu\r\nand Lisa overheard a woman of the neighbourhood talking to a friend\r\noutside their door.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, indeed! I\u2019ve given up dealing with them,\u201D said she. \u201CI wouldn\u2019t\r\nbuy a bit of black-pudding from them now on any account. They had a\r\ndead man in their kitchen, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu wept with vexation. The story of Gradelle\u2019s death in the kitchen\r\nwas clearly getting about; and his nephew began to blush before his\r\ncustomers when he saw them sniffing his wares too closely. So, of his\r\nown accord, he spoke to his wife of her proposal to take a new shop.\r\nLisa, without saying anything, had already been looking out for other\r\npremises, and had found some, admirably situated, only a few yards\r\naway, in the Rue Rambuteau. The immediate neighbourhood of the central\r\nmarkets, which were being opened just opposite, would triple their\r\nbusiness, and make their shop known all over Paris.\r\n\r\nQuenu allowed himself to be drawn into a lavish expenditure of money;\r\nhe laid out over thirty thousand francs in marble, glass, and gilding.\r\nLisa spent hours with the workmen, giving her views about the slightest\r\ndetails. When she was at last installed behind the counter, customers\r\narrived in a perfect procession, merely for the sake of examining the\r\nshop. The inside walls were lined from top to bottom with white marble.\r\nThe ceiling was covered with a huge square mirror, framed by a broad\r\ngilded cornice, richly ornamented, whilst from the centre hung a\r\ncrystal chandelier with four branches. And behind the counter, and on\r\nthe left, and at the far end of the shop were other mirrors, fitted\r\nbetween the marble panels and looking like doors opening into an\r\ninfinite series of brightly lighted halls, where all sorts of\r\nappetising edibles were displayed. The huge counter on the right hand\r\nwas considered a very fine piece of work. At intervals along the front\r\nwere lozenge-shaped panels of pinky marble. The flooring was of tiles,\r\nalternately white and pink, with a deep red fretting as border. The\r\nwhole neighbourhood was proud of the shop, and no one again thought of\r\nreferring to the kitchen in the Rue Pirouette, where a man had died.\r\nFor quite a month women stopped short on the footway to look at Lisa\r\nbetween the saveloys and bladders in the window. Her white and pink\r\nflesh excited as much admiration as the marbles. She seemed to be the\r\nsoul, the living light, the healthy, sturdy idol of the pork trade; and\r\nthenceforth one and all baptised her \u201CLisa the beauty.\u201D\r\n\r\nTo the right of the shop was the dining-room, a neat looking apartment\r\ncontaining a sideboard, a table, and several cane-seated chairs of\r\nlight oak. The matting on the floor, the wallpaper of a soft yellow\r\ntint, the oil-cloth table-cover, coloured to imitate oak, gave the room\r\na somewhat cold appearance, which was relieved only by the glitter of a\r\nbrass hanging lamp, suspended from the ceiling, and spreading its big\r\nshade of transparent porcelain over the table. One of the dining-room\r\ndoors opened into the huge square kitchen, at the end of which was a\r\nsmall paved courtyard, serving for the storage of lumber\u2014tubs, barrels\r\nand pans, and all kinds of utensils not in use. To the left of the\r\nwater-tap, alongside the gutter which carried off the greasy water,\r\nstood pots of faded flowers, removed from the shop window, and slowly\r\ndying.\r\n\r\nBusiness was excellent. Quenu, who had been much alarmed by the initial\r\noutlay, now regarded his wife with something like respect, and told his\r\nfriends that she had \u201Ca wonderful head.\u201D At the end of five years they\r\nhad nearly eighty thousand francs invested in the State funds. Lisa\r\nwould say that they were not ambitious, that they had no desire to pile\r\nup money too quickly, or else she would have enabled her husband to\r\ngain hundreds and thousands of francs by prompting him to embark in the\r\nwholesale pig trade. But they were still young, and had plenty of time\r\nbefore them; besides, they didn\u2019t care about a rough, scrambling\r\nbusiness, but preferred to work at their ease, and enjoy life, instead\r\nof wearing themselves out with endless anxieties.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor instance,\u201D Lisa would add in her expansive moments, \u201CI have, you\r\nknow, a cousin in Paris. I never see him, as the two families have\r\nfallen out. He has taken the name of Saccard,[*] on account of certain\r\nmatters which he wants to be forgotten. Well, this cousin of mine, I\u2019m\r\ntold, makes millions and millions of francs; but he gets no enjoyment\r\nout of life. He\u2019s always in a state of feverish excitement, always\r\nrushing hither and thither, up to his neck in all sorts of worrying\r\nbusiness. Well, it\u2019s impossible, isn\u2019t it, for such a man to eat his\r\ndinner peaceably in the evening? We, at any rate, can take our meals\r\ncomfortably, and make sure of what we eat, and we are not harassed by\r\nworries as he is. The only reason why people should care for money is\r\nthat money\u2019s wanted for one to live. People like comfort; that\u2019s\r\nnatural. But as for making money simply for the sake of making it, and\r\ngiving yourself far more trouble and anxiety to gain it than you can\r\never get pleasure from it when it\u2019s gained, why, as for me, I\u2019d rather\r\nsit still and cross my arms. And besides, I should like to see all\r\nthose millions of my cousin\u2019s. I can\u2019t say that I altogether believe in\r\nthem. I caught sight of him the other day in his carriage. He was quite\r\nyellow, and looked ever so sly. A man who\u2019s making money doesn\u2019t have\r\nthat kind of expression. But it\u2019s his business, and not mine. For our\r\npart, we prefer to make merely a hundred sous at a time, and to get a\r\nhundred sous\u2019 worth of enjoyment out of them.\u201D\r\n\r\n[*] See M. Zola\u2019s novel, _Money_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe household was undoubtedly thriving. A daughter had been born to the\r\nyoung couple during their first year of wedlock, and all three of them\r\nlooked blooming. The business went on prosperously, without any\r\nlaborious fatigue, just as Lisa desired. She had carefully kept free of\r\nany possible source of trouble or anxiety, and the days went by in an\r\natmosphere of peaceful, unctuous prosperity. Their home was a nook of\r\nsensible happiness\u2014a comfortable manger, so to speak, where father,\r\nmother, and daughter could grow sleek and fat. It was only Quenu who\r\noccasionally felt sad, through thinking of his brother Florent. Up to\r\nthe year 1856 he had received letters from him at long intervals. Then\r\nno more came, and he had learned from a newspaper that three convicts\r\nhaving attempted to escape from the \u00CEle du Diable, had been drowned\r\nbefore they were able to reach the mainland. He had made inquiries at\r\nthe Prefecture of Police, but had not learnt anything definite; it\r\nseemed probable that his brother was dead. However, he did not lose all\r\nhope, though months passed without any tidings. Florent, in the\r\nmeantime, was wandering about Dutch Guiana, and refrained from writing\r\nhome as he was ever in hope of being able to return to France. Quenu at\r\nlast began to mourn for him as one mourns for those whom one has been\r\nunable to bid farewell. Lisa had never known Florent, but she spoke\r\nvery kindly whenever she saw her husband give way to his sorrow; and\r\nshe evinced no impatience when for the hundredth time or so he began to\r\nrelate stories of his early days, of his life in the big room in the\r\nRue Royer Collard, the thirty-six trades which he had taken up one\r\nafter another, and the dainties which he had cooked at the stove,\r\ndressed all in white, while Florent was dressed all in black. To such\r\ntalk as this, indeed, she listened placidly, with a complacency which\r\nnever wearied.\r\n\r\nIt was into the midst of all this happiness, ripening after careful\r\nculture, that Florent dropped one September morning just as Lisa was\r\ntaking her matutinal bath of sunshine, and Quenu, with his eyes still\r\nheavy with sleep, was lazily applying his fingers to the congealed fat\r\nleft in the pans from the previous evening. Florent\u2019s arrival caused a\r\ngreat commotion. Gavard advised them to conceal the \u201Coutlaw,\u201D as he\r\nsomewhat pompously called Florent. Lisa, who looked pale, and more\r\nserious than was her wont, at last took him to the fifth floor, where\r\nshe gave him the room belonging to the girl who assisted her in the\r\nshop. Quenu had cut some slices of bread and ham, but Florent was\r\nscarcely able to eat. He was overcome by dizziness and nausea, and went\r\nto bed, where he remained for five days in a state of delirium, the\r\noutcome of an attack of brain-fever, which fortunately received\r\nenergetic treatment. When he recovered consciousness he perceived Lisa\r\nsitting by his bedside, silently stirring some cooling drink in a cup.\r\nAs he tried to thank her, she told him that he must keep perfectly\r\nquiet, and that they could talk together later on. At the end of\r\nanother three days Florent was on his feet again. Then one morning\r\nQuenu went up to tell him that Lisa awaited them in her room on the\r\nfirst floor.\r\n\r\nQuenu and his wife there occupied a suite of three rooms and a\r\ndressing-room. You first passed through an antechamber, containing\r\nnothing but chairs, and then a small sitting-room, whose furniture,\r\nshrouded in white covers, slumbered in the gloom cast by the Venetian\r\nshutters, which were always kept closed so as to prevent the light blue\r\nof the upholstery from fading. Then came the bedroom, the only one of\r\nthe three which was really used. It was very comfortably furnished in\r\nmahogany. The bed, bulky and drowsy of aspect in the depths of the damp\r\nalcove, was really wonderful, with its four mattresses, its four\r\npillows, its layers of blankets, and its corpulent _\u00E9dredon_. It was\r\nevidently a bed intended for slumber. A mirrored wardrobe, a washstand\r\nwith drawers, a small central table with a worked cover, and several\r\nchairs whose seats were protected by squares of lace, gave the room an\r\naspect of plain but substantial middle-class luxury. On the left-hand\r\nwall, on either side of the mantelpiece, which was ornamented with some\r\nlandscape-painted vases mounted on bronze stands, and a gilt timepiece\r\non which a figure of Gutenberg, also gilt, stood in an attitude of deep\r\nthought, hung portraits in oils of Quenu and Lisa, in ornate oval\r\nframes. Quenu had a smiling face, while Lisa wore an air of grave\r\npropriety; and both were dressed in black and depicted in flattering\r\nfashion, their features idealised, their skins wondrously smooth, their\r\ncomplexions soft and pinky. A carpet, in the Wilton style, with a\r\ncomplicated pattern of roses mingling with stars, concealed the\r\nflooring; while in front of the bed was a fluffy mat, made out of long\r\npieces of curly wool, a work of patience at which Lisa herself had\r\ntoiled while seated behind her counter. But the most striking object of\r\nall in the midst of this array of new furniture was a great square,\r\nthick-set secr\u00E9taire, which had been re-polished in vain, for the\r\ncracks and notches in the marble top and the scratches on the old\r\nmahogany front, quite black with age, still showed plainly. Lisa had\r\ndesired to retain this piece of furniture, however, as Uncle Gradelle\r\nhad used it for more than forty years. It would bring them good luck,\r\nshe said. It\u2019s metal fastenings were truly something terrible, it\u2019s\r\nlock was like that of a prison gate, and it was so heavy that it could\r\nscarcely be moved.\r\n\r\nWhen Florent and Quenu entered the room they found Lisa seated at the\r\nlowered desk of the secr\u00E9taire, writing and putting down figures in a\r\nbig, round, and very legible hand. She signed to them not to disturb\r\nher, and the two men sat down. Florent looked round the room, and\r\nnotably at the two portraits, the bed and the timepiece, with an air of\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere!\u201D at last exclaimed Lisa, after having carefully verified a\r\nwhole page of calculations. \u201CListen to me now; we have an account to\r\nrender to you, my dear Florent.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that she had so addressed him. However, taking up\r\nthe page of figures, she continued: \u201CYour Uncle Gradelle died without\r\nleaving a will. Consequently you and your brother are his sole heirs.\r\nWe now have to hand your share over to you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I do not ask you for anything!\u201D exclaimed Florent, \u201CI don\u2019t wish\r\nfor anything!\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu had apparently been in ignorance of his wife\u2019s intentions. He\r\nturned rather pale and looked at her with an expression of displeasure.\r\nOf course, he certainly loved his brother dearly; but there was no\r\noccasion to hurl his uncle\u2019s money at him in this way. There would have\r\nbeen plenty of time to go into the matter later on.\r\n\r\n\u201CI know very well, my dear Florent,\u201D continued Lisa, \u201Cthat you did not\r\ncome back with the intention of claiming from us what belongs to you;\r\nbut business is business, you know, and we had better get things\r\nsettled at once. Your uncle\u2019s savings amounted to eighty-five thousand\r\nfrancs. I have therefore put down forty-two thousand five hundred to\r\nyour credit. See!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe showed him the figures on the sheet of paper.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is unfortunately not so easy to value the shop, plant,\r\nstock-in-trade, and goodwill. I have only been able to put down\r\napproximate amounts, but I don\u2019t think I have underestimated anything.\r\nWell, the total valuation which I have made comes to fifteen thousand\r\nthree hundred and ten francs; your half of which is seven thousand six\r\nhundred and fifty-five francs, so that your share amounts, in all, to\r\nfifty thousand one hundred and fifty-five francs. Please verify it for\r\nyourself, will you?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe had called out the figures in a clear, distinct voice, and she now\r\nhanded the paper to Florent, who was obliged to take it.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut the old man\u2019s business was certainly never worth fifteen thousand\r\nfrancs!\u201D cried Quenu. \u201CWhy, I wouldn\u2019t have given ten thousand for it!\u201D\r\n\r\nHe had ended by getting quite angry with his wife. Really, it was\r\nabsurd to carry honesty to such a point as that! Had Florent said one\r\nword about the business? No, indeed, he had declared that he didn\u2019t\r\nwish for anything.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe business was worth fifteen thousand three hundred and ten francs,\u201D\r\nLisa re-asserted, calmly. \u201CYou will agree with me, my dear Florent,\r\nthat it is quite unnecessary to bring a lawyer into our affairs. It is\r\nfor us to arrange the division between ourselves, since you have now\r\nturned up again. I naturally thought of this as soon as you arrived;\r\nand, while you were in bed with the fever, I did my best to draw up\r\nthis little inventory. It contains, as you see, a fairly complete\r\nstatement of everything. I have been through our old books, and have\r\ncalled up my memory to help me. Read it aloud, and I will give you any\r\nadditional information you may want.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent ended by smiling. He was touched by this easy and, as it were,\r\nnatural display of probity. Placing the sheet of figures on the young\r\nwoman\u2019s knee, he took hold of her hand and said, \u201CI am very glad, my\r\ndear Lisa, to hear that you are prosperous, but I will not take your\r\nmoney. The heritage belongs to you and my brother, who took care of my\r\nuncle up to the last. I don\u2019t require anything, and I don\u2019t intend to\r\nhamper you in carrying on your business.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa insisted, and even showed some vexation, while Quenu gnawed his\r\nthumbs in silence to restrain himself.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D resumed Florent with a laugh, \u201Cif Uncle Gradelle could hear you,\r\nI think he\u2019d come back and take the money away again. I was never a\r\nfavourite of his, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, no,\u201D muttered Quenu, no longer able to keep still, \u201Che certainly\r\nwasn\u2019t over fond of you.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa, however, still pressed the matter. She did not like to have money\r\nin her secr\u00E9taire that did not belong to her; it would worry her, said\r\nshe; the thought of it would disturb her peace. Thereupon Florent,\r\nstill in a joking way, proposed to invest his share in the business.\r\nMoreover, said he, he did not intend to refuse their help; he would, no\r\ndoubt, be unable to find employment all at once; and then, too, he\r\nwould need a complete outfit, for he was scarcely presentable.\r\n\r\n\u201COf course,\u201D cried Quenu, \u201Cyou will board and lodge with us, and we\r\nwill buy you all that you want. That\u2019s understood. You know very well\r\nthat we are not likely to leave you in the streets, I hope!\u201D\r\n\r\nHe was quite moved now, and even felt a trifle ashamed of the alarm he\r\nhad experienced at the thought of having to hand over a large amount of\r\nmoney all at once. He began to joke, and told his brother that he would\r\nundertake to fatten him. Florent gently shook his hand; while Lisa\r\nfolded up the sheet of figures and put it away in a drawer of the\r\nsecr\u00E9taire.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are wrong,\u201D she said by way of conclusion. \u201CI have done what I was\r\nbound to do. Now it shall be as you wish. But, for my part, I should\r\nnever have had a moment\u2019s peace if I had not put things before you. Bad\r\nthoughts would quite upset me.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey then began to speak of another matter. It would be necessary to\r\ngive some reason for Florent\u2019s presence, and at the same time avoid\r\nexciting the suspicion of the police. He told them that in order to\r\nreturn to France he had availed himself of the papers of a poor fellow\r\nwho had died in his arms at Surinam from yellow fever. By a singular\r\ncoincidence this young fellow\u2019s Christian name was Florent.\r\n\r\nFlorent Laquerriere, to give him his name in full, had left but one\r\nrelation in Paris, a female cousin, and had been informed of her death\r\nwhile in America. Nothing could therefore be easier than for Quenu\u2019s\r\nhalf brother to pass himself off as the man who had died at Surinam.\r\nLisa offered to take upon herself the part of the female cousin. They\r\nthen agreed to relate that their cousin Florent had returned from\r\nabroad, where he had failed in his attempts to make a fortune, and that\r\nthey, the Quenu-Gradelles, as they were called in the neighbourhood,\r\nhad received him into their house until he could find suitable\r\nemployment. When this was all settled, Quenu insisted upon his brother\r\nmaking a thorough inspection of the rooms, and would not spare him the\r\nexamination of a single stool. Whilst they were in the bare looking\r\nchamber containing nothing but chairs, Lisa pushed open a door, and\r\nshowing Florent a small dressing room, told him that the shop girl\r\nshould sleep in it, so that he could retain the bedroom on the fifth\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Florent was arrayed in new clothes from head to foot. He\r\nhad insisted upon again having a black coat and black trousers, much\r\nagainst the advice of Quenu, upon whom black had a depressing effect.\r\nNo further attempts were made to conceal his presence in the house, and\r\nLisa told the story which had been planned to everyone who cared to\r\nhear it. Henceforth Florent spent almost all his time on the premises,\r\nlingering on a chair in the kitchen or leaning against the marble-work\r\nin the shop. At meal times Quenu plied him with food, and evinced\r\nconsiderable vexation when he proved such a small eater and left half\r\nthe contents of his liberally filled plate untouched. Lisa had resumed\r\nher old life, evincing a kindly tolerance of her brother-in-law\u2019s\r\npresence, even in the morning, when he somewhat interfered with the\r\nwork. Then she would momentarily forget him, and on suddenly perceiving\r\nhis black form in front of her give a slight start of surprise,\r\nfollowed, however, by one of her sweet smiles, lest he might feel at\r\nall hurt. This skinny man\u2019s disinterestedness had impressed her, and\r\nshe regarded him with a feeling akin to respect, mingled with vague\r\nfear. Florent had for his part only felt that there was great affection\r\naround him.\r\n\r\nWhen bedtime came he went upstairs, a little wearied by his lazy day,\r\nwith the two young men whom Quenu employed as assistants, and who slept\r\nin attics adjoining his own. Leon, the apprentice, was barely fifteen\r\nyears of age. He was a slight, gentle looking lad, addicted to stealing\r\nstray slices of ham and bits of sausages. These he would conceal under\r\nhis pillow, eating them during the night without any bread. Several\r\ntimes at about one o\u2019clock in the morning Florent almost fancied that\r\nLeon was giving a supper-party; for he heard low whispering followed by\r\na sound of munching jaws and rustling paper. And then a rippling\r\ngirlish laugh would break faintly on the deep silence of the sleeping\r\nhouse like the soft trilling of a flageolet.\r\n\r\nThe other assistant, Auguste Landois, came from Troyes. Bloated with\r\nunhealthy fat, he had too large a head, and was already bald, although\r\nonly twenty-eight years of age. As he went upstairs with Florent on the\r\nfirst evening, he told him his story in a confused, garrulous way. He\r\nhad at first come to Paris merely for the purpose of perfecting himself\r\nin the business, intending to return to Troyes, where his cousin,\r\nAugustine Landois, was waiting for him, and there setting up for\r\nhimself as a pork butcher. He and she had had the same godfather and\r\nbore virtually the same Christian name. However, he had grown\r\nambitious; and now hoped to establish himself in business in Paris by\r\nthe aid of the money left him by his mother, which he had deposited\r\nwith a notary before leaving Champagne.\r\n\r\nAuguste had got so far in his narrative when the fifth floor was\r\nreached; however, he still detained Florent, in order to sound the\r\npraises of Madame Quenu, who had consented to send for Augustine\r\nLandois to replace an assistant who had turned out badly. He himself\r\nwas now thoroughly acquainted with his part of the business, and his\r\ncousin was perfecting herself in shop management. In a year or eighteen\r\nmonths they would be married, and then they would set up on their own\r\naccount in some populous corner of Paris, at Plaisance most likely.\r\nThey were in no great hurry, he added, for the bacon trade was very bad\r\nthat year. Then he proceeded to tell Florent that he and his cousin had\r\nbeen photographed together at the fair of St. Ouen, and he entered the\r\nattic to have another look at the photograph, which Augustine had left\r\non the mantelpiece, in her desire that Madame Quenu\u2019s cousin should\r\nhave a pretty room. Auguste lingered there for a moment, looking quite\r\nlivid in the dim yellow light of his candle, and casting his eyes\r\naround the little chamber which was still full of memorials of the\r\nyoung girl. Next, stepping up to the bed, he asked Florent if it was\r\ncomfortable. His cousin slept below now, said he, and would be better\r\nthere in the winter, for the attics were very cold. Then at last he\r\nwent off, leaving Florent alone with the bed, and standing in front of\r\nthe photograph. As shown on the latter Auguste looked like a sort of\r\npale Quenu, and Augustine like an immature Lisa.\r\n\r\nFlorent, although on friendly terms with the assistants, petted by his\r\nbrother, and cordially treated by Lisa, presently began to feel very\r\nbored. He had tried, but without success, to obtain some pupils;\r\nmoreover, he purposely avoided the students\u2019 quarter for fear of being\r\nrecognised. Lisa gently suggested to him that he had better try to\r\nobtain a situation in some commercial house, where he could take charge\r\nof the correspondence and keep the books. She returned to this subject\r\nagain and again, and at last offered to find a berth for him herself.\r\nShe was gradually becoming impatient at finding him so often in her\r\nway, idle, and not knowing what to do with himself. At first this\r\nimpatience was merely due to the dislike she felt of people who do\r\nnothing but cross their arms and eat, and she had no thought of\r\nreproaching him for consuming her substance.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor my own part,\u201D she would say to him, \u201CI could never spend the whole\r\nday in dreamy lounging. You can\u2019t have any appetite for your meals. You\r\nought to tire yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\nGavard, also, was seeking a situation for Florent, but in a very\r\nextraordinary and most mysterious fashion. He would have liked to find\r\nsome employment of a dramatic character, or in which there should be a\r\ntouch of bitter irony, as was suitable for an outlaw. Gavard was a man\r\nwho was always in opposition. He had just completed his fiftieth year,\r\nand he boasted that he had already passed judgment on four Governments.\r\nHe still contemptuously shrugged his shoulders at the thought of\r\nCharles X, the priests and nobles and other attendant rabble, whom he\r\nhad helped to sweep away. Louis Philippe, with his bourgeois following,\r\nhad been an imbecile, and he could tell how the citizen-king had\r\nhoarded his coppers in a woollen stocking. As for the Republic of \u201848,\r\nthat had been a mere farce, the working classes had deceived him;\r\nhowever, he no longer acknowledged that he had applauded the Coup\r\nd\u2019Etat, for he now looked upon Napoleon III as his personal enemy, a\r\nscoundrel who shut himself up with Morny and others to indulge in\r\ngluttonous orgies. He was never weary of holding forth upon this\r\nsubject. Lowering his voice a little, he would declare that women were\r\nbrought to the Tuileries in closed carriages every evening, and that\r\nhe, who was speaking, had one night heard the echoes of the orgies\r\nwhile crossing the Place du Carrousel. It was Gavard\u2019s religion to make\r\nhimself as disagreeable as possible to any existing Government. He\r\nwould seek to spite it in all sorts of ways, and laugh in secret for\r\nseveral months at the pranks he played. To begin with, he voted for\r\ncandidates who would worry the Ministers at the Corps L\u00E9gislatif. Then,\r\nif he could rob the revenue, or baffle the police, and bring about a\r\nrow of some kind or other, he strove to give the affair as much of an\r\ninsurrectionary character as possible. He told a great many lies, too;\r\nset himself up as being a very dangerous man; talked as though \u201Cthe\r\nsatellites of the Tuileries\u201D were well acquainted with him and trembled\r\nat the sight of him; and asserted that one half of them must be\r\nguillotined, and the other half transported, the next time there was \u201Ca\r\nflare-up.\u201D His violent political creed found food in boastful, bragging\r\ntalk of this sort; he displayed all the partiality for a lark and a\r\nrumpus which prompts a Parisian shopkeeper to take down his shutters on\r\na day of barricade-fighting to get a good view of the corpses of the\r\nslain. When Florent returned from Cayenne, Gavard opined that he had\r\ngot hold of a splendid chance for some abominable trick, and bestowed\r\nmuch thought upon the question of how he might best vent his spleen on\r\nthe Emperor and Ministers and everyone in office, down to the very\r\nlowest police constable.\r\n\r\nGavard\u2019s manners with Florent were altogether those of a man tasting\r\nsome forbidden pleasure. He contemplated him with blinking eyes,\r\nlowered his voice even when making the most trifling remark, and\r\ngrasped his hand with all sorts of masonic flummery. He had at last\r\nlighted upon something in the way of an adventure; he had a friend who\r\nwas really compromised, and could, without falsehood speak of the\r\ndangers he incurred. He undoubtedly experienced a secret alarm at the\r\nsight of this man who had returned from transportation, and whose\r\nfleshlessness testified to the long sufferings he had endured; however,\r\nthis touch of alarm was delightful, for it increased his notion of his\r\nown importance, and convinced him that he was really doing something\r\nwonderful in treating a dangerous character as a friend. Florent became\r\na sort of sacred being in his eyes: he swore by him alone, and had\r\nrecourse to his name whenever arguments failed him and he wanted to\r\ncrush the Government once and for all.\r\n\r\nGavard had lost his wife in the Rue Saint Jacques some months after the\r\nCoup d\u2019Etat; however, he had kept on his roasting shop till 1856. At\r\nthat time it was reported that he had made large sums of money by going\r\ninto partnership with a neighbouring grocer who had obtained a contract\r\nfor supplying dried vegetables to the Crimean expeditionary corps. The\r\ntruth was, however, that, having sold his shop, he lived on his income\r\nfor a year without doing anything. He himself did not care to talk\r\nabout the real origin of his fortune, for to have revealed it would\r\nhave prevented him from plainly expressing his opinion of the Crimean\r\nWar, which he referred to as a mere adventurous expedition, \u201Cundertaken\r\nsimply to consolidate the throne and to fill certain persons\u2019 pockets.\u201D\r\nAt the end of a year he had grown utterly weary of life in his bachelor\r\nquarters. As he was in the habit of visiting the Quenu-Gradelles almost\r\ndaily, he determined to take up his residence nearer to them, and came\r\nto live in the Rue de la Cossonnerie. The neighbouring markets, with\r\ntheir noisy uproar and endless chatter, quite fascinated him; and he\r\ndecided to hire a stall in the poultry pavilion, just for the purpose\r\nof amusing himself and occupying his idle hours with all the gossip.\r\nThenceforth he lived amidst ceaseless tittle-tattle, acquainted with\r\nevery little scandal in the neighbourhood, his head buzzing with the\r\nincessant yelping around him. He blissfully tasted a thousand\r\ntitillating delights, having at last found his true element, and\r\nbathing in it, with the voluptuous pleasure of a carp swimming in the\r\nsunshine. Florent would sometimes go to see him at his stall. The\r\nafternoons were still very warm. All along the narrow alleys sat women\r\nplucking poultry. Rays of light streamed in between the awnings, and in\r\nthe warm atmosphere, in the golden dust of the sunbeams, feathers\r\nfluttered hither and thither like dancing snowflakes. A trail of\r\ncoaxing calls and offers followed Florent as he passed along. \u201CCan I\r\nsell you a fine duck, monsieur?\u201D \u201CI\u2019ve some very fine fat chickens\r\nhere, monsieur; come and see!\u201D \u201CMonsieur! monsieur, do just buy this\r\npair of pigeons!\u201D Deafened and embarrassed he freed himself from the\r\nwomen, who still went on plucking as they fought for possession of him;\r\nand the fine down flew about and wellnigh choked him, like hot smoke\r\nreeking with the strong odour of the poultry. At last, in the middle of\r\nthe alley, near the water-taps, he found Gavard ranting away in his\r\nshirt-sleeves, in front of his stall, with his arms crossed over the\r\nbib of his blue apron. He reigned there, in a gracious, condescending\r\nway, over a group of ten or twelve women. He was the only male dealer\r\nin that part of the market. He was so fond of wagging his tongue that\r\nhe had quarrelled with five or six girls whom he had successively\r\nengaged to attend to his stall, and had now made up his mind to sell\r\nhis goods himself, naively explaining that the silly women spent the\r\nwhole blessed day in gossiping, and that it was beyond his power to\r\nmanage them. As someone, however, was still necessary to supply his\r\nplace whenever he absented himself he took in Marjolin, who was\r\nprowling about, after attempting in turn all the petty market callings.\r\n\r\nFlorent sometimes remained for an hour with Gavard, amazed by his\r\nceaseless flow of chatter, and his calm serenity and assurance amid the\r\ncrowd of petticoats. He would interrupt one woman, pick a quarrel with\r\nanother ten stalls away, snatch a customer from a third, and make as\r\nmuch noise himself as his hundred and odd garrulous neighbours, whose\r\nincessant clamour kept the iron plates of the pavilion vibrating\r\nsonorously like so many gongs.\r\n\r\nThe poultry dealer\u2019s only relations were a sister-in-law and a niece.\r\nWhen his wife died, her eldest sister, Madame Lec\u0153ur, who had become a\r\nwidow about a year previously, had mourned for her in an exaggerated\r\nfashion, and gone almost every evening to tender consolation to the\r\nbereaved husband. She had doubtless cherished the hope that she might\r\nwin his affection and fill the yet warm place of the deceased. Gavard,\r\nhowever, abominated lean women; and would, indeed, only stroke such\r\ncats and dogs as were very fat; so that Madame Lec\u0153ur, who was long and\r\nwithered, failed in her designs.\r\n\r\nWith her feelings greatly hurt, furious at the ex-roaster\u2019s five-franc\r\npieces eluding her grasp, she nurtured great spite against him. He\r\nbecame the enemy to whom she devoted all her time. When she saw him set\r\nup in the markets only a few yards away from the pavilion where she\r\nherself sold butter and eggs and cheese, she accused him of doing so\r\nsimply for the sake of annoying her and bringing her bad luck. From\r\nthat moment she began to lament, and turned so yellow and melancholy\r\nthat she indeed ended by losing her customers and getting into\r\ndifficulties. She had for a long time kept with her the daughter of one\r\nof her sisters, a peasant woman who had sent her the child and then\r\ntaken no further trouble about it.\r\n\r\nThis child grew up in the markets. Her surname was Sarriet, and so she\r\nsoon became generally known as La Sarriette. At sixteen years of age\r\nshe had developed into such a charming sly-looking puss that gentlemen\r\ncame to buy cheeses at her aunt\u2019s stall simply for the purpose of\r\nogling her. She did not care for the gentlemen, however; with her dark\r\nhair, pale face, and eyes glistening like live embers, her sympathies\r\nwere with the lower ranks of the people. At last she chose as her lover\r\na young man from Menilmontant who was employed by her aunt as a porter.\r\nAt twenty she set up in business as a fruit dealer with the help of\r\nsome funds procured no one knew how; and thenceforth Monsieur Jules, as\r\nher lover was called, displayed spotless hands, a clean blouse, and a\r\nvelvet cap; and only came down to the market in the afternoon, in his\r\nslippers. They lived together on the third storey of a large house in\r\nthe Rue Vauvilliers, on the ground floor of which was a disreputable\r\ncaf\u00E9.\r\n\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur\u2019s acerbity of temper was brought to a pitch by what she\r\ncalled La Sarriette\u2019s ingratitude, and she spoke of the girl in the\r\nmost violent and abusive language. They broke off all intercourse, the\r\naunt fairly exasperated, and the niece and Monsieur Jules concocting\r\nstories about the aunt, which the young man would repeat to the other\r\ndealers in the butter pavilion. Gavard found La Sarriette very\r\nentertaining, and treated her with great indulgence. Whenever they met\r\nhe would good-naturedly pat her cheeks.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, whilst Florent was sitting in his brother\u2019s shop, tired\r\nout with the fruitless pilgrimages he had made during the morning in\r\nsearch of work, Marjolin made his appearance there. This big lad, who\r\nhad the massiveness and gentleness of a Fleming, was a protege of\r\nLisa\u2019s. She would say that there was no evil in him; that he was indeed\r\na little bit stupid, but as strong as a horse, and particularly\r\ninteresting from the fact that nobody knew anything of his parentage.\r\nIt was she who had got Gavard to employ him.\r\n\r\nLisa was sitting behind the counter, feeling annoyed by the sight of\r\nFlorent\u2019s muddy boots which were soiling the pink and white tiles of\r\nthe flooring. Twice already had she risen to scatter sawdust about the\r\nshop. However, she smiled at Marjolin as he entered.\r\n\r\n\u201CMonsieur Gavard,\u201D began the young man, \u201Chas sent me to ask\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nBut all at once he stopped and glanced round; then in a lower voice he\r\nresumed: \u201CHe told me to wait till there was no one with you, and then\r\nto repeat these words, which he made me learn by heart: \u2018Ask them if\r\nthere is no danger, and if I can come and talk to them of the matter\r\nthey know about.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTell Monsieur Gavard that we are expecting him,\u201D replied Lisa, who was\r\nquite accustomed to the poultry dealer\u2019s mysterious ways.\r\n\r\nMarjolin, however, did not go away; but remained in ecstasy before the\r\nhandsome mistress of the shop, contemplating her with an expression of\r\nfawning humility.\r\n\r\nTouched, as it were, by this mute adoration, Lisa spoke to him again.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you comfortable with Monsieur Gavard?\u201D she asked. \u201CHe\u2019s not an\r\nunkind man, and you ought to try to please him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, Madame Lisa.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you don\u2019t behave as you should, you know. Only yesterday I saw you\r\nclambering about the roofs of the market again; and, besides, you are\r\nconstantly with a lot of disreputable lads and lasses. You ought to\r\nremember that you are a man now, and begin to think of the future.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, Madame Lisa.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, Lisa had to get up to wait upon a lady who came in and wanted\r\na pound of pork chops. She left the counter and went to the block at\r\nthe far end of the shop. Here, with a long, slender knife, she cut\r\nthree chops in a loin of pork; and then, raising a small cleaver with\r\nher strong hand, dealt three sharp blows which separated the chops from\r\nthe loin. At each blow she dealt, her black merino dress rose slightly\r\nbehind her, and the ribs of her stays showed beneath her tightly\r\nstretched bodice. She slowly took up the chops and weighed them with an\r\nair of gravity, her eyes gleaming and her lips tightly closed.\r\n\r\nWhen the lady had gone, and Lisa perceived Marjolin still full of\r\ndelight at having seen her deal those three clean, forcible blows with\r\nthe cleaver, she at once called out to him, \u201CWhat! haven\u2019t you gone\r\nyet?\u201D\r\n\r\nHe thereupon turned to go, but she detained him for a moment longer.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, don\u2019t let me see you again with that hussy Cadine,\u201D she said.\r\n\u201COh, it\u2019s no use to deny it! I saw you together this morning in the\r\ntripe market, watching men breaking the sheep\u2019s heads. I can\u2019t\r\nunderstand what attraction a good-looking young fellow like you can\r\nfind in such a slipshod slattern as Cadine. Now then, go and tell\r\nMonsieur Gavard that he had better come at once, while there\u2019s no one\r\nabout.\u201D\r\n\r\nMarjolin thereupon went off in confusion, without saying a word.\r\n\r\nHandsome Lisa remained standing behind her counter, with her head\r\nturned slightly in the direction of her markets, and Florent gazed at\r\nher in silence, surprised to see her looking so beautiful. He had never\r\nlooked at her properly before; indeed, he did not know the right way to\r\nlook at a woman. He now saw her rising above the viands on the counter.\r\nIn front of her was an array of white china dishes, containing long\r\nArles and Lyons sausages, slices of which had already been cut off,\r\nwith tongues and pieces of boiled pork; then a pig\u2019s head in a mass of\r\njelly; an open pot of preserved sausage-meat, and a large box of\r\nsardines disclosing a pool of oil. On the right and left, upon wooden\r\nplatters, were mounds of French and Italian brawn, a common French ham,\r\nof a pinky hue, and a Yorkshire ham, whose deep red lean showed beneath\r\na broad band of fat. There were other dishes too, round ones and oval\r\nones, containing spiced tongue, truffled galantine, and a boar\u2019s head\r\nstuffed with pistachio nuts; while close to her, in reach of her hand,\r\nstood some yellow earthen pans containing larded veal, _pat\u00E9 de foie\r\ngras_, and hare-pie.\r\n\r\nAs there were no signs of Gavard\u2019s coming, she arranged some fore-end\r\nbacon upon a little marble shelf at the end of the counter, put the\r\njars of lard and dripping back into their places, wiped the plates of\r\neach pair of scales, and saw to the fire of the heater, which was\r\ngetting low. Then she turned her head again, and gazed in silence\r\ntowards the markets. The smell of all the viands ascended around her,\r\nshe was enveloped, as it were, by the aroma of truffles. She looked\r\nbeautifully fresh that afternoon. The whiteness of all the dishes was\r\nsupplemented by that of her sleevelets and apron, above which appeared\r\nher plump neck and rosy cheeks, which recalled the soft tones of the\r\nhams and the pallor of all the transparent fat.\r\n\r\nAs Florent continued to gaze at her he began to feel intimidated,\r\ndisquieted by her prim, sedate demeanour; and in lieu of openly looking\r\nat her he ended by glancing surreptitiously in the mirrors around the\r\nshop, in which her back and face and profile could be seen. The mirror\r\non the ceiling, too, reflected the top of her head, with its tightly\r\nrolled chignon and the little bands lowered over her temples. There\r\nseemed, indeed, to be a perfect crowd of Lisas, with broad shoulders,\r\npowerful arms, and round, full bosoms. At last Florent checked his\r\nroving eyes, and let them rest on a particularly pleasing side view of\r\nthe young woman as mirrored between two pieces of pork. From the hooks\r\nrunning along the whole line of mirrors and marbles hung sides of pork\r\nand bands of larding fat; and Lisa, with her massive neck, rounded\r\nhips, and swelling bosom seen in profile, looked like some waxwork\r\nqueen in the midst of the dangling fat and meat. However, she bent\r\nforward and smiled in a friendly way at the two gold-fish which were\r\never and ever swimming round the aquarium in the window.\r\n\r\nGavard entered the shop. With an air of great importance he went to\r\nfetch Quenu from the kitchen. Then he seated himself upon a small\r\nmarble-topped table, while Florent remained on his chair and Lisa\r\nbehind the counter; Quenu meantime leaning his back against a side of\r\npork. And thereupon Gavard announced that he had at last found a\r\nsituation for Florent. They would be vastly amused when they heard what\r\nit was, and the Government would be nicely caught.\r\n\r\nBut all at once he stopped short, for a passing neighbour, Mademoiselle\r\nSaget, having seen such a large party gossiping together at the\r\nQuenu-Gradelles\u2019, had opened the door and entered the shop. Carrying\r\nher everlasting black ribbonless straw hat, which appropriately cast a\r\nshadow over her prying white face, she saluted the men with a slight\r\nbow and Lisa with a sharp smile.\r\n\r\nShe was an acquaintance of the family, and still lived in the house in\r\nthe Rue Pirouette where she had resided for the last forty years,\r\nprobably on a small private income; but of that she never spoke. She\r\nhad, however, one day talked of Cherbourg, mentioning that she had been\r\nborn there. Nothing further was ever known of her antecedents. All her\r\nconversation was about other people; she could tell the whole story of\r\ntheir daily lives, even to the number of things they sent to be washed\r\neach month; and she carried her prying curiosity concerning her\r\nneighbours\u2019 affairs so far as to listen behind their doors and open\r\ntheir letters. Her tongue was feared from the Rue Saint Denis to the\r\nRue Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and from the Rue Saint Honor\u00E9 to the Rue\r\nMauconseil. All day long she went ferreting about with her empty bag,\r\npretending that she was marketing, but in reality buying nothing, as\r\nher sole purpose was to retail scandal and gossip, and keep herself\r\nfully informed of every trifling incident that happened. Indeed, she\r\nhad turned her brain into an encyclopaedia brimful of every possible\r\nparticular concerning the people of the neighbourhood and their homes.\r\n\r\nQuenu had always accused her of having spread the story of his Uncle\r\nGradelle\u2019s death on the chopping-block, and had borne her a grudge ever\r\nsince. She was extremely well posted in the history of Uncle Gradelle\r\nand the Quenus, and knew them, she would say, by heart. For the last\r\nfortnight, however, Florent\u2019s arrival had greatly perplexed her, filled\r\nher, indeed, with a perfect fever of curiosity. She became quite ill\r\nwhen she discovered any unforeseen gap in her information. And yet she\r\ncould have sworn that she had seen that tall lanky fellow somewhere or\r\nother before.\r\n\r\nShe remained standing in front of the counter, examining the dishes one\r\nafter another, and saying in a shrill voice:\r\n\r\n\u201CI hardly know what to have. When the afternoon comes I feel quite\r\nfamished for my dinner, and then, later on, I don\u2019t seem able to fancy\r\nanything at all. Have you got a cutlet rolled in bread-crumbs left,\r\nMadame Quenu?\u201D\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for a reply, she removed one of the covers of the\r\nheater. It was that of the compartment reserved for the chitterlings,\r\nsausages, and black-puddings. However, the chafing-dish was quite cold,\r\nand there was nothing left but one stray forgotten sausage.\r\n\r\n\u201CLook under the other cover, Mademoiselle Saget,\u201D said Lisa. \u201CI believe\r\nthere\u2019s a cutlet there.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, it doesn\u2019t tempt me,\u201D muttered the little old woman, poking her\r\nnose under the other cover, however, all the same. \u201CI felt rather a\r\nfancy for one, but I\u2019m afraid a cutlet would be rather too heavy in the\r\nevening. I\u2019d rather have something, too, that I need not warm.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhile speaking she had turned towards Florent and looked at him; then\r\nshe looked at Gavard, who was beating a tattoo with his finger-tips on\r\nthe marble table. She smiled at them, as though inviting them to\r\ncontinue their conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201CWouldn\u2019t a little piece of salt pork suit you?\u201D asked Lisa.\r\n\r\n\u201CA piece of salt pork? Yes, that might do.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon she took up the fork with plated handle, which was lying at\r\nthe edge of the dish, and began to turn all the pieces of pork about,\r\nprodding them, lightly tapping the bones to judge of their thickness,\r\nand minutely scrutinising the shreds of pinky meat. And as she turned\r\nthem over she repeated, \u201CNo, no; it doesn\u2019t tempt me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, then, have a sheep\u2019s tongue, or a bit of brawn, or a slice of\r\nlarded veal,\u201D suggested Lisa patiently.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget, however, shook her head. She remained there for a\r\nfew minutes longer, pulling dissatisfied faces over the different\r\ndishes; then, seeing that the others were determined to remain silent,\r\nand that she would not be able to learn anything, she took herself off.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; I rather felt a fancy for a cutlet rolled in bread-crumbs,\u201D she\r\nsaid as she left the shop, \u201Cbut the one you have left is too fat. I\r\nmust come another time.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa bent forward to watch her through the sausage-skins hanging in the\r\nshop-front, and saw her cross the road and enter the fruit market.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe old she-goat!\u201D growled Gavard.\r\n\r\nThen, as they were now alone again, he began to tell them of the\r\nsituation he had found for Florent. A friend of his, he said, Monsieur\r\nVerlaque, one of the fish market inspectors, was so ill that he was\r\nobliged to take a rest; and that very morning the poor man had told him\r\nthat he should be very glad to find a substitute who would keep his\r\nberth open for him in case he should recover.\r\n\r\n\u201CVerlaque, you know, won\u2019t last another six months,\u201D added Gavard, \u201Cand\r\nFlorent will keep the place. It\u2019s a splendid idea, isn\u2019t it? And it\r\nwill be such a take-in for the police! The berth is under the\r\nPrefecture, you know. What glorious fun to see Florent getting paid by\r\nthe police, eh?\u201D\r\n\r\nHe burst into a hearty laugh; the idea struck him as so extremely\r\ncomical.\r\n\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t take the place,\u201D Florent bluntly replied. \u201CI\u2019ve sworn I\u2019ll\r\nnever accept anything from the Empire, and I would rather die of\r\nstarvation than serve under the Prefecture. It is quite out of the\r\nquestion, Gavard, quite so!\u201D\r\n\r\nGavard seemed somewhat put out on hearing this. Quenu had lowered his\r\nhead, while Lisa, turning round, looked keenly at Florent, her neck\r\nswollen, her bosom straining her bodice almost to bursting point. She\r\nwas just going to open her mouth when La Sarriette entered the shop,\r\nand there was another pause in the conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201CDear me!\u201D exclaimed La Sarriette with her soft laugh, \u201CI\u2019d almost\r\nforgotten to get any bacon fat. Please, Madame Quenu, cut me a dozen\r\nthin strips\u2014very thin ones, you know; I want them for larding larks.\r\nJules has taken it into his head to eat some larks. Ah! how do you do,\r\nuncle?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe filled the whole shop with her dancing skirts and smiled brightly\r\nat everyone. Her face looked fresh and creamy, and on one side her hair\r\nwas coming down, loosened by the wind which blew through the markets.\r\nGavard grasped her hands, while she with merry impudence resumed: \u201CI\u2019ll\r\nbet that you were talking about me just as I came in. Tell me what you\r\nwere saying, uncle.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, Lisa now called to her, \u201CJust look and tell me if this is thin\r\nenough.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was cutting the strips of bacon fat with great care on a piece of\r\nboard in front of her. Then as she wrapped them up she inquired, \u201CCan I\r\ngive you anything else?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, yes,\u201D replied La Sarriette; \u201Csince I\u2019m about it, I think I\u2019ll\r\nhave a pound of lard. I\u2019m awfully fond of fried potatoes; I can make a\r\nbreakfast off a penn\u2019orth of potatoes and a bunch of radishes. Yes,\r\nI\u2019ll have a pound of lard, please, Madame Quenu.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa placed a sheet of stout paper in the pan of the scales. Then she\r\ntook the lard out of a jar under the shelves with a boxwood spatula,\r\ngently adding small quantities to the fatty heap, which began to melt\r\nand run slightly. When the plate of the scale fell, she took up the\r\npaper, folded it, and rapidly twisted the ends with her finger-tips.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat makes twenty-four sous,\u201D she said; \u201Cthe bacon is six sous\u2014thirty\r\nsous altogether. There\u2019s nothing else you want, is there?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D said La Sarriette, \u201Cnothing.\u201D She paid her money, still laughing\r\nand showing her teeth, and staring the men in the face. Her grey skirt\r\nwas all awry, and her loosely fastened red neckerchief allowed a little\r\nof her white bosom to appear. Before she went away she stepped up to\r\nGavard again, and pretending to threaten him exclaimed: \u201CSo you won\u2019t\r\ntell me what you were talking about as I came in? I could see you\r\nlaughing from the street. Oh, you sly fellow! Ah! I sha\u2019n\u2019t love you\r\nany longer!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she left the shop and ran across the road.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was Mademoiselle Saget who sent her here,\u201D remarked handsome Lisa\r\ndrily.\r\n\r\nThen silence fell again for some moments. Gavard was dismayed at\r\nFlorent\u2019s reception of his proposal. Lisa was the first to speak. \u201CIt\r\nwas wrong of you to refuse the post, Florent,\u201D she said in the most\r\nfriendly tones. \u201CYou know how difficult it is to find any employment,\r\nand you are not in a position to be over-exacting.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have my reasons,\u201D Florent replied.\r\n\r\nLisa shrugged her shoulders. \u201CCome now,\u201D said she, \u201Cyou really can\u2019t be\r\nserious, I\u2019m sure. I can understand that you are not in love with the\r\nGovernment, but it would be too absurd to let your opinions prevent you\r\nfrom earning your living. And, besides, my dear fellow, the Emperor\r\nisn\u2019t at all a bad sort of man. You don\u2019t suppose, do you, that he knew\r\nyou were eating mouldy bread and tainted meat? He can\u2019t be everywhere,\r\nyou know, and you can see for yourself that he hasn\u2019t prevented us here\r\nfrom doing pretty well. You are not at all just; indeed you are not.\u201D\r\n\r\nGavard, however, was getting very fidgety. He could not bear to hear\r\npeople speak well of the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, Madame Quenu,\u201D he interrupted; \u201Cyou are going too far. It is a\r\nscoundrelly system altogether.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, as for you,\u201D exclaimed Lisa vivaciously, \u201Cyou\u2019ll never rest until\r\nyou\u2019ve got yourself plundered and knocked on the head as the result of\r\nall your wild talk. Don\u2019t let us discuss politics; you would only make\r\nme angry. The question is Florent, isn\u2019t it? Well, for my part, I say\r\nthat he ought to accept this inspectorship. Don\u2019t you think so too,\r\nQuenu?\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu, who had not yet said a word, was very much put out by his wife\u2019s\r\nsudden appeal.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a good berth,\u201D he replied, without compromising himself.\r\n\r\nThen, amidst another interval of awkward silence, Florent resumed: \u201CI\r\nbeg you, let us drop the subject. My mind is quite made up. I shall\r\nwait.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou will wait!\u201D cried Lisa, losing patience.\r\n\r\nTwo rosy fires had risen to her cheeks. As she stood there, erect, in\r\nher white apron, with rounded, swelling hips, it was with difficulty\r\nthat she restrained herself from breaking out into bitter words.\r\nHowever, the entrance of another person into the shop arrested her\r\nanger. The new arrival was Madame Lec\u0153ur.\r\n\r\n\u201CCan you let me have half a pound of mixed meats at fifty sous the\r\npound?\u201D she asked.\r\n\r\nShe at first pretended not to notice her brother-in-law; but presently\r\nshe just nodded her head to him, without speaking. Then she scrutinised\r\nthe three men from head to foot, doubtless hoping to divine their\r\nsecret by the manner in which they waited for her to go. She could see\r\nthat she was putting them out, and the knowledge of this rendered her\r\nyet more sour and angular, as she stood there in her limp skirts, with\r\nher long, spider-like arms bent and her knotted fingers clasped beneath\r\nher apron. Then, as she coughed slightly, Gavard, whom the silence\r\nembarrassed, inquired if she had a cold.\r\n\r\nShe curtly answered in the negative. Her tightly stretched skin was of\r\na red-brick colour on those parts of her face where her bones\r\nprotruded, and the dull fire burning in her eyes and scorching their\r\nlids testified to some liver complaint nurtured by the querulous\r\njealousy of her disposition. She turned round again towards the\r\ncounter, and watched each movement made by Lisa as she served her with\r\nthe distrustful glance of one who is convinced that an attempt will be\r\nmade to defraud her.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t give me any saveloy,\u201D she exclaimed; \u201CI don\u2019t like it.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa had taken up a slender knife, and was cutting some thin slices of\r\nsausage. She next passed on to the smoked ham and the common ham,\r\ncutting delicate slices from each, and bending forward slightly as she\r\ndid so, with her eyes ever fixed on the knife. Her plump rosy hands,\r\nflitting about the viands with light and gentle touches, seemed to have\r\nderived suppleness from contact with all the fat.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou would like some larded veal, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201D she asked, bringing a\r\nyellow pan towards her.\r\n\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur seemed to be thinking the matter over at considerable\r\nlength; however, she at last said that she would have some. Lisa had\r\nnow begun to cut into the contents of the pans, from which she removed\r\nslices of larded veal and hare _pat\u00E9_ on the tip of a broad-bladed\r\nknife. And she deposited each successive slice on the middle of a sheet\r\nof paper placed on the scales.\r\n\r\n\u201CAren\u2019t you going to give me some of the boar\u2019s head with pistachio\r\nnuts?\u201D asked Madame Lec\u0153ur in her querulous voice.\r\n\r\nLisa was obliged to add some of the boar\u2019s head. But the butter dealer\r\nwas getting exacting, and asked for two slices of galantine. She was\r\nvery fond of it. Lisa, who was already irritated, played impatiently\r\nwith the handles of the knives, and told her that the galantine was\r\ntruffled, and that she could only include it in an \u201Cassortment\u201D at\r\nthree francs the pound. Madame Lec\u0153ur, however, continued to pry into\r\nthe dishes, trying to find something else to ask for. When the\r\n\u201Cassortment\u201D was weighed she made Lisa add some jelly and gherkins to\r\nit. The block of jelly, shaped like a Savoy cake, shook on its white\r\nchina dish beneath the angry violence of Lisa\u2019s hand; and as with her\r\nfinger-tips she took a couple of gherkins from a jar behind the heater,\r\nshe made the vinegar spurt over the sides.\r\n\r\n\u201CTwenty-five sous, isn\u2019t it?\u201D Madame Lec\u0153ur leisurely inquired.\r\n\r\nShe fully perceived Lisa\u2019s covert irritation, and greatly enjoyed the\r\nsight of it, producing her money as slowly as possible, as though,\r\nindeed, her silver had got lost amongst the coppers in her pocket. And\r\nshe glanced askance at Gavard, relishing the embarrassed silence which\r\nher presence was prolonging, and vowing that she would not go off,\r\nsince they were hiding some trickery or other from her. However, Lisa\r\nat last put the parcel in her hands, and she was then obliged to make\r\nher departure. She went away without saying a word, but darting a\r\nsearching glance all round the shop.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was that Saget who sent her too!\u201D burst out Lisa, as soon as the\r\nold woman was gone. \u201CIs the old wretch going to send the whole market\r\nhere to try to find out what we talk about? What a prying, malicious\r\nset they are! Did anyone ever hear before of crumbed cutlets and\r\n\u2018assortments\u2019 being bought at five o\u2019clock in the afternoon? But then\r\nthey\u2019d rack themselves with indigestion rather than not find out! Upon\r\nmy word, though, if La Saget sends anyone else here, you\u2019ll see the\r\nreception she\u2019ll get. I would bundle her out of the shop, even if she\r\nwere my own sister!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe three men remained silent in presence of this explosion of anger.\r\nGavard had gone to lean over the brass rail of the window-front, where,\r\nseemingly lost in thought, he began playing with one of the cut-glass\r\nbalusters detached from its wire fastening. Presently, however, he\r\nraised his head. \u201CWell, for my part,\u201D he said, \u201CI looked upon it all as\r\nan excellent joke.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLooked upon what as a joke?\u201D asked Lisa, still quivering with\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe inspectorship.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe raised her hands, gave a last glance at Florent, and then sat down\r\nupon the cushioned bench behind the counter and said nothing further.\r\nGavard, however, began to explain his views at length; the drift of his\r\nargument being that it was the Government which would look foolish in\r\nthe matter, since Florent would be taking its money.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy dear fellow,\u201D he said complacently, \u201Cthose scoundrels all but\r\nstarved you to death, didn\u2019t they? Well, you must make them feed you\r\nnow. It\u2019s a splendid idea; it caught my fancy at once!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent smiled, but still persisted in his refusal. Quenu, in the hope\r\nof pleasing his wife, did his best to find some good arguments. Lisa,\r\nhowever, appeared to pay no further attention to them. For the last\r\nmoment or two she had been looking attentively in the direction of the\r\nmarkets. And all at once she sprang to her feet again, exclaiming, \u201CAh!\r\nit is La Normande that they are sending to play the spy on us now!\r\nWell, so much the worse for La Normande; she shall pay for the others!\u201D\r\n\r\nA tall female pushed the shop door open. It was the handsome fish-girl,\r\nLouise Mehudin, generally known as La Normande. She was a bold-looking\r\nbeauty, with a delicate white skin, and was almost as plump as Lisa,\r\nbut there was more effrontery in her glance, and her bosom heaved with\r\nwarmer life. She came into the shop with a light swinging step, her\r\ngold chain jingling on her apron, her bare hair arranged in the latest\r\nstyle, and a bow at her throat, a lace bow, which made her one of the\r\nmost coquettish-looking queens of the markets. She brought a vague\r\nodour of fish with her, and a herring-scale showed like a tiny patch of\r\nmother-of-pearl near the little finger of one of her hands. She and\r\nLisa having lived in the same house in the Rue Pirouette, were intimate\r\nfriends, linked by a touch of rivalry which kept each of them busy with\r\nthoughts of the other. In the neighbourhood people spoke of \u201Cthe\r\nbeautiful Norman,\u201D just as they spoke of \u201Cbeautiful Lisa.\u201D This brought\r\nthem into opposition and comparison, and compelled each of them to do\r\nher utmost to sustain her reputation for beauty. Lisa from her counter\r\ncould, by stooping a little, perceive the fish-girl amidst her salmon\r\nand turbot in the pavilion opposite; and each kept a watch on the\r\nother. Beautiful Lisa laced herself more tightly in her stays; and the\r\nbeautiful Norman replied by placing additional rings on her fingers and\r\nadditional bows on her shoulders. When they met they were very bland\r\nand unctuous and profuse in compliments; but all the while their eyes\r\nwere furtively glancing from under their lowered lids, in the hope of\r\ndiscovering some flaw. They made a point of always dealing with each\r\nother, and professed great mutual affection.\r\n\r\n\u201CI say,\u201D said La Normande, with her smiling air, \u201Cit\u2019s to-morrow\r\nevening that you make your black-puddings, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa maintained a cold demeanour. She seldom showed any anger; but when\r\nshe did it was tenacious, and slow to be appeased. \u201CYes,\u201D she replied\r\ndrily, with the tips of her lips.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m so fond of black-puddings, you know, when they come straight out\r\nof the pot,\u201D resumed La Normande. \u201CI\u2019ll come and get some of you\r\nto-morrow.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was conscious of her rival\u2019s unfriendly greeting. However, she\r\nglanced at Florent, who seemed to interest her; and then, unwilling to\r\ngo off without having the last word, she was imprudent enough to add:\r\n\u201CI bought some black-pudding of you the day before yesterday, you know,\r\nand it wasn\u2019t quite sweet.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot quite sweet!\u201D repeated Lisa, very pale, and her lips quivering.\r\n\r\nShe might, perhaps, have once more restrained herself, for fear of La\r\nNormande imagining that she was overcome by envious spite at the sight\r\nof the lace bow; but the girl, not content with playing the spy,\r\nproceeded to insult her, and that was beyond endurance. So, leaning\r\nforward, with her hands clenched on the counter, she exclaimed, in a\r\nsomewhat hoarse voice: \u201CI say! when you sold me that pair of soles last\r\nweek, did I come and tell you, before everybody that they were\r\nstinking?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CStinking! My soles stinking!\u201D cried the fish dealer, flushing scarlet.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they remained silent, choking with anger, but glaring\r\nfiercely at each other over the array of dishes. All their honeyed\r\nfriendship had vanished; a word had sufficed to reveal what sharp teeth\r\nthere were behind their smiling lips.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re a vulgar, low creature!\u201D cried the beautiful Norman. \u201CYou\u2019ll\r\nnever catch me setting foot in here again, I can tell you!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGet along with you, get along with you,\u201D exclaimed beautiful Lisa. \u201CI\r\nknow quite well whom I\u2019ve got to deal with!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe fish-girl went off, hurling behind her a coarse expression which\r\nleft Lisa quivering. The whole scene had passed so quickly that the\r\nthree men, overcome with amazement, had not had time to interfere. Lisa\r\nsoon recovered herself, and was resuming the conversation, without\r\nmaking any allusion to what had just occurred, when the shop girl,\r\nAugustine, returned from an errand on which she had been sent. Lisa\r\nthereupon took Gavard aside, and after telling him to say nothing for\r\nthe present to Monsieur Verlaque, promised that she would undertake to\r\nconvince her brother-in-law in a couple of days\u2019 time at the utmost.\r\nQuenu then returned to his kitchen, while Gavard took Florent off with\r\nhim. And as they were just going into Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s to drink a\r\ndrop of vermouth together he called his attention to three women\r\nstanding in the covered way between the fish and poultry pavilions.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re cackling together!\u201D he said with an envious air.\r\n\r\nThe markets were growing empty, and Mademoiselle Saget, Madame Lec\u0153ur,\r\nand La Sarriette alone lingered on the edge of the footway. The old\r\nmaid was holding forth.\r\n\r\n\u201CAs I told you before, Madame Lec\u0153ur,\u201D said she, \u201Cthey\u2019ve always got\r\nyour brother-in-law in their shop. You saw him there yourself just now,\r\ndidn\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh yes, indeed! He was sitting on a table, and seemed quite at home.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, for my part,\u201D interrupted La Sarriette, \u201CI heard nothing wrong;\r\nand I can\u2019t understand why you\u2019re making such a fuss.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget shrugged her shoulders. \u201CAh, you\u2019re very innocent\r\nyet, my dear,\u201D she said. \u201CCan\u2019t you see why the Quenus are always\r\nattracting Monsieur Gavard to their place? Well, I\u2019ll wager that he\u2019ll\r\nleave all he has to their little Pauline.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou believe that, do you?\u201D cried Madame Lec\u0153ur, white with rage. Then,\r\nin a mournful voice, as though she had just received some heavy blow,\r\nshe continued: \u201CI am alone in the world, and have no one to take my\r\npart; he is quite at liberty to do as he pleases. His niece sides with\r\nhim too\u2014you heard her just now. She has quite forgotten all that she\r\ncost me, and wouldn\u2019t stir a hand to help me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed, aunt,\u201D exclaimed La Sarriette, \u201Cyou are quite wrong there!\r\nIt\u2019s you who\u2019ve never had anything but unkind words for me.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey became reconciled on the spot, and kissed one another. The niece\r\npromised that she would play no more pranks, and the aunt swore by all\r\nshe held most sacred that she looked upon La Sarriette as her own\r\ndaughter. Then Mademoiselle Saget advised them as to the steps they\r\nought to take to prevent Gavard from squandering his money. And they\r\nall agreed that the Quenu-Gradelles were very disreputable folks, and\r\nrequired closely watching.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re up to just now,\u201D said the old maid, \u201Cbut\r\nthere\u2019s something suspicious going on, I\u2019m sure. What\u2019s your opinion,\r\nnow, of that fellow Florent, that cousin of Madame Quenu\u2019s?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe three women drew more closely together, and lowered their voices.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou remember,\u201D said Madame Lec\u0153ur, \u201Cthat we saw him one morning with\r\nhis boots all split, and his clothes covered with dust, looking just\r\nlike a thief who\u2019s been up to some roguery. That fellow quite frightens\r\nme.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, he\u2019s certainly very thin,\u201D said La Sarriette, \u201Cbut he isn\u2019t\r\nugly.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget was reflecting, and she expressed her thoughts\r\naloud. \u201CI\u2019ve been trying to find out something about him for the last\r\nfortnight, but I can make nothing of it. Monsieur Gavard certainly\r\nknows him. I must have met him myself somewhere before, but I can\u2019t\r\nremember where.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was still ransacking her memory when La Normande swept up to them\r\nlike a whirlwind. She had just left the pork shop.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat big booby Lisa has got nice manners, I must say!\u201D she cried,\r\ndelighted to be able to relieve herself. \u201CFancy her telling me that I\r\nsold nothing but stinking fish! But I gave her as good as she deserved,\r\nI can tell you! A nice den they keep, with their tainted pig meat which\r\npoisons all their customers!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut what had you been saying to her?\u201D asked the old maid, quite frisky\r\nwith excitement, and delighted to hear that the two women had\r\nquarrelled.\r\n\r\n\u201CI! I\u2019d said just nothing at all\u2014no, not that! I just went into the\r\nshop and told her very civilly that I\u2019d buy some black-pudding\r\nto-morrow evening, and then she overwhelmed me with abuse. A dirty\r\nhypocrite she is, with her saint-like airs! But she\u2019ll pay more dearly\r\nfor this than she fancies!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe three women felt that La Normande was not telling them the truth,\r\nbut this did not prevent them from taking her part with a rush of bad\r\nlanguage. They turned towards the Rue Rambuteau with insulting mien,\r\ninventing all sorts of stories about the uncleanliness of the cookery\r\nat the Quenu\u2019s shop, and making the most extraordinary accusations. If\r\nthe Quenus had been detected selling human flesh the women could not\r\nhave displayed more violent and threatening anger. The fish-girl was\r\nobliged to tell her story three times over.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what did the cousin say?\u201D asked Mademoiselle Saget, with wicked\r\nintent.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe cousin!\u201D repeated La Normande, in a shrill voice. \u201CDo you really\r\nbelieve that he\u2019s a cousin? He\u2019s some lover or other, I\u2019ll wager, the\r\ngreat booby!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe three others protested against this. Lisa\u2019s honourability was an\r\narticle of faith in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\u201CStuff and nonsense!\u201D retorted La Normande. \u201CYou can never be sure\r\nabout those smug, sleek hypocrites.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget nodded her head as if to say that she was not very\r\nfar from sharing La Normande\u2019s opinion. And she softly added:\r\n\u201CEspecially as this cousin has sprung from no one knows where; for it\u2019s\r\na very doubtful sort of account that the Quenus give of him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, he\u2019s the fat woman\u2019s sweetheart, I tell you!\u201D reaffirmed the\r\nfish-girl; \u201Csome scamp or vagabond picked up in the streets. It\u2019s easy\r\nenough to see it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe has given him a complete outfit,\u201D remarked Madame Lec\u0153ur. \u201CHe must\r\nbe costing her a pretty penny.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, yes,\u201D muttered the old maid; \u201Cperhaps you are right. I must\r\nreally get to know something about him.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen they all promised to keep one another thoroughly informed of\r\nwhatever might take place in the Quenu-Gradelle establishment. The\r\nbutter dealer pretended that she wished to open her brother-in-law\u2019s\r\neyes as to the sort of places he frequented. However, La Normande\u2019s\r\nanger had by this time toned down, and, a good sort of girl at heart,\r\nshe went off, weary of having talked so much on the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure that La Normande said something or other insolent,\u201D remarked\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur knowingly, when the fish-girl had left them. \u201CIt is just\r\nher way; and it scarcely becomes a creature like her to talk as she did\r\nof Lisa.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe three women looked at each other and smiled. Then, when Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur also had gone off, La Sarriette remarked to Mademoiselle Saget:\r\n\u201CIt is foolish of my aunt to worry herself so much about all these\r\naffairs. It\u2019s that which makes her so thin. Ah! she\u2019d have willingly\r\ntaken Gavard for a husband if she could only have got him. Yet she used\r\nto beat me if ever a young man looked my way.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget smiled once more. And when she found herself alone,\r\nand went back towards the Rue Pirouette, she reflected that those three\r\ncackling hussies were not worth a rope to hang them. She was, indeed, a\r\nlittle afraid that she might have been seen with them, and the idea\r\nsomewhat troubled her, for she realised that it would be bad policy to\r\nfall out with the Quenu-Gradelles, who, after all, were well-to-do\r\nfolks and much esteemed. So she went a little out of her way on purpose\r\nto call at Taboureau the baker\u2019s in the Rue Turbigo\u2014the finest baker\u2019s\r\nshop in the whole neighbourhood. Madame Taboureau was not only an\r\nintimate friend of Lisa\u2019s, but an accepted authority on every subject.\r\nWhen it was remarked that \u201CMadame Taboureau had said this,\u201D or \u201CMadame\r\nTaboureau had said that,\u201D there was no more to be urged. So the old\r\nmaid, calling at the baker\u2019s under pretence of inquiring at what time\r\nthe oven would be hot, as she wished to bring a dish of pears to be\r\nbaked, took the opportunity to eulogise Lisa, and lavish praise upon\r\nthe sweetness and excellence of her black-puddings. Then, well pleased\r\nat having prepared this moral alibi and delighted at having done what\r\nshe could to fan the flames of a quarrel without involving herself in\r\nit, she briskly returned home, feeling much easier in her mind, but\r\nstill striving to recall where she had previously seen Madame Quenu\u2019s\r\nso-called cousin.\r\n\r\nThat same evening, after dinner, Florent went out and strolled for some\r\ntime in one of the covered ways of the markets. A fine mist was rising,\r\nand a grey sadness, which the gas lights studded as with yellow tears,\r\nhung over the deserted pavilions. For the first time Florent began to\r\nfeel that he was in the way, and to recognise the unmannerly fashion in\r\nwhich he, thin and artless, had tumbled into this world of fat people;\r\nand he frankly admitted to himself that his presence was disturbing the\r\nwhole neighbourhood, and that he was a source of discomfort to the\r\nQuenus\u2014a spurious cousin of far too compromising appearance. These\r\nreflections made him very sad; not, indeed, that they had noticed the\r\nslightest harshness on the part of his brother or Lisa: it was their\r\nvery kindness, rather, that was troubling him, and he accused himself\r\nof a lack of delicacy in quartering himself upon them. He was beginning\r\nto doubt the propriety of his conduct. The recollection of the\r\nconversation in the shop during the afternoon caused him a vague\r\ndisquietude. The odour of the viands on Lisa\u2019s counter seemed to\r\npenetrate him; he felt himself gliding into nerveless, satiated\r\ncowardice. Perhaps he had acted wrongly in refusing the inspectorship\r\noffered him. This reflection gave birth to a stormy struggle in his\r\nmind, and he was obliged to brace and shake himself before he could\r\nrecover his wonted rigidity of principles. However, a moist breeze had\r\nrisen, and was blowing along the covered way, and he regained some\r\ndegree of calmness and resolution on being obliged to button up his\r\ncoat. The wind seemingly swept from his clothes all the greasy odour of\r\nthe pork shop, which had made him feel so languid.\r\n\r\nHe was returning home when he met Claude Lantier. The artist, hidden in\r\nthe folds of his greenish overcoat, spoke in a hollow voice full of\r\nsuppressed anger. He was in a passion with painting, declared that it\r\nwas a dog\u2019s trade, and swore that he would not take up a brush again as\r\nlong as he lived. That very afternoon he had thrust his foot through a\r\nstudy which he had been making of the head of that hussy Cadine.\r\n\r\nClaude was subject to these outbursts, the fruit of his inability to\r\nexecute the lasting, living works which he dreamed of. And at such\r\ntimes life became an utter blank to him, and he wandered about the\r\nstreets, wrapped in the gloomiest thoughts, and waiting for the morning\r\nas for a sort of resurrection. He used to say that he felt bright and\r\ncheerful in the morning, and horribly miserable in the evening.[*] Each\r\nof his days was a long effort ending in disappointment. Florent\r\nscarcely recognised in him the careless night wanderer of the markets.\r\nThey had already met again at the pork shop, and Claude, who knew the\r\nfugitive\u2019s story, had grasped his hand and told him that he was a\r\nsterling fellow. It was very seldom, however, that the artist went to\r\nthe Quenus\u2019.\r\n\r\n[*] Claude Lantier\u2019s struggle for fame is fully described in M. Zola\u2019s\r\nnovel, _L\u2019Oeuvre_ (\u201CHis Masterpiece\u201D). \u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you still at my aunt\u2019s?\u201D he asked. \u201CI can\u2019t imagine how you manage\r\nto exist amidst all that cookery. The places reeks with the smell of\r\nmeat. When I\u2019ve been there for an hour I feel as though I shouldn\u2019t\r\nwant anything to eat for another three days. I ought not to have gone\r\nthere this morning; it was that which made me make a mess of my work.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, after he and Florent had taken a few steps in silence, he\r\nresumed:\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! the good people! They quite grieve me with their fine health. I\r\nhad thought of painting their portraits, but I\u2019ve never been able to\r\nsucceed with such round faces, in which there is never a bone. Ah! You\r\nwouldn\u2019t find my aunt Lisa kicking her foot through her pans! I was an\r\nidiot to have destroyed Cadine\u2019s head! Now that I come to think of it,\r\nit wasn\u2019t so very bad, perhaps, after all.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen they began to talk about Aunt Lisa. Claude said that his mother[*]\r\nhad not seen anything of her for a long time, and he hinted that the\r\npork butcher\u2019s wife was somewhat ashamed of her sister having married a\r\ncommon working man; moreover, she wasn\u2019t at all fond of unfortunate\r\nfolks. Speaking of himself, he told Florent that a benevolent gentleman\r\nhad sent him to college, being very pleased with the donkeys and old\r\nwomen that he had managed to draw when only eight years old; but the\r\ngood soul had died, leaving him an income of a thousand francs, which\r\njust saved him from perishing of hunger.\r\n\r\n[*] Gervaise, the heroine of the _Assommoir_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CAll the same, I would rather have been a working man,\u201D continued\r\nClaude. \u201CLook at the carpenters, for instance. They are very happy\r\nfolks, the carpenters. They have a table to make, say; well, they make\r\nit, and then go off to bed, happy at having finished the table, and\r\nperfectly satisfied with themselves. Now I, on the other hand, scarcely\r\nget any sleep at nights. All those confounded pictures which I can\u2019t\r\nfinish go flying about my brain. I never get anything finished and done\r\nwith\u2014never, never!\u201D\r\n\r\nHis voice almost broke into a sob. Then he attempted to laugh; and\r\nafterwards began to swear and pour forth coarse expressions, with the\r\ncold rage of one who, endowed with a delicate, sensitive mind, doubts\r\nhis own powers, and dreams of wallowing in the mire. He ended by\r\nsquatting down before one of the gratings which admit air into the\r\ncellars beneath the markets\u2014cellars where the gas is continually kept\r\nburning. And in the depths below he pointed out Marjolin and Cadine\r\ntranquilly eating their supper, whilst seated on one of the stone\r\nblocks used for killing the poultry. The two young vagabonds had\r\ndiscovered a means of hiding themselves and making themselves at home\r\nin the cellars after the doors had been closed.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a magnificent animal he is, eh!\u201D exclaimed Claude, with envious\r\nadmiration, speaking of Marjolin. \u201CHe and Cadine are happy, at all\r\nevents! All they care for is eating and kissing. They haven\u2019t a care in\r\nthe world. Ah, you do quite right, after all, to remain at the pork\r\nshop; perhaps you\u2019ll grow sleek and plump there.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he suddenly went off. Florent climbed up to his garret, disturbed\r\nby Claude\u2019s nervous restlessness, which revived his own uncertainty. On\r\nthe morrow, he avoided the pork shop all the morning, and went for a\r\nlong walk on the quays. When he returned to lunch, however, he was\r\nstruck by Lisa\u2019s kindliness. Without any undue insistence she again\r\nspoke to him about the inspectorship, as of something which was well\r\nworth his consideration. As he listened to her, with a full plate in\r\nfront of him, he was affected, in spite of himself, by the prim comfort\r\nof his surroundings. The matting beneath his feet seemed very soft; the\r\ngleams of the brass hanging lamp, the soft, yellow tint of the\r\nwallpaper, and the bright oak of the furniture filled him with\r\nappreciation of a life spent in comfort, which disturbed his notions of\r\nright and wrong. He still, however, had sufficient strength to persist\r\nin his refusal, and repeated his reasons; albeit conscious of the bad\r\ntaste he was showing in thus ostentatiously parading his animosity and\r\nobstinacy in such a place. Lisa showed no signs of vexation; on the\r\ncontrary, she smiled, and the sweetness of her smile embarrassed\r\nFlorent far more than her suppressed irritation of the previous\r\nevening. At dinner the subject was not renewed; they talked solely of\r\nthe great winter saltings, which would keep the whole staff of the\r\nestablishment busily employed.\r\n\r\nThe evenings were growing cold, and as soon as they had dined they\r\nretired into the kitchen, where it was very warm. The room was so\r\nlarge, too, that several people could sit comfortably at the square\r\ncentral table, without in any way impeding the work that was going on.\r\nLighted by gas, the walls were coated with white and blue tiles to a\r\nheight of some five or six feet from the floor. On the left was a great\r\niron stove, in the three apertures of which were set three large round\r\npots, their bottoms black with soot. At the end was a small range,\r\nwhich, fitted with an oven and a smoking-place, served for the\r\nbroiling; and up above, over the skimming-spoons, ladles, and\r\nlong-handled forks, were several numbered drawers, containing rasped\r\nbread, both fine and coarse, toasted crumbs, spices, cloves, nutmegs,\r\nand pepper. On the right, leaning heavily against the wall, was the\r\nchopping-block, a huge mass of oak, slashed and scored all over.\r\nAttached to it were several appliances, an injecting pump, a\r\nforcing-machine, and a mechanical mincer, which, with their wheels and\r\ncranks, imparted to the place an uncanny and mysterious aspect,\r\nsuggesting some kitchen of the infernal regions.\r\n\r\nThen, all round the walls upon shelves, and even under the tables, were\r\niron pots, earthenware pans, dishes, pails, various kinds of tin\r\nutensils, a perfect battery of deep copper saucepans, and swelling\r\nfunnels, racks of knives and choppers, rows of larding-pins and\r\nneedles\u2014a perfect world of greasy things. In spite of the extreme\r\ncleanliness, grease was paramount; it oozed forth from between the blue\r\nand white tiles on the wall, glistened on the red tiles of the\r\nflooring, gave a greyish glitter to the stove, and polished the edges\r\nof the chopping-block with the transparent sheen of varnished oak. And,\r\nindeed, amidst the ever-rising steam, the continuous evaporation from\r\nthe three big pots, in which pork was boiling and melting, there was\r\nnot a single nail from ceiling to floor from which grease did not\r\nexude.\r\n\r\nThe Quenu-Gradelles prepared nearly all their stock themselves. All\r\nthat they procured from outside were the potted meats of celebrated\r\nfirms, with jars of pickles and preserves, sardines, cheese, and edible\r\nsnails. They consequently became very busy after September in filling\r\nthe cellars which had been emptied during the summer. They continued\r\nworking even after the shop had been closed for the night. Assisted by\r\nAuguste and Leon, Quenu would stuff sausages-skins, prepare hams, melt\r\ndown lard, and salt the different sorts of bacon. There was a\r\ntremendous noise of cauldrons and cleavers, and the odour of cooking\r\nspread through the whole house. All this was quite independent of the\r\ndaily business in fresh pork, _pat\u00E9 de fois gras_, hare patty,\r\ngalantine, saveloys and black-puddings.\r\n\r\nThat evening, at about eleven o\u2019clock, Quenu, after placing a couple of\r\npots on the fire in order to melt down some lard, began to prepare the\r\nblack-puddings. Auguste assisted him. At one corner of the square table\r\nLisa and Augustine sat mending linen, whilst opposite to them, on the\r\nother side, with his face turned towards the fireplace, was Florent.\r\nLeon was mincing some sausage-meat on the oak block in a slow,\r\nrhythmical fashion.\r\n\r\nAuguste first of all went out into the yard to fetch a couple of\r\njug-like cans full of pigs\u2019 blood. It was he who stuck the animals in\r\nthe slaughter house. He himself would carry away the blood and interior\r\nportions of the pigs, leaving the men who scalded the carcasses to\r\nbring them home completely dressed in their carts. Quenu asserted that\r\nno assistant in all Paris was Auguste\u2019 equal as a pig-sticker. The\r\ntruth was that Auguste was a wonderfully keen judge of the quality of\r\nthe blood; and the black-pudding proved good every time that he said\r\nsuch would be the case.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, will the black-pudding be good this time?\u201D asked Lisa.\r\n\r\nAugust put down the two cans and slowly answered: \u201CI believe so, Madame\r\nQuenu; yes, I believe so. I tell it at first by the way the blood\r\nflows. If it spurts out very gently when I pull out the knife, that\u2019s a\r\nbad sign, and shows that the blood is poor.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut doesn\u2019t that depend on how far the knife has been stuck in?\u201D asked\r\nQuenu.\r\n\r\nA smile came over Auguste\u2019s pale face. \u201CNo,\u201D he replied; \u201CI always let\r\nfour digits of the blade go in; that\u2019s the right way to measure. But\r\nthe best sign of all is when the blood runs out and I beat it with my\r\nhand when it pours into the pail; it ought to be of a good warmth, and\r\ncreamy, without being too thick.\u201D\r\n\r\nAugustine had put down her needle, and with her eyes raised was now\r\ngazing at Auguste. On her ruddy face, crowned by wiry chestnut hair,\r\nthere was an expression of profound attention. Lisa and even little\r\nPauline were also listening with deep interest.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I beat it, and beat it, and beat it,\u201D continued the young man,\r\nwhisking his hand about as though he were whipping cream. \u201CAnd then,\r\nwhen I take my hand out and look at it, it ought to be greased, as it\r\nwere, by the blood and equally coated all over. And if that\u2019s the case,\r\nanyone can say without fear of mistake that the black-puddings will be\r\ngood.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe remained for a moment in an easy attitude, complacently holding his\r\nhand in the air. This hand, which spent so much of its time in pails of\r\nblood, had brightly gleaming nails, and looked very rosy above his\r\nwhite sleeve. Quenu had nodded his head in approbation, and an interval\r\nof silence followed. Leon was still mincing. Pauline, however, after\r\nremaining thoughtful for a little while, mounted upon Florent\u2019s feet\r\nagain, and in her clear voice exclaimed: \u201CI say, cousin, tell me the\r\nstory of the gentleman who was eaten by the wild beasts!\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was probably the mention of the pig\u2019s blood which had aroused in the\r\nchild\u2019s mind the recollection of \u201Cthe gentleman who had been eaten by\r\nthe wild beasts.\u201D Florent did not at first understand what she referred\r\nto, and asked her what gentleman she meant. Lisa began to smile.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe wants you to tell her,\u201D she said, \u201Cthe story of that unfortunate\r\nman\u2014you know whom I mean\u2014which you told to Gavard one evening. She must\r\nhave heard you.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Florent grew very grave. The little girl got up, and taking the\r\nbig cat in her arms, placed it on his knees, saying that Mouton also\r\nwould like to hear the story. Mouton, however, leapt on to the table,\r\nwhere, with rounded back, he remained contemplating the tall, scraggy\r\nindividual who for the last fortnight had apparently afforded him\r\nmatter for deep reflection. Pauline meantime began to grow impatient,\r\nstamping her feet and insisting on hearing the story.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, tell her what she wants,\u201D said Lisa, as the child persisted and\r\nbecame quite unbearable; \u201Cshe\u2019ll leave us in peace then.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent remained silent for a moment longer, with his eyes turned\r\ntowards the floor. Then slowly raising his head he let his gaze rest\r\nfirst on the two women who were plying their needles, and next on Quenu\r\nand Auguste, who were preparing the pot for the black-puddings. The gas\r\nwas burning quietly, the stove diffused a gentle warmth, and all the\r\ngrease of the kitchen glistened in an atmosphere of comfort such as\r\nattends good digestion\r\n\r\nThen, taking little Pauline upon his knee, and smiling a sad smile,\r\nFlorent addressed himself to the child as follows[*]:\u2014\r\n\r\n[*] Florent\u2019s narrative is not romance, but is based on the statements\r\nof several of the innocent victims whom the third Napoleon transported\r\nto Cayenne when wading through blood to the power which he so\r\nmisused.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201COnce upon a time there was a poor man who was sent away, a long, long\r\nway off, right across the sea. On the ship which carried him were four\r\nhundred convicts, and he was thrown among them. He was forced to live\r\nfor five weeks amidst all those scoundrels, dressed like them in coarse\r\ncanvas, and feeding at their mess. Foul insects preyed on him, and\r\nterrible sweats robbed him of all his strength. The kitchen, the\r\nbakehouse, and the engine-room made the orlop deck so terribly hot that\r\nten of the convicts died from it. In the daytime they were sent up in\r\nbatches of fifty to get a little fresh air from the sea; and as the\r\ncrew of the ship feared them, a couple of cannons were pointed at the\r\nlittle bit of deck where they took exercise. The poor fellow was very\r\nglad indeed when his turn to go up came. His terrible perspiration then\r\nabated somewhat; still, he could not eat, and felt very ill. During the\r\nnight, when he was manacled again, and the rolling of the ship in the\r\nrough sea kept knocking him against his companions, he quite broke\r\ndown, and began to cry, glad to be able to do so without being seen.\u201D\r\n\r\nPauline was listening with dilated eyes, and her little hands crossed\r\nprimly in front of her.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut this isn\u2019t the story of the gentleman who was eaten by the wild\r\nbeasts,\u201D she interrupted. \u201CThis is quite a different story; isn\u2019t it\r\nnow, cousin?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWait a bit, and you\u2019ll see,\u201D replied Florent gently. \u201CI shall come to\r\nthe gentleman presently. I\u2019m telling you the whole story from the\r\nbeginning.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, thank you,\u201D murmured the child, with a delighted expression.\r\nHowever, she remained thoughtful, evidently struggling with some great\r\ndifficulty to which she could find no explanation. At last she spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut what had the poor man done,\u201D she asked, \u201Cthat he was sent away and\r\nput in the ship?\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa and Augustine smiled. They were quite charmed with the child\u2019s\r\nintelligence; and Lisa, without giving the little one a direct reply,\r\ntook advantage of the opportunity to teach her a lesson by telling her\r\nthat naughty children were also sent away in boats like that.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, then,\u201D remarked Pauline judiciously, \u201Cperhaps it served my\r\ncousin\u2019s poor man quite right if he cried all night long.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa resumed her sewing, bending over her work. Quenu had not listened.\r\nHe had been cutting some little rounds of onion over a pot placed on\r\nthe fire; and almost at once the onions began to crackle, raising a\r\nclear shrill chirrup like that of grasshoppers basking in the heat.\r\nThey gave out a pleasant odour too, and when Quenu plunged his great\r\nwooden spoon into the pot the chirruping became yet louder, and the\r\nwhole kitchen was filled with the penetrating perfume of the onions.\r\nAuguste meantime was preparing some bacon fat in a dish, and Leon\u2019s\r\nchopper fell faster and faster, and every now and then scraped the\r\nblock so as to gather together the sausage-meat, now almost a paste.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen they got across the sea,\u201D Florent continued, \u201Cthey took the man\r\nto an island called the Devil\u2019s Island,[*] where he found himself\r\namongst others who had been carried away from their own country. They\r\nwere all very unhappy. At first they were kept to hard labour, just\r\nlike convicts. The gendarme who had charge of them counted them three\r\ntimes every day, so as to be sure that none were missing. Later on,\r\nthey were left free to do as they liked, being merely locked up at\r\nnight in a big wooden hut, where they slept in hammocks stretched\r\nbetween two bars. At the end of the year they went about barefooted, as\r\ntheir boots were quite worn out, and their clothes had become so ragged\r\nthat their flesh showed through them. They had built themselves some\r\nhuts with trunks of trees as a shelter against the sun, which is\r\nterribly hot in those parts; but these huts did not shield them against\r\nthe mosquitoes, which covered them with pimples and swellings during\r\nthe night. Many of them died, and the others turned quite yellow, so\r\nshrunken and wretched, with their long, unkempt beards, that one could\r\nnot behold them without pity.\u201D\r\n\r\n[*] The \u00CEle du Diable. This spot was selected as the place of detention\r\nof Captain Dreyfus, the French officer convicted in 1894 of having\r\ndivulged important military documents to foreign powers.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CAuguste, give me the fat,\u201D cried Quenu; and when the apprentice had\r\nhanded him the dish he let the pieces of bacon-fat slide gently into\r\nthe pot, and then stirred them with his spoon. A yet denser steam now\r\nrose from the fireplace.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat did they give them to eat?\u201D asked little Pauline, who seemed\r\ndeeply interested.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey gave them maggoty rice and foul meat,\u201D answered Florent, whose\r\nvoice grew lower as he spoke. \u201CThe rice could scarcely be eaten. When\r\nthe meat was roasted and very well done it was just possible to swallow\r\nit; but if it was boiled, it smelt so dreadfully that the men had\r\nnausea and stomach ache.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019d rather have lived upon dry bread,\u201D said the child, after thinking\r\nthe matter carefully over.\r\n\r\nLeon, having finished the mincing, now placed the sausage-meat upon the\r\nsquare table in a dish. Mouton, who had remained seated with his eyes\r\nfixed upon Florent, as though filled with amazement by his story, was\r\nobliged to retreat a few steps, which he did with a very bad grace.\r\nThen he rolled himself up, with his nose close to the sausage-meat, and\r\nbegan to purr.\r\n\r\nLisa was unable to conceal her disgust and amazement. That foul rice,\r\nthat evil-smelling meat, seemed to her to be scarcely credible\r\nabominations, which disgraced those who had eaten them as much as it\r\ndid those who had provided them; and her calm, handsome face and round\r\nneck quivered with vague fear of the man who had lived upon such horrid\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, indeed, it was not a land of delights,\u201D Florent resumed,\r\nforgetting all about little Pauline, and fixing his dreamy eyes upon\r\nthe steaming pot. \u201CEvery day brought fresh annoyances\u2014perpetual\r\ngrinding tyranny, the violation of every principle of justice, contempt\r\nfor all human charity, which exasperated the prisoners, and slowly\r\nconsumed them with a fever of sickly rancour. They lived like wild\r\nbeasts, with the lash ceaselessly raised over their backs. Those\r\ntorturers would have liked to kill the poor man\u2014Oh, no; it can never be\r\nforgotten; it is impossible! Such sufferings will some day claim\r\nvengeance.\u201D\r\n\r\nHis voice had fallen, and the pieces of fat hissing merrily in the pot\r\ndrowned it with the sound of their boiling. Lisa, however, heard him,\r\nand was frightened by the implacable expression which had suddenly come\r\nover his face; and, recollecting the gentle look which he habitually\r\nwore, she judged him to be a hypocrite.\r\n\r\nFlorent\u2019s hollow voice had brought Pauline\u2019s interest and delight to\r\nthe highest pitch, and she fidgeted with pleasure on his knee.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut the man?\u201D she exclaimed. \u201CGo on about the man!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent looked at her, and then appeared to remember, and smiled his\r\nsad smile again.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe man,\u201D he continued, \u201Cwas weary of remaining on the island, and had\r\nbut one thought\u2014that of making his escape by crossing the sea and\r\nreaching the mainland, whose white coast line could be seen on the\r\nhorizon in clear weather. But it was no easy matter to escape. It was\r\nnecessary that a raft should be built, and as several of the prisoners\r\nhad already made their escape, all the trees on the island had been\r\nfelled to prevent the others from obtaining timber. The island was,\r\nindeed, so bare and naked, so scorched by the blazing sun, that life in\r\nit had become yet more perilous and terrible. However, it occurred to\r\nthe man and two of his companions to employ the timbers of which their\r\nhuts were built; and one evening they put out to sea on some rotten\r\nbeams, which they had fastened together with dry branches. The wind\r\ncarried them towards the coast. Just as daylight was about to appear,\r\nthe raft struck on a sandbank with such violence that the beams were\r\nsevered from their lashings and carried out to sea. The three poor\r\nfellows were almost engulfed in the sand. Two of them sank in it to\r\ntheir waists, while the third disappeared up to his chin, and his\r\ncompanions were obliged to pull him out. At last they reached a rock,\r\nso small that there was scarcely room for them to sit down upon it.\r\nWhen the sun rose they could see the coast in front of them, a bar of\r\ngrey cliffs stretching all along the horizon. Two, who knew how to\r\nswim, determined to reach those cliffs. They preferred to run the risk\r\nof being drowned at once to that of slowly starving on the rock. But\r\nthey promised their companion that they would return for him when they\r\nhad reached land and had been able to procure a boat.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, I know now!\u201D cried little Pauline, clapping her hands with glee.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s the story of the gentleman who was eaten by the crabs!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey succeeded in reaching the coast,\u201D continued Florent, \u201Cbut it was\r\nquite deserted; and it was only at the end of four days that they were\r\nable to get a boat. When they returned to the rock, they found their\r\ncompanion lying on his back, dead, and half-eaten by crabs, which were\r\nstill swarming over what remained of his body.\u201D[*]\r\n\r\n[*] In deference to the easily shocked feelings of the average English\r\nreader I have somewhat modified this passage. In the original M. Zola\r\nfully describes the awful appearance of the body.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nA murmur of disgust escaped Lisa and Augustine, and a horrified grimace\r\npassed over the face of Leon, who was preparing the skins for the\r\nblack-puddings. Quenu stopped in the midst of his work and looked at\r\nAuguste, who seemed to have turned faint. Only little Pauline was\r\nsmiling. In imagination the others could picture those swarming,\r\nravenous crabs crawling all over the kitchen, and mingling gruesome\r\nodours with the aroma of the bacon-fat and onions.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive me the blood,\u201D cried Quenu, who had not been following the story.\r\n\r\nAuguste came up to him with the two cans, from which he slowly poured\r\nthe blood, while Quenu, as it fell, vigorously stirred the now\r\nthickening contents of the pot. When the cans were emptied, Quenu\r\nreached up to one of the drawers above the range, and took out some\r\npinches of spice. Then he added a plentiful seasoning of pepper.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey left him there, didn\u2019t they,\u201D Lisa now asked of Florent, \u201Cand\r\nreturned themselves in safety?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAs they were going back,\u201D continued Florent, \u201Cthe wind changed, and\r\nthey were driven out into the open sea. A wave carried away one of\r\ntheir oars, and the water swept so furiously into the boat that their\r\nwhole time was taken up in baling it out with their hands. They tossed\r\nabout in this way in sight of the coast, carried away by squalls and\r\nthen brought back again by the tide, without a mouthful of bread to\r\neat, for their scanty stock of provisions had been consumed. This went\r\non for three days.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThree days!\u201D cried Lisa in stupefaction; \u201Cthree days without food!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, three days without food. When the east wind at last brought them\r\nto shore, one of them was so weak that he lay on the beach the whole\r\nday. In the evening he died. His companion had vainly attempted to get\r\nhim to chew some leaves which he gathered from the trees.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this point Augustine broke into a slight laugh. Then, ashamed at\r\nhaving done so and not wishing to be considered heartless, she\r\nstammered out in confusion: \u201COh! I wasn\u2019t laughing at that. It was\r\nMouton. Do just look at Mouton, madame.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Lisa in her turn began to smile. Mouton, who had been lying all\r\nthis time with his nose close to the dish of sausage-meat, had probably\r\nbegun to feel distressed and disgusted by the presence of all this\r\nfood, for he had risen and was rapidly scratching the table with his\r\npaws as though he wanted to bury the dish and its contents. At last,\r\nhowever, turning his back to it and lying down on his side, he\r\nstretched himself out, half closing his eyes and rubbing his head\r\nagainst the table with languid pleasure. Then they all began to\r\ncompliment Mouton. He never stole anything, they said, and could be\r\nsafely left with the meat. Pauline related that he licked her fingers\r\nand washed her face after dinner without trying to bite her.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lisa now came back to the question as to whether it were\r\npossible to live for three days without food. In her opinion it was\r\nnot. \u201CNo,\u201D she said, \u201CI can\u2019t believe it. No one ever goes three days\r\nwithout food. When people talk of a person dying of hunger, it is a\r\nmere expression. They always get something to eat, more or less. It is\r\nonly the most abandoned wretches, people who are utterly lost\u2014\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was doubtless going to add, \u201Cvagrant rogues,\u201D but she stopped short\r\nand looked at Florent. The scornful pout of her lips and the expression\r\nof her bright eyes plainly signified that in her belief only villains\r\nmade such prolonged fasts. It seemed to her that a man able to remain\r\nwithout food for three days must necessarily be a very dangerous\r\ncharacter. For, indeed, honest folks never placed themselves in such a\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nFlorent was now almost stifling. In front of him the stove, into which\r\nLeon had just thrown several shovelfuls of coal, was snoring like a lay\r\nclerk asleep in the sun; and the heat was very great. Auguste, who had\r\ntaken charge of the lard melting in the pots, was watching over it in a\r\nstate of perspiration, and Quenu wiped his brow with his sleeve whilst\r\nwaiting for the blood to mix. A drowsiness such as follows gross\r\nfeeding, an atmosphere heavy with indigestion, pervaded the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen the man had buried his comrade in the sand,\u201D Florent continued\r\nslowly, \u201Che walked off alone straight in front of him. Dutch Guiana, in\r\nwhich country he now was, is a land of forests intermingled with rivers\r\nand swamps. The man walked on for more than a week without coming\r\nacross a single human dwelling-place. All around, death seemed to be\r\nlurking and lying in wait for him. Though his stomach was racked by\r\nhunger, he often did not dare to eat the bright-coloured fruits which\r\nhung from the trees; he was afraid to touch the glittering berries,\r\nfearing lest they should be poisonous. For whole days he did not see a\r\npatch of sky, but tramped on beneath a canopy of branches, amidst a\r\ngreenish gloom that swarmed with horrible living creatures. Great birds\r\nflew over his head with a terrible flapping of wings and sudden strange\r\ncalls resembling death groans; apes sprang, wild animals rushed through\r\nthe thickets around him, bending the saplings and bringing down a rain\r\nof leaves, as though a gale were passing. But it was particularly the\r\nserpents that turned his blood cold when, stepping upon a matting of\r\nmoving, withered leaves, he caught sight of their slim heads gliding\r\namidst a horrid maze of roots. In certain nooks, nooks of dank shadow,\r\nswarming colonies of reptiles\u2014some black, some yellow, some purple,\r\nsome striped, some spotted, and some resembling withered reeds\u2014suddenly\r\nawakened into life and wriggled away. At such times the man would stop\r\nand look about for a stone on which he might take refuge from the soft\r\nyielding ground into which his feet sank; and there he would remain for\r\nhours, terror-stricken on espying in some open space near by a boa,\r\nwho, with tail coiled and head erect, swayed like the trunk of a big\r\ntree splotched with gold.\r\n\r\n\u201CAt night he used to sleep in the trees, alarmed by the slightest\r\nrustling of the branches, and fancying that he could hear endless\r\nswarms of serpents gliding through the gloom. He almost stifled beneath\r\nthe interminable expanse of foliage. The gloomy shade reeked with\r\nclose, oppressive heat, a clammy dankness and pestilential sweat,\r\nimpregnated with the coarse aroma of scented wood and malodorous\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd when at last, after a long weary tramp, the man made his way out\r\nof the forest and beheld the sky again, he found himself confronted by\r\nwide rivers which barred his way. He skirted their banks, keeping a\r\nwatchful eye on the grey backs of the alligators and the masses of\r\ndrifting vegetation, and then, when he came to a less\r\nsuspicious-looking spot, he swam across. And beyond the rivers the\r\nforests began again. At other times there were vast prairie lands,\r\nleagues of thick vegetation, in which, at distant intervals, small\r\nlakes gleamed bluely. The man then made a wide detour, and sounded the\r\nground beneath him before advancing, having but narrowly escaped from\r\nbeing swallowed up and buried beneath one of those smiling plains which\r\nhe could hear cracking at each step he took. The giant grass, nourished\r\nby all the collected humus, concealed pestiferous marshes, depths of\r\nliquid mud; and amongst the expanses of verdure spread over the\r\nglaucous immensity to the very horizon there were only narrow stretches\r\nof firm ground with which the traveller must be acquainted if he would\r\navoid disappearing for ever. One night the man sank down as far as his\r\nwaist. At each effort he made to extricate himself the mud threatened\r\nto rise to his mouth. Then he remained quite still for nearly a couple\r\nof hours; and when the moon rose he was fortunately able to catch hold\r\nof a branch of a tree above his head. By the time he reached a human\r\ndwelling his hands and feet were bruised and bleeding, swollen with\r\npoisonous stings. He presented such a pitiable, famished appearance\r\nthat those who saw him were afraid of him. They tossed him some food\r\nfifty yards away from the house, and the master of it kept guard over\r\nhis door with a loaded gun.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent stopped, his voice choked by emotion, and his eyes gazing\r\nblankly before him. For some minutes he had seemed to be speaking to\r\nhimself alone. Little Pauline, who had grown drowsy, was lying in his\r\narms with her head thrown back, though striving to keep her wondering\r\neyes open. And Quenu, for his part, appeared to be getting impatient.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, you stupid!\u201D he shouted to Leon, \u201Cdon\u2019t you know how to hold a\r\nskin yet? What do you stand staring at me for? It\u2019s the skin you should\r\nlook at, not me! There, hold it like that, and don\u2019t move again!\u201D\r\n\r\nWith his right hand Leon was raising a long string of sausage-skin, at\r\none end of which a very wide funnel was inserted; while with his left\r\nhand he coiled the black-pudding round a metal bowl as fast as Quenu\r\nfilled the funnel with big spoonfuls of the meat. The latter, black and\r\nsteaming, flowed through the funnel, gradually inflating the skin,\r\nwhich fell down again, gorged to repletion and curving languidly. As\r\nQuenu had removed the pot from the range both he and Leon stood out\r\nprominently, he broad visaged, and the lad slender of profile, in the\r\nburning glow which cast over their pale faces and white garments a\r\nflood of rosy light.\r\n\r\nLisa and Augustine watched the filling of the skin with great interest,\r\nLisa especially; and she in her turn found fault with Leon because he\r\nnipped the skin too tightly with his fingers, which caused knots to\r\nform, she said. When the skin was quite full, Quenu let it slip gently\r\ninto a pot of boiling water; and seemed quite easy in his mind again,\r\nfor now nothing remained but to leave it to boil.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd the man\u2014go on about the man!\u201D murmured Pauline, opening her eyes,\r\nand surprised at no longer hearing the narrative.\r\n\r\nFlorent rocked her on his knee, and resumed his story in a slow,\r\nmurmuring voice, suggestive of that of a nurse singing an infant to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe man,\u201D he said, \u201Carrived at a large town. There he was at first\r\ntaken for an escaped convict, and was kept in prison for several\r\nmonths. Then he was released, and turned his hand to all sorts of work.\r\nHe kept accounts and taught children to read, and at one time he was\r\neven employed as a navvy in making an embankment. He was continually\r\nhoping to return to his own country. He had saved the necessary amount\r\nof money when he was attacked by yellow fever. Then, believing him to\r\nbe dead, those about him divided his clothes amongst themselves; so\r\nthat when he at last recovered he had not even a shirt left. He had to\r\nbegin all over again. The man was very weak, and was afraid he might\r\nhave to remain where he was. But at last he was able to get away, and\r\nhe returned.\u201D\r\n\r\nHis voice had sunk lower and lower, and now died away altogether in a\r\nfinal quivering of his lips. The close of the story had lulled little\r\nPauline to sleep, and she was now slumbering with her head on Florent\u2019s\r\nshoulder. He held her with one arm, and still gently rocked her on his\r\nknee. No one seemed to pay any further attention to him, so he remained\r\nstill and quiet where he was, holding the sleeping child.\r\n\r\nNow came the tug of war, as Quenu said. He had to remove the\r\nblack-puddings from the pot. In order to avoid breaking them or getting\r\nthem entangled, he coiled them round a thick wooden pin as he drew them\r\nout, and then carried them into the yard and hung them on screens,\r\nwhere they quickly dried. Leon helped him, holding up the drooping\r\nends. And as these reeking festoons of black-pudding crossed the\r\nkitchen they left behind them a trail of odorous steam, which still\r\nfurther thickened the dense atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAuguste, on his side, after giving a hasty glance at the lard moulds,\r\nnow took the covers off the two pots in which the fat was simmering,\r\nand each bursting bubble discharged an acrid vapour into the kitchen.\r\nThe greasy haze had been gradually rising ever since the beginning of\r\nthe evening, and now it shrouded the gas and pervaded the whole room,\r\nstreaming everywhere, and veiling the ruddy whiteness of Quenu and his\r\ntwo assistants. Lisa and Augustine had risen from their seats; and all\r\nwere panting as though they had eaten too much.\r\n\r\nAugustine carried the sleeping Pauline upstairs; and Quenu, who liked\r\nto fasten up the kitchen himself, gave Auguste and Leon leave to go to\r\nbed, saying that he would fetch the black-pudding himself. The younger\r\napprentice stole off with a very red face, having managed to secrete\r\nunder his shirt nearly a yard of the pudding, which must have almost\r\nscalded him. Then the Quenus and Florent remained alone, in silence.\r\nLisa stood nibbling a little piece of the hot pudding, keeping her\r\npretty lips well apart all the while, for fear of burning them, and\r\ngradually the black compound vanished in her rosy mouth.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D said she, \u201CLa Normande was foolish in behaving so rudely; the\r\nblack-pudding\u2019s excellent to-day.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, there was a knock at the passage door, and Gavard, who stayed\r\nat Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s every evening until midnight, came in. He had\r\ncalled for a definite answer about the fish inspectorship.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must understand,\u201D he said, \u201Cthat Monsieur Verlaque cannot wait any\r\nlonger; he is too ill. So Florent must make up his mind. I have\r\npromised to give a positive answer early to-morrow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, Florent accepts,\u201D Lisa quietly remarked, taking another nibble\r\nat some black-pudding.\r\n\r\nFlorent, who had remained in his chair, overcome by a strange feeling\r\nof prostration, vainly endeavoured to rise and protest.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, say nothing,\u201D continued Lisa; \u201Cthe matter is quite settled.\r\nYou have suffered quite enough already, my dear Florent. What you have\r\njust been telling us is enough to make one shudder. It is time now for\r\nyou to settle down. You belong to a respectable family, you received a\r\ngood education, and it is really not fitting that you should go\r\nwandering about the highways like a vagrant. At your age childishness\r\nis no longer excusable. You have been foolish; well, all that will be\r\nforgotten and forgiven. You will take your place again among those of\r\nyour own class\u2014the class of respectable folks\u2014and live in future like\r\nother people.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent listened in astonishment, quite unable to say a word. Lisa was,\r\ndoubtless, right. She looked so healthy, so serene, that it was\r\nimpossible to imagine that she desired anything but what was proper. It\r\nwas he, with his fleshless body and dark, equivocal-looking\r\ncountenance, who must be in the wrong, and indulging in unrighteous\r\ndreams. He could, indeed, no longer understand why he had hitherto\r\nresisted.\r\n\r\nLisa, however, continued to talk to him with an abundant flow of words,\r\nas though he were a little boy found in fault and threatened with the\r\npolice. She assumed, indeed, a most maternal manner, and plied him with\r\nthe most convincing reasons. And at last, as a final argument, she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201CDo it for us, Florent. We occupy a fair position in the neighbourhood\r\nwhich obliges us to use a certain amount of circumspection; and, to\r\ntell you the truth, between ourselves, I\u2019m afraid that people will\r\nbegin to talk. This inspectorship will set everything right; you will\r\nbe somebody; you will even be an honour to us.\u201D\r\n\r\nHer manner had become caressingly persuasive, and Florent was\r\npenetrated by all the surrounding plenteousness, all the aroma filling\r\nthe kitchen, where he fed, as it were, on the nourishment floating in\r\nthe atmosphere. He sank into blissful meanness, born of all the copious\r\nfeeding that went on in the sphere of plenty in which he had been\r\nliving during the last fortnight. He felt, as it were, the titillation\r\nof forming fat which spread slowly all over his body. He experienced\r\nthe languid beatitude of shopkeepers, whose chief concern is to fill\r\ntheir bellies. At this late hour of night, in the warm atmosphere of\r\nthe kitchen, all his acerbity and determination melted away. That\r\npeaceable evening, with the odour of the black-pudding and the lard,\r\nand the sight of plump little Pauline slumbering on his knee, had so\r\nenervated him that he found himself wishing for a succession of such\r\nevenings\u2014endless ones which would make him fat.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was the sight of Mouton that chiefly decided him. Mouton\r\nwas sound asleep, with his stomach turned upwards, one of his paws\r\nresting on his nose, and his tail twisted over this side, as though to\r\nkeep him warm; and he was slumbering with such an expression of feline\r\nhappiness that Florent, as he gazed at him, murmured: \u201CNo, it would be\r\ntoo foolish! I accept the berth. Say that I accept it, Gavard.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Lisa finished eating her black-pudding, and wiped her fingers on\r\nthe edge of her apron. And next she got her brother-in-law\u2019s candle\r\nready for him, while Gavard and Quenu congratulated him on his\r\ndecision. It was always necessary for a man to settle down, said they;\r\nthe breakneck freaks of politics did not provide one with food. And,\r\nmeantime, Lisa, standing there with the lighted candle in her hand,\r\nlooked at him with an expression of satisfaction resting on her\r\nhandsome face, placid like that of some sacred cow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days later the necessary formalities were gone through, and\r\nwithout demur the police authorities at the Prefecture accepted Florent\r\non Monsieur Verlaque\u2019s recommendation as his substitute. Gavard, by the\r\nway, had made it a point to accompany them. When he again found himself\r\nalone with Florent he kept nudging his ribs with his elbow as they\r\nwalked along together, and laughed, without saying anything, while\r\nwinking his eyes in a jeering way. He seemed to find something very\r\nridiculous in the appearance of the police officers whom they met on\r\nthe Quai de l\u2019Horloge, for, as he passed them, he slightly shrugged his\r\nshoulders and made the grimace of a man seeking to restrain himself\r\nfrom laughing in people\u2019s faces.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Monsieur Verlaque began to initiate the new\r\ninspector into the duties of his office. It had been arranged that\r\nduring the next few days he should make him acquainted with the\r\nturbulent sphere which he would have to supervise. Poor Verlaque, as\r\nGavard called him was a pale little man, swathed in flannels,\r\nhandkerchiefs, and mufflers. Constantly coughing, he made his way\r\nthrough the cool, moist atmosphere, and running waters of the fish\r\nmarket, on a pair of scraggy legs like those of a sickly child.\r\n\r\nWhen Florent made his appearance on the first morning, at seven\r\no\u2019clock, he felt quite distracted; his eyes were dazed, his head ached\r\nwith all the noise and riot. Retail dealers were already prowling about\r\nthe auction pavilion; clerks were arriving with their ledgers, and\r\nconsigners\u2019 agents, with leather bags slung over their shoulders, sat\r\non overturned chairs by the salesmen\u2019s desks, waiting to receive their\r\ncash. Fish was being unloaded and unpacked not only in the enclosure,\r\nbut even on the footways. All along the latter were piles of small\r\nbaskets, an endless arrival of cases and hampers, and sacks of mussels,\r\nfrom which streamlets of water trickled. The auctioneers\u2019 assistants,\r\nall looking very busy, sprang over the heaps, tore away the straw at\r\nthe tops of the baskets, emptied the latter, and tossed them aside.\r\nThey then speedily transferred their contents in lots to huge\r\nwickerwork trays, arranging them with a turn of the hand so that they\r\nmight show to the best advantage. And when the large tray-like baskets\r\nwere all set out, Florent could almost fancy that a whole shoal of fish\r\nhad got stranded there, still quivering with life, and gleaming with\r\nrosy nacre, scarlet coral, and milky pearl, all the soft, pale, sheeny\r\nhues of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe deep-lying forests of seaweed, in which the mysterious life of the\r\nocean slumbers, seemed at one haul of the nets to have yielded up all\r\nthey contained. There were cod, keeling, whiting, flounders, plaice,\r\ndabs, and other sorts of common fish of a dingy grey with whitish\r\nsplotches; there were conger-eels, huge serpent-like creatures, with\r\nsmall black eyes and muddy, bluish skins, so slimy that they still\r\nseemed to be gliding along, yet alive. There were broad flat skate with\r\npale undersides edged with a soft red, and superb backs bumpy with\r\nvertebrae, and marbled down to the tautly stretched ribs of their fins\r\nwith splotches of cinnabar, intersected by streaks of the tint of\r\nFlorentine bronze\u2014a dark medley of colour suggestive of the hues of a\r\ntoad or some poisonous flower. Then, too, there were hideous dog-fish,\r\nwith round heads, widely-gaping mouths like those of Chinese idols, and\r\nshort fins like bats\u2019 wings; fit monsters to keep yelping guard over\r\nthe treasures of the ocean grottoes. And next came the finer fish,\r\ndisplayed singly on the osier trays; salmon that gleamed like chased\r\nsilver, every scale seemingly outlined by a graving-tool on a polished\r\nmetal surface; mullet with larger scales and coarser markings; large\r\nturbot and huge brill with firm flesh white like curdled milk;\r\ntunny-fish, smooth and glossy, like bags of blackish leather; and\r\nrounded bass, with widely gaping mouths which a soul too large for the\r\nbody seemed to have rent asunder as it forced its way out amidst the\r\nstupefaction of death. And on all sides there were sole, brown and\r\ngrey, in pairs; sand-eels, slim and stiff, like shavings of pewter;\r\nherrings, slightly twisted, with bleeding gills showing on their\r\nsilver-worked skins; fat dories tinged with just a suspicion of\r\ncarmine; burnished mackerel with green-streaked backs, and sides\r\ngleaming with ever-changing iridescence; and rosy gurnets with white\r\nbellies, their head towards the centre of the baskets and their tails\r\nradiating all around, so that they simulated some strange florescence\r\nsplotched with pearly white and brilliant vermilion. There were rock\r\nmullet, too, with delicious flesh, flushed with the pinky tinge\r\npeculiar to the Cyprinus family; boxes of whiting with opaline\r\nreflections; and baskets of smelts\u2014neat little baskets, pretty as those\r\nused for strawberries, and exhaling a strong scent of violets. And\r\nmeantime the tiny black eyes of the shrimps dotted as with beads of jet\r\ntheir soft-toned mass of pink and grey; and spiny crawfish and lobsters\r\nstriped with black, all still alive, raised a grating sound as they\r\ntried to crawl along with their broken claws.\r\n\r\nFlorent gave but indifferent attention to Monsieur Verlaque\u2019s\r\nexplanations. A flood of sunshine suddenly streamed through the lofty\r\nglass roof of the covered way, lighting up all these precious colours,\r\ntoned and softened by the waves\u2014the iridescent flesh-tints of the\r\nshell-fish, the opal of the whiting, the pearly nacre of the mackerel,\r\nthe ruddy gold of the mullets, the plated skins of the herrings, and\r\nmassive silver of the salmon. It was as though the jewel-cases of some\r\nsea-nymph had been emptied there\u2014a mass of fantastical, undreamt-of\r\nornaments, a streaming and heaping of necklaces, monstrous bracelets,\r\ngigantic brooches, barbaric gems and jewels, the use of which could not\r\nbe divined. On the backs of the skate and the dog-fish you saw, as it\r\nwere, big dull green and purple stones set in dark metal, while the\r\nslender forms of the sand-eels and the tails and fins of the smelts\r\ndisplayed all the delicacy of finely wrought silver-work.\r\n\r\nAnd meantime Florent\u2019s face was fanned by a fresh breeze, a sharp, salt\r\nbreeze redolent of the sea. It reminded him of the coasts of Guiana and\r\nhis voyages. He half fancied that he was gazing at some bay left dry by\r\nthe receding tide, with the seaweed steaming in the sun, the bare rocks\r\ndrying, and the beach smelling strongly of the brine. All around him\r\nthe fish in their perfect freshness exhaled a pleasant perfume, that\r\nslightly sharp, irritating perfume which depraves the appetite.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Verlaque coughed. The dampness was affecting him, and he\r\nwrapped his muffler more closely about his neck.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow,\u201D said he, \u201Cwe will pass on to the fresh water fish.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis was in a pavilion beside the fruit market, the last one, indeed,\r\nin the direction of the Rue Rambuteau. On either side of the space\r\nreserved for the auctions were large circular stone basins, divided\r\ninto separate compartments by iron gratings. Slender streams of water\r\nflowed from brass jets shaped like swan\u2019s necks; and the compartments\r\nwere filled with swarming colonies of crawfish, black-backed carp ever\r\non the move, and mazy tangles of eels, incessantly knotting and\r\nunknotting themselves. Again was Monsieur Verlaque attacked by an\r\nobstinate fit of coughing. The moisture of the atmosphere was more\r\ninsipid here than amongst the sea water fish: there was a riverside\r\nscent, as of sun-warmed water slumbering on a bed of sand.\r\n\r\nA great number of crawfishes had arrived from Germany that morning in\r\ncases and hampers, and the market was also crowded with river fish from\r\nHolland and England. Several men were unpacking shiny carp from the\r\nRhine, lustrous with ruddy metallic hues, their scales resembling\r\nbronzed _cloisonne_ enamel; and others were busy with huge pike, the\r\ncruel iron-grey brigands of the waters, who ravenously protruded their\r\nsavage jaws; or with magnificent dark-hued with verdigris. And amidst\r\nthese suggestions of copper, iron, and bronze, the gudgeon and perch,\r\nthe trout, the bleak, and the flat-fish taken in sweep-nets showed\r\nbrightly white, the steel-blue tints of their backs gradually toning\r\ndown to the soft transparency of their bellies. However, it was the fat\r\nsnowy-white barbel that supplied the liveliest brightness in this\r\ngigantic collection of still life.\r\n\r\nBags of young carp were being gently emptied into the basins. The fish\r\nspun round, then remained motionless for a moment, and at last shot\r\naway and disappeared. Little eels were turned out of their hampers in a\r\nmass, and fell to the bottom of the compartments like tangled knots of\r\nsnakes; while the larger ones\u2014those whose bodies were about as thick as\r\na child\u2019s arm\u2014raised their heads and slipped of their own accord into\r\nthe water with the supple motion of serpents gliding into the\r\nconcealment of a thicket. And meantime the other fish, whose death\r\nagony had been lasting all the morning as they lay on the soiled osiers\r\nof the basket-trays, slowly expired amidst all the uproar of the\r\nauctions, opening their mouths as though to inhale the moisture of the\r\nair, with great silent gasps, renewed every few seconds.\r\n\r\nHowever, Monsieur Verlaque brought Florent back to the salt water fish.\r\nHe took him all over the place and gave him the minutest particulars\r\nabout everything. Round the nine salesmen\u2019s desks ranged along three\r\nsides of the pavilion there was now a dense crowd of surging, swaying\r\nheads, above which appeared the clerks, perched upon high chairs and\r\nmaking entries in their ledgers.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre all these clerks employed by the salesmen?\u201D asked Florent.\r\n\r\nBy way of reply Monsieur Verlaque made a detour along the outside\r\nfootway, led him into the enclosure of one of the auctions, and then\r\nexplained the working of the various departments of the big yellow\r\noffice, which smelt strongly of fish and was stained all over by\r\ndrippings and splashings from the hampers. In a little glazed\r\ncompartment up above, the collector of the municipal dues took note of\r\nthe prices realised by the different lots of fish. Lower down, seated\r\nupon high chairs and with their wrists resting upon little desks, were\r\ntwo female clerks, who kept account of the business on behalf of the\r\nsalesmen. At each end of the stone table in front of the office was a\r\ncrier who brought the basket-trays forward in turn, and in a bawling\r\nvoice announced what each lot consisted of; while above him the female\r\nclerk, pen in hand, waited to register the price at which the lots were\r\nknocked down. And outside the enclosure, shut up in another little\r\noffice of yellow wood, Monsieur Verlaque showed Florent the cashier, a\r\nfat old woman, who was ranging coppers and five-franc pieces in piles.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is a double control, you see,\u201D said Monsieur Verlaque; \u201Cthe\r\ncontrol of the Prefecture of the Seine and that of the Prefecture of\r\nPolice. The latter, which licenses the salesmen, claims to have the\r\nright of supervision over them; and the municipality asserts its right\r\nto be represented at the transactions as they are subject to taxation.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe went on expatiating at length in his faint cold voice respecting the\r\nrival claims of the two Prefectures. Florent, however, was paying but\r\nlittle heed, his attention being concentrated on a female clerk sitting\r\non one of the high chairs just in front of him. She was a tall, dark\r\nwoman of thirty, with big black eyes and an easy calmness of manner,\r\nand she wrote with outstretched fingers like a girl who had been taught\r\nthe regulation method of the art.\r\n\r\nHowever, Florent\u2019s attention was diverted by the yelping of the crier,\r\nwho was just offering a magnificent turbot for sale.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve a bid of thirty francs! Thirty francs, now; thirty francs!\u201D\r\n\r\nHe repeated these words in all sorts of keys, running up and down a\r\nstrange scale of notes full of sudden changes. Humpbacked and with his\r\nface twisted askew, and his hair rough and disorderly, he wore a great\r\nblue apron with a bib; and with flaming eyes and outstretched arms he\r\ncried vociferously: \u201CThirty-one! thirty-two! thirty-three! Thirty-three\r\nfrancs fifty centimes! thirty-three fifty!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he paused to take breath, turning the basket-tray and pushing it\r\nfarther upon the table. The fish-wives bent forward and gently touched\r\nthe turbot with their finger-tips. Then the crier began again with\r\nrenewed energy, hurling his figures towards the buyers with a wave of\r\nthe hand and catching the slightest indication of a fresh bid\u2014the\r\nraising of a finger, a twist of the eyebrows, a pouting of the lips, a\r\nwink, and all with such rapidity and such a ceaseless jumble of words\r\nthat Florent, utterly unable to follow him, felt quite disconcerted\r\nwhen, in a sing-song voice like that of a priest intoning the final\r\nwords of a versicle, he chanted: \u201CForty-two! forty-two! The turbot goes\r\nfor forty-two francs.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was the beautiful Norman who had made the last bid. Florent\r\nrecognised her as she stood in the line of fish-wives crowding against\r\nthe iron rails which surrounded the enclosure. The morning was fresh\r\nand sharp, and there was a row of tippets above the display of big\r\nwhite aprons, covering the prominent bosoms and stomachs and sturdy\r\nshoulders. With high-set chignon set off with curls, and white and\r\ndainty skin, the beautiful Norman flaunted her lace bow amidst tangled\r\nshocks of hair covered with dirty kerchiefs, red noses eloquent of\r\ndrink, sneering mouths, and battered faces suggestive of old pots. And\r\nshe also recognised Madame Quenu\u2019s cousin, and was so surprised to see\r\nhim there that she began gossiping to her neighbours about him.\r\n\r\nThe uproar of voices had become so great that Monsieur Verlaque\r\nrenounced all further attempt to explain matters to Florent. On the\r\nfootway close by, men were calling out the larger fish with prolonged\r\nshouts, which sounded as though they came from gigantic\r\nspeaking-trumpets; and there was one individual who roared \u201CMussels!\r\nMussels!\u201D in such a hoarse, cracked, clamorous voice that the very\r\nroofs of the market shook. Some sacks of mussels were turned upside\r\ndown, and their contents poured into hampers, while others were emptied\r\nwith shovels. And there was a ceaseless procession of basket-trays\r\ncontaining skate, soles, mackerel, conger-eels, and salmon, carried\r\nbackwards and forwards amidst the ever-increasing cackle and pushing of\r\nthe fish-women as they crowded against the iron rails which creaked\r\nwith their pressure. The humpbacked crier, now fairly on the job, waved\r\nhis skinny arms in the air and protruded his jaws. Presently, seemingly\r\nlashed into a state of frenzy by the flood of figures that spurted from\r\nhis lips, he sprang upon a stool, where, with his mouth twisted\r\nspasmodically and his hair streaming behind him, he could force nothing\r\nmore than unintelligible hisses from his parched throat. And in the\r\nmeantime, up above, the collector of municipal dues, a little old man,\r\nmuffled in a collar of imitation astrachan, remained with nothing but\r\nhis nose showing under his black velvet skullcap. And the tall,\r\ndark-complexioned female clerk, with eyes shining calmly in her face,\r\nwhich had been slightly reddened by the cold, sat on her high wooden\r\nchair, quietly writing, apparently unruffled by the continuous rattle\r\nwhich came from the hunchback below her.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat fellow Logre is wonderful,\u201D muttered Monsieur Verlaque with a\r\nsmile. \u201CHe is the best crier in the markets. I believe he could make\r\npeople buy boot soles in the belief they were fish!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he and Florent went back into the pavilion. As they again passed\r\nthe spot where the fresh water fish was being sold by auction, and\r\nwhere the bidding seemed much quieter, Monsieur Verlaque explained that\r\nFrench river fishing was in a bad way.[*] The crier here, a fair,\r\nsorry-looking fellow, who scarcely moved his arms, was disposing of\r\nsome lots of eels and crawfish in a monotonous voice, while the\r\nassistants fished fresh supplies out of the stone basins with their\r\nshort-handled nets.\r\n\r\n[*] M. Zola refers, of course, to the earlier years of the Second\r\nEmpire. Under the present republican Government, which has largely\r\nfostered fish culture, matters have considerably improved.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the crowd round the salesmen\u2019s desks was still increasing.\r\nMonsieur Verlaque played his part as Florent\u2019s instructor in the most\r\nconscientious manner, clearing the way by means of his elbows, and\r\nguiding his successor through the busiest parts. The upper-class retail\r\ndealers were there, quietly waiting for some of the finer fish, or\r\nloading the porters with their purchases of turbot, tunny, and salmon.\r\nThe street-hawkers who had clubbed together to buy lots of herrings and\r\nsmall flat-fish were dividing them on the pavement. There were also\r\nsome people of the smaller middle class, from distant parts of the\r\ncity, who had come down at four o\u2019clock in the morning to buy a really\r\nfresh fish, and had ended by allowing some enormous lot, costing from\r\nforty to fifty francs, to be knocked down to them, with the result that\r\nthey would be obliged to spend the whole day in getting their friends\r\nand acquaintances to take the surplus off their hands. Every now and\r\nthen some violent pushing would force a gap through part of the crowd.\r\nA fish-wife, who had got tightly jammed, freed herself, shaking her\r\nfists and pouring out a torrent of abuse. Then a compact mass of people\r\nagain collected, and Florent, almost suffocated, declared that he had\r\nseen quite enough, and understood all that was necessary.\r\n\r\nAs Monsieur Verlaque was helping him to extricate himself from the\r\ncrowd, they found themselves face to face with the handsome Norman. She\r\nremained stock-still in front of them, and with her queenly air\r\ninquired:\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, is it quite settled? You are going to desert us, Monsieur\r\nVerlaque?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, yes,\u201D replied the little man; \u201CI am going to take a rest in the\r\ncountry, at Clamart. The smell of the fish is bad for me, it seems.\r\nHere, this is the gentleman who is going to take my place.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo speaking he turned round to introduce Florent to her. The handsome\r\nNorman almost choked; however, as Florent went off, he fancied he could\r\nhear her whisper to her neighbours, with a laugh: \u201CWell, we shall have\r\nsome fine fun now, see if we don\u2019t!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe fish-wives had begun to set out their stalls. From all the taps at\r\nthe corners of the marble slabs water was gushing freely; and there was\r\na rustling sound all round, like the plashing of rain, a streaming of\r\nstiff jets of water hissing and spurting. And then, from the lower side\r\nof the sloping slabs, great drops fell with a softened murmur,\r\nsplashing on the flagstones where a mass of tiny streams flowed along\r\nhere and there, turning holes and depressions into miniature lakes, and\r\nafterwards gliding in a thousand rills down the slope towards the Rue\r\nRambuteau. A moist haze ascended, a sort of rainy dust, bringing fresh\r\nwhiffs of air to Florent\u2019s face, whiffs of that salt, pungent sea\r\nbreeze which he remembered so well; while in such fish as was already\r\nlaid out he once more beheld the rosy nacres, gleaming corals, and\r\nmilky pearls, all the rippling colour and glaucous pallidity of the\r\nocean world.\r\n\r\nThat first morning left him much in doubt; indeed, he regretted that he\r\nhad yielded to Lisa\u2019s insistence. Ever since his escape from the greasy\r\ndrowsiness of the kitchen he had been accusing himself of base weakness\r\nwith such violence that tears had almost risen in his eyes. But he did\r\nnot dare to go back on his word. He was a little afraid of Lisa, and\r\ncould see the curl of her lips and the look of mute reproach upon her\r\nhandsome face. He felt that she was too serious a woman to be trifled\r\nwith. However, Gavard happily inspired him with a consoling thought. On\r\nthe evening of the day on which Monsieur Verlaque had conducted him\r\nthrough the auction sales, Gavard took him aside and told him, with a\r\ngood deal of hesitation, that \u201Cthe poor devil\u201D was not at all well off.\r\nAnd after various remarks about the scoundrelly Government which ground\r\nthe life out of its servants without allowing them even the means to\r\ndie in comfort, he ended by hinting that it would be charitable on\r\nFlorent\u2019s part to surrender a part of his salary to the old inspector.\r\nFlorent welcomed the suggestion with delight. It was only right, he\r\nconsidered, for he looked upon himself simply as Monsieur Verlaque\u2019s\r\ntemporary substitute; and besides, he himself really required nothing,\r\nas he boarded and lodged with his brother. Gavard added that he thought\r\nif Florent gave up fifty francs out of the hundred and fifty which he\r\nwould receive monthly, the arrangement would be everything that could\r\nbe desired; and, lowering his voice, he added that it would not be for\r\nlong, for the poor fellow was consumptive to his very bones. Finally it\r\nwas settled that Florent should see Monsieur Verlaque\u2019s wife, and\r\narrange matters with her, to avoid any possibility of hurting the old\r\nman\u2019s feelings.\r\n\r\nThe thought of this kindly action afforded Florent great relief, and he\r\nnow accepted his duties with the object of doing good, thus continuing\r\nto play the part which he had been fulfilling all his life. However, he\r\nmade the poultry dealer promise that he would not speak of the matter\r\nto anyone; and as Gavard also felt a vague fear of Lisa, he kept the\r\nsecret, which was really very meritorious in him.\r\n\r\nAnd now the whole pork shop seemed happy. Handsome Lisa manifested the\r\ngreatest friendliness towards her brother-in-law. She took care that he\r\nwent to bed early, so as to be able to rise in good time; she kept his\r\nbreakfast hot for him; and she no longer felt ashamed at being seen\r\ntalking to him on the footway, now that he wore a laced cap. Quenu,\r\nquite delighted by all these good signs, sat down to table in the\r\nevening between his wife and brother with a lighter heart than ever.\r\nThey often lingered over dinner till nine o\u2019clock, leaving the shop in\r\nAugustine\u2019s charge, and indulging in a leisurely digestion interspersed\r\nwith gossip about the neighbourhood, and the dogmatic opinions of Lisa\r\non political topics; Florent also had to relate how matters had gone in\r\nthe fish market that day. He gradually grew less frigid, and began to\r\ntaste the happiness of a well-regulated existence. There was a\r\nwell-to-do comfort and trimness about the light yellowish dining room\r\nwhich had a softening influence upon him as soon as he crossed its\r\nthreshold. Handsome Lisa\u2019s kindly attentions wrapped him, as it were,\r\nin cotton-wool; and mutual esteem and concord reigned paramount.\r\n\r\nGavard, however, considered the Quenu-Gradelles\u2019 home to be too drowsy.\r\nHe forgave Lisa her weakness for the Emperor, because, he said, one\r\nought never to discuss politics with women, and beautiful Madame Quenu\r\nwas, after all, a very worthy person, who managed her business\r\nadmirably. Nevertheless, he much preferred to spend his evenings at\r\nMonsieur Lebigre\u2019s, where he met a group of friends who shared his own\r\nopinions. Thus when Florent was appointed to the inspectorship of the\r\nfish market, Gavard began to lead him astray, taking him off for hours,\r\nand prompting him to lead a bachelor\u2019s life now that he had obtained a\r\nberth.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lebigre was the proprietor of a very fine establishment,\r\nfitted up in the modern luxurious style. Occupying the right-hand\r\ncorner of the Rue Pirouette, and looking on to the Rue Rambuteau, it\r\nformed, with its four small Norwegian pines in green-painted tubs\r\nflanking the doorway, a worthy pendant to the big pork shop of the\r\nQuenu-Gradelles. Through the clear glass windows you could see the\r\ninterior, which was decorated with festoons of foliage, vine branches,\r\nand grapes, painted on a soft green ground. The floor was tiled with\r\nlarge black and white squares. At the far end was the yawning cellar\r\nentrance, above which rose a spiral staircase hung with red drapery,\r\nand leading to the billiard-room on the first floor. The counter or\r\n\u201Cbar\u201D on the right looked especially rich, and glittered like polished\r\nsilver. Its zinc-work, hanging with a broad bulging border over the\r\nsub-structure of white and red marble, edged it with a rippling sheet\r\nof metal as if it were some high altar laden with embroidery. At one\r\nend, over a gas stove, stood porcelain pots, decorated with circles of\r\nbrass, and containing punch and hot wine. At the other extremity was a\r\ntall and richly sculptured marble fountain, from which a fine stream of\r\nwater, so steady and continuous that it looked as though it were\r\nmotionless, flowed into a basin. In the centre, edged on three sides by\r\nthe sloping zinc surface of the counter, was a second basin for rinsing\r\nand cooling purposes, where quart bottles of draught wine, partially\r\nempty, reared their greenish necks. Then on the counter, to the right\r\nand left of this central basin, were batches of glasses symmetrically\r\narranged: little glasses for brandy, thick tumblers for draught wine,\r\ncup glasses for brandied fruits, glasses for absinthe, glass mugs for\r\nbeer, and tall goblets, all turned upside down and reflecting the\r\nglitter of the counter. On the left, moreover, was a metal urn, serving\r\nas a receptacle for gratuities; whilst a similar one on the right\r\nbristled with a fan-like arrangement of coffee spoons.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lebigre was generally to be found enthroned behind his counter\r\nupon a seat covered with buttoned crimson leather. Within easy reach of\r\nhis hand were the liqueurs in cut-glass decanters protruding from the\r\ncompartments of a stand. His round back rested against a huge mirror\r\nwhich completely filled the panel behind him; across it ran two glass\r\nshelves supporting an array of jars and bottles. Upon one of them the\r\nglass jars of preserved fruits, cherries, plums, and peaches, stood out\r\ndarkly; while on the other, between symmetrically arranged packets of\r\nfinger biscuits, were bright flasks of soft green and red and yellow\r\nglass, suggesting strange mysterious liqueurs, or floral extracts of\r\nexquisite limpidity. Standing on the glass shelf in the white glow of\r\nthe mirror, these flasks, flashing as if on fire, seemed to be\r\nsuspended in the air.\r\n\r\nTo give his premises the appearance of a caf\u00E9, Monsieur Lebigre had\r\nplaced two small tables of bronzed iron and four chairs against the\r\nwall, in front of the counter. A chandelier with five lights and\r\nfrosted globes hung down from the ceiling. On the left was a round gilt\r\ntimepiece, above a _tourniquet_[*] fixed to the wall. Then at the far\r\nend came the private \u201Ccabinet,\u201D a corner of the shop shut off by a\r\npartition glazed with frosted glass of a small square pattern. In the\r\ndaytime this little room received a dim light from a window that looked\r\non to the Rue Pirouette; and in the evening, a gas jet burnt over the\r\ntwo tables painted to resemble marble. It was there that Gavard and his\r\npolitical friends met each evening after dinner. They looked upon\r\nthemselves as being quite at home there, and had prevailed on the\r\nlandlord to reserve the place for them. When Monsieur Lebigre had\r\nclosed the door of the glazed partition, they knew themselves to be so\r\nsafely screened from intrusion that they spoke quite unreservedly of\r\nthe great \u201Csweep out\u201D which they were fond of discussing. No\r\nunprivileged customer would have dared to enter.\r\n\r\n[*] This is a kind of dial turning on a pivot, and usually enclosed in\r\na brass frame, from which radiate a few small handles or spokes. Round\r\nthe face of the dial\u2014usually of paper\u2014are various numerals, and between\r\nthe face and its glass covering is a small marble or wooden ball. The\r\nappliance is used in lieu of dice or coins when two or more customers\r\nare \u201Ctossing\u201D for drinks. Each in turn sends the dial spinning round,\r\nand wins or loses according to the numeral against which the ball rests\r\nwhen the dial stops. As I can find no English name for the appliance, I\r\nhave thought it best to describe it.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first day that Gavard took Florent off he gave him some\r\nparticulars of Monsieur Lebigre. He was a good fellow, he said, who\r\nsometimes came to drink his coffee with them; and, as he had said one\r\nday that he had fought in \u201848, no one felt the least constraint in his\r\npresence. He spoke but little, and seemed rather thick-headed. As the\r\ngentlemen passed him on their way to the private room they grasped his\r\nhand in silence across the glasses and bottles. By his side on the\r\ncrimson leather seat behind the counter there was generally a fair\r\nlittle woman, whom he had engaged as counter assistant in addition to\r\nthe white-aproned waiter who attended to the tables and the\r\nbilliard-room. The young woman\u2019s name was Rose, and she seemed a very\r\ngentle and submissive being. Gavard, with a wink of his eye, told\r\nFlorent that he fancied Lebigre had a weakness for her. It was she, by\r\nthe way, who waited upon the friends in the private room, coming and\r\ngoing, with her happy, humble air, amidst the stormiest political\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nUpon the day on which the poultry dealer took Florent to Lebigre\u2019s to\r\npresent him to his friends, the only person whom the pair found in the\r\nlittle room when they entered it was a man of some fifty years of age,\r\nof a mild and thoughtful appearance. He wore a rather shabby-looking\r\nhat and a long chestnut-coloured overcoat, and sat, with his chin\r\nresting on the ivory knob of a thick cane, in front of a glass mug full\r\nof beer. His mouth was so completely concealed by a vigorous growth of\r\nbeard that his face had a dumb, lipless appearance.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow are you, Robine?\u201D exclaimed Gavard.\r\n\r\nRobine silently thrust out his hand, without making any reply, though\r\nhis eyes softened into a slight smile of welcome. Then he let his chin\r\ndrop on to the knob of his cane again, and looked at Florent over his\r\nbeer. Florent had made Gavard swear to keep his story a secret for fear\r\nof some dangerous indiscretion; and he was not displeased to observe a\r\ntouch of distrust in the discreet demeanour of the gentleman with the\r\nheavy beard. However, he was really mistaken in this, for Robine never\r\ntalked more than he did now. He was always the first to arrive, just as\r\nthe clock struck eight; and he always sat in the same corner, never\r\nletting go his hold of his cane, and never taking off either his hat or\r\nhis overcoat. No one had ever seen him without his hat upon his head.\r\nHe remained there listening to the talk of the others till midnight,\r\ntaking four hours to empty his mug of beer, and gazing successively at\r\nthe different speakers as though he heard them with his eyes. When\r\nFlorent afterwards questioned Gavard about Robine, the poultry dealer\r\nspoke of the latter as though he held him in high esteem. Robine, he\r\nasserted, was an extremely clever and able man, and, though he was\r\nunable to say exactly where he had given proof of his hostility to the\r\nestablished order of things, he declared that he was one of the most\r\ndreaded of the Government\u2019s opponents. He lived in the Rue Saint Denis,\r\nin rooms to which no one as a rule could gain admission. The poultry\r\ndealer, however, asserted that he himself had once been in them. The\r\nwax floors, he said, were protected by strips of green linen; and there\r\nwere covers over the furniture, and an alabaster timepiece with\r\ncolumns. He had caught a glimpse of the back of a lady, who was just\r\ndisappearing through one doorway as he was entering by another, and had\r\ntaken her to be Madame Robine. She appeared to be an old lady of very\r\ngenteel appearance, with her hair arranged in corkscrew curls; but of\r\nthis he could not be quite certain. No one knew why they had taken up\r\ntheir abode amidst all the uproar of a business neighbourhood; for the\r\nhusband did nothing at all, spending his days no one knew how and\r\nliving on no one knew what, though he made his appearance every evening\r\nas though he were tired but delighted with some excursion into the\r\nhighest regions of politics.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, have you read the speech from the throne?\u201D asked Gavard, taking\r\nup a newspaper that was lying on the table.\r\n\r\nRobine shrugged his shoulders. Just at that moment, however, the door\r\nof the glazed partition clattered noisily, and a hunchback made his\r\nappearance. Florent at once recognised the deformed crier of the fish\r\nmarket, though his hands were now washed and he was neatly dressed,\r\nwith his neck encircled by a great red muffler, one end of which hung\r\ndown over his hump like the skirt of a Venetian cloak.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, here\u2019s Logre!\u201D exclaimed the poultry dealer. \u201CNow we shall hear\r\nwhat he thinks about the speech from the throne.\u201D\r\n\r\nLogre, however, was apparently furious. To begin with he almost broke\r\nthe pegs off in hanging up his hat and muffler. Then he threw himself\r\nviolently into a chair, and brought his fist down on the table, while\r\ntossing away the newspaper.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you think I read their fearful lies?\u201D he cried.\r\n\r\nThen he gave vent to the anger raging within him. \u201CDid ever anyone\r\nhear,\u201D he cried, \u201Cof masters making such fools of their people? For two\r\nwhole hours I\u2019ve been waiting for my pay! There were ten of us in the\r\noffice kicking our heels there. Then at last Monsieur Manoury arrived\r\nin a cab. Where he had come from I don\u2019t know, and don\u2019t care, but I\u2019m\r\nquite sure it wasn\u2019t any respectable place. Those salesmen are all a\r\nparcel of thieves and libertines! And then, too, the hog actually gave\r\nme all my money in small change!\u201D\r\n\r\nRobine expressed his sympathy with Logre by the slight movement of his\r\neyelids. But suddenly the hunchback bethought him of a victim upon whom\r\nto pour out his wrath. \u201CRose! Rose!\u201D he cried, stretching his head out\r\nof the little room.\r\n\r\nThe young woman quickly responded to the call, trembling all over.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D shouted Logre, \u201Cwhat do you stand staring at me like that for?\r\nMuch good that\u2019ll do! You saw me come in, didn\u2019t you? Why haven\u2019t you\r\nbrought me my glass of black coffee, then?\u201D\r\n\r\nGavard ordered two similar glasses, and Rose made all haste to bring\r\nwhat was required, while Logre glared sternly at the glasses and little\r\nsugar trays as if studying them. When he had taken a drink he seemed to\r\ngrow somewhat calmer.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut it\u2019s Charvet who must be getting bored,\u201D he said presently. \u201CHe is\r\nwaiting outside on the pavement for Clemence.\u201D\r\n\r\nCharvet, however, now made his appearance, followed by Clemence. He was\r\na tall, scraggy young man, carefully shaved, with a skinny nose and\r\nthin lips. He lived in the Rue Vavin, behind the Luxembourg, and called\r\nhimself a professor. In politics he was a disciple of H\u00E9bert.[*] He\r\nwore his hair very long, and the collar and lapels of his threadbare\r\nfrock-coat were broadly turned back. Affecting the manner and speech of\r\na member of the National Convention, he would pour out such a flood of\r\nbitter words and make such a haughty display of pedantic learning that\r\nhe generally crushed his adversaries. Gavard was afraid of him, though\r\nhe would not confess it; still, in Charvet\u2019s absence he would say that\r\nhe really went too far. Robine, for his part, expressed approval of\r\neverything with his eyes. Logre sometimes opposed Charvet on the\r\nquestion of salaries; but the other was really the autocrat of the\r\ncoterie, having the greatest fund of information and the most\r\noverbearing manner. For more than ten years he and Clemence had lived\r\ntogether as man and wife, in accordance with a previously arranged\r\ncontract, the terms of which were strictly observed by both parties to\r\nit. Florent looked at the young woman with some little surprise, but at\r\nlast he recollected where he had previously seen her. This was at the\r\nfish auction. She was, indeed, none other than the tall dark female\r\nclerk whom he had observed writing with outstretched fingers, after the\r\nmanner of one who had been carefully instructed in the art of holding a\r\npen.\r\n\r\n[*] H\u00E9bert, as the reader will remember, was the furious demagogue with\r\nthe foul tongue and poisoned pen who edited the _P\u00E8re Duchesne_ at the\r\ntime of the first French Revolution. We had a revival of his politics\r\nand his journal in Paris during the Commune of 1871.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nRose made her appearance at the heels of the two newcomers. Without\r\nsaying a word she placed a mug of beer before Charvet and a tray before\r\nClemence, who in a leisurely way began to compound a glass of \u201Cgrog,\u201D\r\npouring some hot water over a slice of lemon, which she crushed with\r\nher spoon, and glancing carefully at the decanter as she poured out\r\nsome rum, so as not to add more of it than a small liqueur glass could\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\nGavard now presented Florent to the company, but more especially to\r\nCharvet. He introduced them to one another as professors, and very able\r\nmen, who would be sure to get on well together. But it was probable\r\nthat he had already been guilty of some indiscretion, for all the men\r\nat once shook hands with a tight and somewhat masonic squeeze of each\r\nother\u2019s fingers. Charvet, for his part, showed himself almost amiable;\r\nand whether he and the others knew anything of Florent\u2019s antecedents,\r\nthey at all events indulged in no embarrassing allusions.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid Manoury pay you in small change?\u201D Logre asked Clemence.\r\n\r\nShe answered affirmatively, and produced a roll of francs and another\r\nof two-franc pieces, and unwrapped them. Charvet watched her, and his\r\neyes followed the rolls as she replaced them in her pocket, after\r\ncounting their contents and satisfying herself that they were correct.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe have our accounts to settle,\u201D he said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, we\u2019ll settle up to-night,\u201D the young woman replied. \u201CBut we are\r\nabout even, I should think. I\u2019ve breakfasted with you four times,\r\nhaven\u2019t I? But I lent you a hundred sous last week, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent, surprised at hearing this, discreetly turned his head away.\r\nThen Clemence slipped the last roll of silver into her pocket, drank a\r\nlittle of her grog, and, leaning against the glazed partition, quietly\r\nsettled herself down to listen to the men talking politics. Gavard had\r\ntaken up the newspaper again, and, in tones which he strove to render\r\ncomic, was reading out some passages of the speech from the throne\r\nwhich had been delivered that morning at the opening of the Chambers.\r\nCharvet made fine sport of the official phraseology; there was not a\r\nsingle line of it which he did not tear to pieces. One sentence\r\nafforded especial amusement to them all. It was this: \u201CWe are\r\nconfident, gentlemen, that, leaning on your lights[*] and the\r\nconservative sentiments of the country, we shall succeed in increasing\r\nthe national prosperity day by day.\u201D\r\n\r\n[*] In the sense of illumination of mind. It has been necessary to give\r\na literal translation of this phrase to enable the reader to realise\r\nthe point of subsequent witticisms in which Clemence and Gavard\r\nindulge. \u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nLogre rose up and repeated this sentence, and by speaking through his\r\nnose succeeded fairly well in mimicking the Emperor\u2019s drawling voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s lovely, that prosperity of his; why, everyone\u2019s dying of hunger!\u201D\r\nsaid Charvet.\r\n\r\n\u201CTrade is shocking,\u201D asserted Gavard.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what in the name of goodness is the meaning of anybody \u2018leaning on\r\nlights\u2019?\u201D continued Clemence, who prided herself upon literary culture.\r\n\r\nRobine himself even allowed a faint laugh to escape from the depths of\r\nhis beard. The discussion began to grow warm. The party fell foul of\r\nthe Corps L\u00E9gislatif, and spoke of it with great severity. Logre did\r\nnot cease ranting, and Florent found him the same as when he cried the\r\nfish at the auctions\u2014protruding his jaws and hurling his words forward\r\nwith a wave of the arm, whilst retaining the crouching attitude of a\r\nsnarling dog. Indeed, he talked politics in just the same furious\r\nmanner as he offered a tray full of soles for sale.\r\n\r\nCharvet, on the other hand, became quieter and colder amidst the smoke\r\nof the pipes and the fumes of the gas which were now filling the little\r\nden; and his voice assumed a dry incisive tone, sharp like a guillotine\r\nblade, while Robine gently wagged his head without once removing his\r\nchin from the ivory knob of his cane. However, some remark of Gavard\u2019s\r\nled the conversation to the subject of women.\r\n\r\n\u201CWoman,\u201D declared Charvet drily, \u201Cis the equal of man; and, that being\r\nso, she ought not to inconvenience him in the management of his life.\r\nMarriage is a partnership, in which everything should be halved. Isn\u2019t\r\nthat so, Clemence?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CClearly so,\u201D replied the young woman, leaning back with her head\r\nagainst the wall and gazing into the air.\r\n\r\nHowever, Florent now saw Lacaille, the costermonger, and Alexandre, the\r\nporter, Claude Lantier\u2019s friend, come into the little room. In the past\r\nthese two had long remained at the other table in the sanctum; they did\r\nnot belong to the same class as the others. By the help of politics,\r\nhowever, their chairs had drawn nearer, and they had ended by forming\r\npart of the circle. Charvet, in whose eyes they represented \u201Cthe\r\npeople,\u201D did his best to indoctrinate them with his advanced political\r\ntheories, while Gavard played the part of the shopkeeper free from all\r\nsocial prejudices by clinking glasses with them. Alexandre was a\r\ncheerful, good-humoured giant, with the manner of a big merry lad.\r\nLacaille, on the other hand, was embittered; his hair was already\r\ngrizzling; and, bent and wearied by his ceaseless perambulations\r\nthrough the streets of Paris, he would at times glance loweringly at\r\nthe placid figure of Robine, and his sound boots and heavy coat.\r\n\r\nThat evening both Lacaille and Alexandre called for a liqueur glass of\r\nbrandy, and then the conversation was renewed with increased warmth and\r\nexcitement, the party being now quite complete. A little later, while\r\nthe door of the cabinet was left ajar, Florent caught sight of\r\nMademoiselle Saget standing in front of the counter. She had taken a\r\nbottle from under her apron, and was watching Rose as the latter poured\r\ninto it a large measureful of black-currant syrup and a smaller one of\r\nbrandy. Then the bottle disappeared under the apron again, and\r\nMademoiselle Saget, with her hands out of sight, remained talking in\r\nthe bright glow of the counter, face to face with the big mirror, in\r\nwhich the flasks and bottles of liqueurs were reflected like rows of\r\nVenetian lanterns. In the evening all the metal and glass of the\r\nestablishment helped to illuminate it with wonderful brilliancy. The\r\nold maid, standing there in her black skirts, looked almost like some\r\nbig strange insect amidst all the crude brightness. Florent noticed\r\nthat she was trying to inveigle Rose into a conversation, and shrewdly\r\nsuspected that she had caught sight of him through the half open\r\ndoorway. Since he had been on duty at the markets he had met her at\r\nalmost every step, loitering in one or another of the covered ways, and\r\ngenerally in the company of Madame Lec\u0153ur and La Sarriette. He had\r\nnoticed also that the three women stealthily examined him, and seemed\r\nlost in amazement at seeing him installed in the position of inspector.\r\nThat evening, however, Rose was no doubt loath to enter into\r\nconversation with the old maid, for the latter at last turned round,\r\napparently with the intention of approaching Monsieur Lebigre, who was\r\nplaying piquet with a customer at one of the bronzed tables. Creeping\r\nquietly along, Mademoiselle Saget had at last managed to install\r\nherself beside the partition of the cabinet, when she was observed by\r\nGavard, who detested her.\r\n\r\n\u201CShut the door, Florent!\u201D he cried unceremoniously. \u201CWe can\u2019t even be\r\nby ourselves, it seems!\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen midnight came and Lacaille went away he exchanged a few whispered\r\nwords with Monsieur Lebigre, and as the latter shook hands with him he\r\nslipped four five-franc pieces into his palm, without anyone noticing\r\nit. \u201CThat\u2019ll make twenty-two francs that you\u2019ll have to pay to-morrow,\r\nremember,\u201D he whispered in his ear. \u201CThe person who lends the money\r\nwon\u2019t do it for less in future. Don\u2019t forget, too, that you owe three\r\ndays\u2019 truck hire. You must pay everything off.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Monsieur Lebigre wished the friends good night. He was very sleepy\r\nand should sleep well, he said, with a yawn which revealed his big\r\nteeth, while Rose gazed at him with an air of submissive humility.\r\nHowever, he gave her a push, and told her to go and turn out the gas in\r\nthe little room.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the pavement, Gavard stumbled and nearly fell. And being in\r\na humorous vein, he thereupon exclaimed: \u201CConfound it all! At any rate,\r\nI don\u2019t seem to be leaning on anybody\u2019s lights.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis remark seemed to amuse the others, and the party broke up. A\r\nlittle later Florent returned to Lebigre\u2019s, and indeed he became quite\r\nattached to the \u201Ccabinet,\u201D finding a seductive charm in Robine\u2019s\r\ncontemplative silence, Logre\u2019s fiery outbursts, and Charvet\u2019s cool\r\nvenom. When he went home, he did not at once retire to bed. He had\r\ngrown very fond of his attic, that girlish bedroom, where Augustine had\r\nleft scraps of ribbons, souvenirs, and other feminine trifles lying\r\nabout. There still remained some hair-pins on the mantelpiece, with\r\ngilt cardboard boxes of buttons and lozenges, cutout pictures, and\r\nempty pomade pots that retained an odour of jasmine. Then there were\r\nsome reels of thread, needles, and a missal lying by the side of a\r\nsoiled Dream-book in the drawer of the rickety deal table. A white\r\nsummer dress with yellow spots hung forgotten from a nail; while upon\r\nthe board which served as a toilet-table a big stain behind the\r\nwater-jug showed where a bottle of bandoline had been overturned. The\r\nlittle chamber, with its narrow iron bed, its two rush-bottomed chairs,\r\nand its faded grey wallpaper, was instinct with innocent simplicity.\r\nThe plain white curtains, the childishness suggested by the cardboard\r\nboxes and the Dream-book, and the clumsy coquetry which had stained the\r\nwalls, all charmed Florent and brought him back to dreams of youth. He\r\nwould have preferred not to have known that plain, wiry-haired\r\nAugustine, but to have been able to imagine that he was occupying the\r\nroom of a sister, some bright sweet girl of whose budding womanhood\r\nevery trifle around him spoke.\r\n\r\nYet another pleasure which he took was to lean out of the garret window\r\nat nighttime. In front of it was a narrow ledge of roof, enclosed by an\r\niron railing, and forming a sort of balcony, on which Augustine had\r\ngrown a pomegranate in a box. Since the nights had turned cold, Florent\r\nhad brought the pomegranate indoors and kept it by the foot of his bed\r\ntill morning. He would linger for a few minutes by the open window,\r\ninhaling deep draughts of the sharp fresh air which was wafted up from\r\nthe Seine, over the housetops of the Rue de Rivoli. Below him the roofs\r\nof the markets spread confusedly in a grey expanse, like slumbering\r\nlakes on whose surface the furtive reflection of a pane of glass\r\ngleamed every now and then like a silvery ripple. Farther away the\r\nroofs of the meat and poultry pavilions lay in deeper gloom, and became\r\nmere masses of shadow barring the horizon. Florent delighted in the\r\ngreat stretch of open sky in front of him, in that spreading expanse of\r\nthe markets which amidst all the narrow city streets brought him a dim\r\nvision of some strip of sea coast, of the still grey waters of a bay\r\nscarce quivering from the roll of the distant billows. He used to lose\r\nhimself in dreams as he stood there; each night he conjured up the\r\nvision of some fresh coast line. To return in mind to the eight years\r\nof despair which he had spent away from France rendered him both very\r\nsad and very happy. Then at last, shivering all over, he would close\r\nthe window. Often, as he stood in front of the fireplace taking off his\r\ncollar, the photograph of Auguste and Augustine would fill him with\r\ndisquietude. They seemed to be watching him as they stood there, hand\r\nin hand, smiling faintly.\r\n\r\nFlorent\u2019s first few weeks at the fish market were very painful to him.\r\nThe Mehudins treated him with open hostility, which infected the whole\r\nmarket with a spirit of opposition. The beautiful Norman intended to\r\nrevenge herself on the handsome Lisa, and the latter\u2019s cousin seemed a\r\nvictim ready to hand.\r\n\r\nThe Mehudins came from Rouen. Louise\u2019s mother still related how she had\r\nfirst arrived in Paris with a basket of eels. She had ever afterwards\r\nremained in the fish trade. She had married a man employed in the\r\nOctroi service, who had died leaving her with two little girls. It was\r\nshe who by her full figure and glowing freshness had won for herself in\r\nearlier days the nickname of \u201Cthe beautiful Norman,\u201D which her eldest\r\ndaughter had inherited. Now five and sixty years of age, Madame Mehudin\r\nhad become flabby and shapeless, and the damp air of the fish market\r\nhad rendered her voice rough and hoarse, and given a bluish tinge to\r\nher skin. Sedentary life had made her extremely bulky, and her head was\r\nthrown backwards by the exuberance of her bosom. She had never been\r\nwilling to renounce the fashions of her younger days, but still wore\r\nthe flowered gown, the yellow kerchief, and turban-like head-gear of\r\nthe classic fish-wife, besides retaining the latter\u2019s loud voice and\r\nrapidity of gesture as she stood with her hands on her hips, shouting\r\nout the whole abusive vocabulary of her calling.\r\n\r\nShe looked back regretfully to the old March\u00E9 des Innocents, which the\r\nnew central markets had supplanted. She would talk of the ancient\r\nrights of the market \u201Cladies,\u201D and mingle stories of fisticuffs\r\nexchanged with the police with reminiscences of the visits she had paid\r\nthe Court in the time of Charles X and Louis Philippe, dressed in silk,\r\nand carrying a bouquet of flowers in her hand. Old Mother Mehudin, as\r\nshe was now generally called, had for a long time been the\r\nbanner-bearer of the Sisterhood of the Virgin at St. Leu. She would\r\nrelate that in the processions in the church there she had worn a dress\r\nand cap of tulle trimmed with satin ribbons, whilst holding aloft in\r\nher puffy fingers the gilded staff of the richly-fringed silk standard\r\non which the figure of the Holy Mother was embroidered.\r\n\r\nAccording to the gossip of the neighbourhood, the old woman had made a\r\nfairly substantial fortune, though the only signs of it were the\r\nmassive gold ornaments with which she loaded her neck and arms and\r\nbosom on important occasions. Her two daughters got on badly together\r\nas they grew up. The younger one, Claire, an idle, fair-complexioned\r\ngirl, complained of the ill-treatment which she received from her\r\nsister Louise, protesting, in her languid voice, that she could never\r\nsubmit to be the other\u2019s servant. As they would certainly have ended by\r\ncoming to blows, their mother separated them. She gave her stall in the\r\nfish market to Louise, while Claire, whom the smell of the skate and\r\nthe herrings affected in the lungs, installed herself among the fresh\r\nwater fish. And from that time the old mother, although she pretended\r\nto have retired from business altogether, would flit from one stall to\r\nthe other, still interfering in the selling of the fish, and causing\r\nher daughters continual annoyance by the foul insolence with which she\r\nwould at times speak to customers.\r\n\r\nClaire was a fantastical creature, very gentle in her manner, and yet\r\ncontinually at loggerheads with others. People said that she invariably\r\nfollowed her own whimsical inclinations. In spite of her dreamy,\r\ngirlish face she was imbued with a nature of silent firmness, a spirit\r\nof independence which prompted her to live apart; she never took things\r\nas other people did, but would one day evince perfect fairness, and the\r\nnext day arrant injustice. She would sometimes throw the market into\r\nconfusion by suddenly increasing or lowering the prices at her stall,\r\nwithout anyone being able to guess her reason for doing so. She herself\r\nwould refuse to explain her motive. By the time she reached her\r\nthirtieth year, her delicate physique and fine skin, which the water of\r\nthe tanks seemed to keep continually fresh and soft, her small,\r\nfaintly-marked face and lissome limbs would probably become heavy,\r\ncoarse, and flabby, till she would look like some faded saint that had\r\nstepped from a stained-glass window into the degrading sphere of the\r\nmarkets. At twenty-two, however, Claire, in the midst of her carp and\r\neels, was, to use Claude Lantier\u2019s expression, a Murillo. A Murillo,\r\nthat is, whose hair was often in disorder, who wore heavy shoes and\r\nclumsily cut dresses, which left her without any figure. But she was\r\nfree from all coquetry, and she assumed an air of scornful contempt\r\nwhen Louise, displaying her bows and ribbons, chaffed her about her\r\nclumsily knotted neckerchiefs. Moreover, she was virtuous; it was said\r\nthat the son of a rich shopkeeper in the neighbourhood had gone abroad\r\nin despair at having failed to induce her to listen to his suit.\r\n\r\nLouise, the beautiful Norman, was of a different nature. She had been\r\nengaged to be married to a clerk in the corn market; but a sack of\r\nflour falling upon the young man had broken his back and killed him.\r\nNot very long afterwards Louise had given birth to a boy. In the\r\nMehudins\u2019 circle of acquaintance she was looked upon as a widow; and\r\nthe old fish-wife in conversation would occasionally refer to the time\r\nwhen her son-in-law was alive.\r\n\r\nThe Mehudins were a power in the markets. When Monsieur Verlaque had\r\nfinished instructing Florent in his new duties, he advised him to\r\nconciliate certain of the stall-holders, if he wished his life to be\r\nendurable; and he even carried his sympathy so far as to put him in\r\npossession of the little secrets of the office, such as the various\r\nlittle breaches of rule that it was necessary to wink at, and those at\r\nwhich he would have to feign stern displeasure; and also the\r\ncircumstances under which he might accept a small present. A market\r\ninspector is at once a constable and a magistrate; he has to maintain\r\nproper order and cleanliness, and settle in a conciliatory spirit all\r\ndisputes between buyers and sellers. Florent, who was of a weak\r\ndisposition put on an artificial sternness when he was obliged to\r\nexercise his authority, and generally over-acted his part. Moreover,\r\nhis gloomy, pariah-like face and bitterness of spirit, the result of\r\nlong suffering, were against him.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Norman\u2019s idea was to involve him in some quarrel or\r\nother. She had sworn that he would not keep his berth a fortnight.\r\n\u201CThat fat Lisa\u2019s much mistaken,\u201D said she one morning on meeting Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur, \u201Cif she thinks that she\u2019s going to put people over us. We don\u2019t\r\nwant such ugly wretches here. That sweetheart of hers is a perfect\r\nfright!\u201D\r\n\r\nAfter the auctions, when Florent commenced his round of inspection,\r\nstrolling slowly through the dripping alleys, he could plainly see the\r\nbeautiful Norman watching him with an impudent smile on her face. Her\r\nstall, which was in the second row on the left, near the fresh water\r\nfish department faced the Rue Rambuteau. She would turn round, however,\r\nand never take her eyes off her victim whilst making fun of him with\r\nher neighbours. And when he passed in front of her, slowly examining\r\nthe slabs, she feigned hilarious merriment, slapped her fish with her\r\nhand, and turned her jets of water on at full stream, flooding the\r\npathway. Nevertheless Florent remained perfectly calm.\r\n\r\nAt last, one morning as was bound to happen, war broke out. As Florent\r\nreached La Normande\u2019s stall that day an unbearable stench assailed his\r\nnostrils. On the marble slab, in addition to part of a magnificent\r\nsalmon, showing its soft roseate flesh, there lay some turbots of\r\ncreamy whiteness, a few conger-eels pierced with black pins to mark\r\ntheir divisions, several pairs of soles, and some bass and red\r\nmullet\u2014in fact, quite a display of fresh fish. But in the midst of it,\r\namongst all these fish whose eyes still gleamed and whose gills were of\r\na bright crimson, there lay a huge skate of a ruddy tinge, splotched\r\nwith dark stains\u2014superb, indeed, with all its strange colourings.\r\nUnfortunately, it was rotten; its tail was falling off and the ribs of\r\nits fins were breaking through the skin.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must throw that skate away,\u201D said Florent as he came up.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Norman broke into a slight laugh. Florent raised his eyes\r\nand saw her standing before him, with her back against the bronze lamp\r\npost which lighted the stalls in her division. She had mounted upon a\r\nbox to keep her feet out of the damp, and appeared very tall as he\r\nglanced at her. She looked also handsomer than usual, with her hair\r\narranged in little curls, her sly face slightly bent, her lips\r\ncompressed, and her hands showing somewhat too rosily against her big\r\nwhite apron. Florent had never before seen her decked with so much\r\njewellery. She had long pendants in her ears, a chain round her neck, a\r\nbrooch in her dress body, and quite a collection of rings on two\r\nfingers of her left hand and one of her right.\r\n\r\nAs she still continued to look slyly at Florent, without making any\r\nreply, the latter continued: \u201CDo you hear? You must remove that skate.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe had not yet noticed the presence of old Madame Mehudin, who sat all\r\nof a heap on a chair in a corner. She now got up, however, and, with\r\nher fists resting on the marble slap, insolently exclaimed: \u201CDear me!\r\nAnd why is she to throw her skate away? You won\u2019t pay her for it, I\u2019ll\r\nbet!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent immediately understood the position. The women at the other\r\nstalls began to titter, and he felt that he was surrounded by covert\r\nrebellion, which a word might cause to blaze forth. He therefore\r\nrestrained himself, and in person drew the refuse-pail from under the\r\nstall and dropped the skate into it. Old Madame Mehudin had already\r\nstuck her hands on her hips, while the beautiful Norman, who had not\r\nspoken a word, burst into another malicious laugh as Florent strode\r\nsternly away amidst a chorus of jeers, which he pretended not to hear.\r\n\r\nEach day now some new trick was played upon him, and he was obliged to\r\nwalk through the market alleys as warily as though he were in a hostile\r\ncountry. He was splashed with water from the sponges employed to\r\ncleanse the slabs; he stumbled and almost fell over slippery refuse\r\nintentionally spread in his way; and even the porters contrived to run\r\ntheir baskets against the nape of his neck. One day, moreover, when two\r\nof the fish-wives were quarrelling, and he hastened up to prevent them\r\ncoming to blows, he was obliged to duck in order to escape being\r\nslapped on either cheek by a shower of little dabs which passed over\r\nhis head. There was a general outburst of laughter on this occasion,\r\nand Florent always believed that the two fish-wives were in league with\r\nthe Mehudins. However, his old-time experiences as a teacher had\r\nendowed him with angelic patience, and he was able to maintain a\r\nmagisterial coolness of manner even when anger was hotly rising within\r\nhim, and his whole being quivered with a sense of humiliation. Still,\r\nthe young scamps of the Rue de l\u2019Estrapade had never manifested the\r\nsavagery of these fish-wives, the cruel tenacity of these huge females,\r\nwhose massive figures heaved and shook with a giant-like joy whenever\r\nhe fell into any trap. They stared him out of countenance with their\r\nred faces; and in the coarse tones of their voices and the impudent\r\ngesture of their hands he could read volumes of filthy abuse levelled\r\nat himself. Gavard would have been quite in his element amidst all\r\nthese petticoats, and would have freely cuffed them all round; but\r\nFlorent, who had always been afraid of women, gradually felt\r\noverwhelmed as by a sort of nightmare in which giant women, buxom\r\nbeyond all imagination, danced threateningly around him, shouting at\r\nhim in hoarse voices and brandishing bare arms, as massive as any\r\nprize-fighter\u2019s.\r\n\r\nAmongst this hoard of females, however, Florent had one friend. Claire\r\nunhesitatingly declared that the new inspector was a very good fellow.\r\nWhen he passed in front of her, pursued by the coarse abuse of the\r\nothers, she gave him a pleasant smile, sitting nonchalantly behind her\r\nstall, with unruly errant locks of pale hair straying over her neck and\r\nher brow, and the bodice of her dress pinned all askew. He also often\r\nsaw her dipping her hands into her tanks, transferring the fish from\r\none compartment to another, and amusing herself by turning on the brass\r\ntaps, shaped like little dolphins with open mouths, from which the\r\nwater poured in streamlets. Amidst the rustling sound of the water she\r\nhad some of the quivering grace of a girl who has just been bathing and\r\nhas hurriedly slipped on her clothes.\r\n\r\nOne morning she was particularly amiable. She called the inspector to\r\nher to show him a huge eel which had been the wonder of the market when\r\nexhibited at the auction. She opened the grating, which she had\r\npreviously closed over the basin in whose depths the eel seemed to be\r\nlying sound asleep.\r\n\r\n\u201CWait a moment,\u201D she said, \u201Cand I\u2019ll show it to you.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she gently slipped her bare arm into the water; it was not a very\r\nplump arm, and its veins showed softly blue beneath its satiny skin. As\r\nsoon as the eel felt her touch, it rapidly twisted round, and seemed to\r\nfill the narrow trough with its glistening greenish coils. And directly\r\nit had settled down to rest again Claire once more stirred it with her\r\nfingertips.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is an enormous creature,\u201D Florent felt bound to say. \u201CI have rarely\r\nseen such a fine one.\u201D\r\n\r\nClaire thereupon confessed to him that she had at first been frightened\r\nof eels; but now she had learned how to tighten her grip so that they\r\ncould not slip away. From another compartment she took a smaller one,\r\nwhich began to wriggle both with head and tail, as she held it about\r\nthe middle in her closed fist. This made her laugh. She let it go, then\r\nseized another and another, scouring the basin and stirring up the\r\nwhole heap of snaky-looking creatures with her slim fingers.\r\n\r\nAfterwards she began to speak of the slackness of trade. The hawkers on\r\nthe foot-pavement of the covered way did the regular saleswomen a great\r\ndeal of injury, she said. Meantime her bare arm, which she had not\r\nwiped, was glistening and dripping with water. Big drops trickled from\r\neach finger.\r\n\r\n\u201COh,\u201D she exclaimed suddenly, \u201CI must show you my carp, too!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe now removed another grating, and, using both hands, lifted out a\r\nlarge carp, which began to flap its tail and gasp. It was too big to be\r\nheld conveniently, so she sought another one. This was smaller, and she\r\ncould hold it with one hand, but the latter was forced slightly open by\r\nthe panting of the sides each time that the fish gasped. To amuse\r\nherself it occurred to Claire to pop the tip of her thumb into the\r\ncarp\u2019s mouth whilst it was dilated. \u201CIt won\u2019t bite,\u201D said she with her\r\ngentle laugh; \u201Cit\u2019s not spiteful. No more are the crawfishes; I\u2019m not\r\nthe least afraid of them.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe plunged her arm into the water again, and from a compartment full\r\nof a confused crawling mass brought up a crawfish that had caught her\r\nlittle finger in its claws. She gave the creature a shake, but it no\r\ndoubt gripped her too tightly, for she turned very red, and snapped off\r\nits claw with a quick, angry gesture, though still continuing to smile.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy the way,\u201D she continued quickly, to conceal her emotion, \u201CI\r\nwouldn\u2019t trust myself with a pike; he\u2019d cut off my fingers like a\r\nknife.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe thereupon showed him some big pike arranged in order of size upon\r\nclean scoured shelves, beside some bronze-hued tench and little heaps\r\nof gudgeon. Her hands were now quite slimy with handling the carp, and\r\nas she stood there in the dampness rising from the tanks, she held them\r\noutstretched over the dripping fish on the stall. She seemed enveloped\r\nby an odour of spawn, that heavy scent which rises from among the reeds\r\nand water-lilies when the fish, languid in the sunlight, discharge\r\ntheir eggs. Then she wiped her hands on her apron, still smiling the\r\nplacid smile of a girl who knew nothing of passion in that quivering\r\natmosphere of the frigid loves of the river.\r\n\r\nThe kindliness which Claire showed to Florent was but a slight\r\nconsolation to him. By stopping to talk to the girl he only drew upon\r\nhimself still coarser jeers from the other stallkeepers. Claire\r\nshrugged her shoulders, and said that her mother was an old jade, and\r\nher sister a worthless creature. The injustice of the market folk\r\ntowards the new inspector filled her with indignation. The war between\r\nthem, however, grew more bitter every day. Florent had serious thoughts\r\nof resigning his post; indeed, he would not have retained it for\r\nanother twenty-four hours if he had not been afraid that Lisa might\r\nimagine him to be a coward. He was frightened of what she might say and\r\nwhat she might think. She was naturally well aware of the contest which\r\nwas going on between the fish-wives and their inspector; for the whole\r\nechoing market resounded with it, and the entire neighbourhood\r\ndiscussed each fresh incident with endless comments.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, well,\u201D Lisa would often say in the evening, after dinner, \u201CI\u2019d\r\nsoon bring them to reason if I had anything to do with them! Why, they\r\nare a lot of dirty jades that I wouldn\u2019t touch with the tip of my\r\nfinger! That Normande is the lowest of the low! I\u2019d soon crush her,\r\nthat I would! You should really use your authority, Florent. You are\r\nwrong to behave as you do. Put your foot down, and they\u2019ll all come to\r\ntheir senses very quickly, you\u2019ll see.\u201D\r\n\r\nA terrible climax was presently reached. One morning the servant of\r\nMadame Taboureau, the baker, came to the market to buy a brill; and the\r\nbeautiful Norman, having noticed her lingering near her stall for\r\nseveral minutes, began to make overtures to her in a coaxing way: \u201CCome\r\nand see me; I\u2019ll suit you,\u201D she said. \u201CWould you like a pair of soles,\r\nor a fine turbot?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen as the servant at last came up, and sniffed at a brill with that\r\ndissatisfied pout which buyers assume in the hope of getting what they\r\nwant at a lower price, La Normande continued:\r\n\r\n\u201CJust feel the weight of that, now,\u201D and so saying she laid the brill,\r\nwrapped in a sheet of thick yellow paper, on the woman\u2019s open palm.\r\n\r\nThe servant, a mournful little woman from Auvergne, felt the weight of\r\nthe brill, and examined its gills, still pouting, and saying not a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd how much do you want for it?\u201D she asked presently, in a reluctant\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\u201CFifteen francs,\u201D replied La Normande.\r\n\r\nAt this the servant hastily laid the brill on the stall again, and\r\nseemed anxious to hurry away, but the other detained her. \u201CWait a\r\nmoment,\u201D said she. \u201CWhat do you offer?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, I can\u2019t take it. It is much too dear.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, now, make me an offer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, will you take eight francs?\u201D\r\n\r\nOld Madame Mehudin, who was there, suddenly seemed to wake up, and\r\nbroke out into a contemptuous laugh. Did people think that she and her\r\ndaughter stole the fish they sold? \u201CEight francs for a brill that\r\nsize!\u201D she exclaimed. \u201CYou\u2019ll be wanting one for nothing next, to use\r\nas a cooling plaster!\u201D\r\n\r\nMeantime La Normande turned her head away, as though greatly offended.\r\nHowever, the servant came back twice and offered nine francs; and\r\nfinally she increased her bid to ten.\r\n\r\n\u201CAll right, come on, give me your money!\u201D cried the fish-girl, seeing\r\nthat the woman was now really going away.\r\n\r\nThe servant took her stand in front of the stall and entered into a\r\nfriendly gossip with old Madame Mehudin. Madame Taboureau, she said,\r\nwas so exacting! She had got some people coming to dinner that evening,\r\nsome cousins from Blois a notary and his wife. Madame Taboureau\u2019s\r\nfamily, she added, was a very respectable one, and she herself,\r\nalthough only a baker, had received an excellent education.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll clean it nicely for me, won\u2019t you?\u201D added the woman, pausing in\r\nher chatter.\r\n\r\nWith a jerk of her finger La Normande had removed the fish\u2019s entrails\r\nand tossed them into a pail. Then she slipped a corner of her apron\r\nunder its gills to wipe away a few grains of sand. \u201CThere, my dear,\u201D\r\nshe said, putting the fish into the servant\u2019s basket, \u201Cyou\u2019ll come back\r\nto thank me.\u201D\r\n\r\nCertainly the servant did come back a quarter of an hour afterwards,\r\nbut it was with a flushed, red face. She had been crying, and her\r\nlittle body was trembling all over with anger. Tossing the brill on to\r\nthe marble slab, she pointed to a broad gash in its belly that reached\r\nthe bone. Then a flood of broken words burst from her throat, which was\r\nstill contracted by sobbing: \u201CMadame Taboureau won\u2019t have it. She says\r\nshe couldn\u2019t put it on her table. She told me, too, that I was an\r\nidiot, and let myself be cheated by anyone. You can see for yourself\r\nthat the fish is spoilt. I never thought of turning it round; I quite\r\ntrusted you. Give me my ten francs back.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou should look at what you buy,\u201D the handsome Norman calmly observed.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as the servant was just raising her voice again, old Madame\r\nMehudin got up. \u201CJust you shut up!\u201D she cried. \u201CWe\u2019re not going to take\r\nback a fish that\u2019s been knocking about in other people\u2019s houses. How do\r\nwe know that you didn\u2019t let it fall and damage it yourself?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI! I damage it!\u201D The little servant was choking with indignation. \u201CAh!\r\nyou\u2019re a couple of thieves!\u201D she cried, sobbing bitterly. \u201CYes, a\r\ncouple of thieves! Madame Taboureau herself told me so!\u201D\r\n\r\nMatters then became uproarious. Boiling over with rage and brandishing\r\ntheir fists, both mother and daughter fairly exploded; while the poor\r\nlittle servant, quite bewildered by their voices, the one hoarse and\r\nthe other shrill, which belaboured her with insults as though they were\r\nbattledores and she a shuttlecock, sobbed on more bitterly than ever.\r\n\r\n\u201CBe off with you! Your Madame Taboureau would like to be half as fresh\r\nas that fish is! She\u2019d like us to sew it up for her, no doubt!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA whole fish for ten francs! What\u2019ll she want next!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen came coarse words and foul accusations. Had the servant been the\r\nmost worthless of her sex she could not have been more bitterly\r\nupbraided.\r\n\r\nFlorent, whom the market keeper had gone to fetch, made his appearance\r\nwhen the quarrel was at its hottest. The whole pavilion seemed to be in\r\na state of insurrection. The fish-wives, who manifest the keenest\r\njealousy of each other when the sale of a penny herring is in question,\r\ndisplay a united front when a quarrel arises with a buyer. They sang\r\nthe popular old ditty, \u201CThe baker\u2019s wife has heaps of crowns, which\r\ncost her precious little\u201D; they stamped their feet, and goaded the\r\nMehudins as though the latter were dogs which they were urging on to\r\nbite and devour. And there were even some, having stalls at the other\r\nend of the alley, who rushed up wildly, as though they meant to spring\r\nat the chignon of the poor little woman, she meantime being quite\r\nsubmerged by the flood of insulting abuse poured upon her.\r\n\r\n\u201CReturn mademoiselle her ten francs,\u201D said Florent sternly, when he had\r\nlearned what had taken place.\r\n\r\nBut old Madame Mehudin had her blood up. \u201CAs for you, my little man,\u201D\r\nquoth she, \u201Cgo to blazes! Here, that\u2019s how I\u2019ll return the ten francs!\u201D\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, she flung the brill with all her force at the head of\r\nMadame Taboureau\u2019s servant, who received it full in the face. The blood\r\nspurted from her nose, and the brill, after adhering for a moment to\r\nher cheeks, fell to the ground and burst with a flop like that of a wet\r\nclout. This brutal act threw Florent into a fury. The beautiful Norman\r\nfelt frightened and recoiled, as he cried out: \u201CI suspend you for a\r\nweek, and I will have your licence withdrawn. You hear me?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as the other fish-wives were still jeering behind him, he turned\r\nround with such a threatening air that they quailed like wild beasts\r\nmastered by the tamer, and tried to assume an expression of innocence.\r\nWhen the Mehudins had returned the ten francs, Florent peremptorily\r\nordered them to cease selling at once. The old woman was choking with\r\nrage, while the daughter kept silent, but turned very white. She, the\r\nbeautiful Norman, to be driven out of her stall!\r\n\r\nClaire said in her quiet voice that it served her mother and sister\r\nright, a remark which nearly resulted in the two girls tearing each\r\nother\u2019s hair out that evening when they returned home to the Rue\r\nPirouette. However, when the Mehudins came back to the market at the\r\nweek\u2019s end, they remained very quiet, reserved, and curt of speech,\r\nthough full of a cold-blooded wrath. Moreover, they found the pavilion\r\nquite calm and restored to order again. From that day forward the\r\nbeautiful Norman must have harboured the thought of some terrible\r\nvengeance. She felt that she really had Lisa to thank for what had\r\nhappened. She had met her, the day after the battle, carrying her head\r\nso high, that she had sworn she would make her pay dearly for her\r\nglance of triumph. She held interminable confabulations with Madame\r\nSaget, Madame Lec\u0153ur, and La Sarriette, in quiet corners of the market;\r\nhowever, all their chatter about the shameless conduct which they\r\nslanderously ascribed to Lisa and her cousin, and about the hairs which\r\nthey declared were found in Quenu\u2019s chitterlings, brought La Normande\r\nlittle consolation. She was trying to think of some very malicious plan\r\nof vengeance, which would strike her rival to the heart.\r\n\r\nHer child was growing up in the fish market in all freedom and neglect.\r\nWhen but three years old the youngster had been brought there, and day\r\nby day remained squatting on some rag amidst the fish. He would fall\r\nasleep beside the big tunnies as though he were one of them, and awake\r\namong the mackerel and whiting. The little rascal smelt of fish as\r\nstrongly as though he were some big fish\u2019s offspring. For a long time\r\nhis favourite pastime, whenever his mother\u2019s back was turned, was to\r\nbuild walls and houses of herrings; and he would also play at soldiers\r\non the marble slab, arranging the red gurnets in confronting lines,\r\npushing them against each other, and battering their heads, while\r\nimitating the sound of drum and trumpet with his lips; after which he\r\nwould throw them all into a heap again, and exclaim that they were\r\ndead. When he grew older he would prowl about his aunt Claire\u2019s stall\r\nto get hold of the bladders of the carp and pike which she gutted. He\r\nplaced them on the ground and made them burst, an amusement which\r\nafforded him vast delight. When he was seven he rushed about the\r\nalleys, crawled under the stalls, ferreted amongst the zinc bound fish\r\nboxes, and became the spoiled pet of all the women. Whenever they\r\nshowed him something fresh which pleased him, he would clasp his hands\r\nand exclaim in ecstasy, \u201COh, isn\u2019t it stunning!\u201D _Muche_ was the exact\r\nword which he used; _muche_ being the equivalent of \u201Cstunning\u201D in the\r\nlingo of the markets; and he used the expression so often that it clung\r\nto him as a nickname. He became known all over the place as \u201CMuche.\u201D It\r\nwas Muche here, there and everywhere; no one called him anything else.\r\nHe was to be met with in every nook; in out-of-the-way corners of the\r\noffices in the auction pavilion; among the piles of oyster baskets, and\r\nbetwixt the buckets where the refuse was thrown. With a pinky fairness\r\nof skin, he was like a young barbel frisking and gliding about in deep\r\nwater. He was as fond of running, streaming water as any young fry. He\r\nwas ever dabbling in the pools in the alleys. He wetted himself with\r\nthe drippings from the tables, and when no one was looking often slyly\r\nturned on the taps, rejoicing in the bursting gush of water. But it was\r\nespecially beside the fountains near the cellar steps that his mother\r\nwent to seek him in the evening, and she would bring him thence with\r\nhis hands quite blue, and his shoes, and even his pockets, full of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAt seven years old Muche was as pretty as an angel, and as coarse in\r\nhis manners as any carter. He had curly chestnut hair, beautiful eyes,\r\nand an innocent-looking mouth which gave vent to language that even a\r\ngendarme would have hesitated to use. Brought up amidst all the\r\nribaldry and profanity of the markets, he had the whole vocabulary of\r\nthe place on the tip of his tongue. With his hands on his hips he often\r\nmimicked Grandmother Mehudin in her anger, and at these times the\r\ncoarsest and vilest expressions would stream from his lips in a voice\r\nof crystalline purity that might have belonged to some little chorister\r\nchanting the _Ave Maria_. He would even try to assume a hoarse\r\nroughness of tone, seek to degrade and taint that exquisite freshness\r\nof childhood which made him resemble a _bambino_ on the Madonna\u2019s\r\nknees. The fish-wives laughed at him till they cried; and he,\r\nencouraged, could scarcely say a couple of words without rapping out an\r\noath. But in spite of all this he still remained charming,\r\nunderstanding nothing of the dirt amidst which he lived, kept in\r\nvigorous health by the fresh breezes and sharp odours of the fish\r\nmarket, and reciting his vocabulary of coarse indecencies with as pure\r\na face as though he were saying his prayers.\r\n\r\nThe winter was approaching, and Muche seemed very sensitive to the\r\ncold. As soon as the chilly weather set in he manifested a strong\r\npredilection for the inspector\u2019s office. This was situated in the\r\nleft-hand corner of the pavilion, on the side of the Rue Rambuteau. The\r\nfurniture consisted of a table, a stack of drawers, an easy-chair, two\r\nother chairs, and a stove. It was this stove which attracted Muche.\r\nFlorent quite worshipped children, and when he saw the little fellow,\r\nwith his dripping legs, gazing wistfully through the window, he made\r\nhim come inside. His first conversation with the lad caused him\r\nprofound amazement. Muche sat down in front of the stove, and in his\r\nquiet voice exclaimed: \u201CI\u2019ll just toast my toes, do you see? It\u2019s d\u2014\u2014d\r\ncold this morning.\u201D Then he broke into a rippling laugh, and added:\r\n\u201CAunt Claire looks awfully blue this morning. Is it true, sir, that you\r\nare sweet on her?\u201D\r\n\r\nAmazed though he was, Florent felt quite interested in the odd little\r\nfellow. The handsome Norman retained her surly bearing, but allowed her\r\nson to frequent the inspector\u2019s office without a word of objection.\r\nFlorent consequently concluded that he had the mother\u2019s permission to\r\nreceive the boy, and every afternoon he asked him in; by degrees\r\nforming the idea of turning him into a steady, respectable young\r\nfellow. He could almost fancy that his brother Quenu had grown little\r\nagain, and that they were both in the big room in the Rue Royer-Collard\r\nonce more. The life which his self-sacrificing nature pictured to him\r\nas perfect happiness was a life spent with some young being who would\r\nnever grow up, whom he could go on teaching for ever, and in whose\r\ninnocence he might still love his fellow man. On the third day of his\r\nacquaintance with Muche he brought an alphabet to the office, and the\r\nlad delighted him by the intelligence he manifested. He learned his\r\nletters with all the sharp precocity which marks the Parisian street\r\narab, and derived great amusement from the woodcuts illustrating the\r\nalphabet.\r\n\r\nHe found opportunities, too, for plenty of fine fun in the little\r\noffice, where the stove still remained the chief attraction and a\r\nsource of endless enjoyment. At first he cooked potatoes and chestnuts\r\nat it, but presently these seemed insipid, and he thereupon stole some\r\ngudgeons from his aunt Claire, roasted them one by one, suspended from\r\na string in front of the glowing fire, and then devoured them with\r\ngusto, though he had no bread. One day he even brought a carp with him;\r\nbut it was impossible to roast it sufficiently, and it made such a\r\nsmell in the office that both window and door had to be thrown open.\r\nSometimes, when the odour of all these culinary operations became too\r\nstrong, Florent would throw the fish into the street, but as a rule he\r\nonly laughed. By the end of a couple of months Muche was able to read\r\nfairly well, and his copy-books did him credit.\r\n\r\nMeantime, every evening the lad wearied his mother with his talk about\r\nhis good friend Florent. His good friend Florent had drawn him pictures\r\nof trees and of men in huts, said he. His good friend Florent waved his\r\narm and said that men would be far better if they all knew how to read.\r\nAnd at last La Normande heard so much about Florent that she seemed to\r\nbe almost intimate with this man against whom she harboured so much\r\nrancour. One day she shut Muche up at home to prevent him from going to\r\nthe inspector\u2019s, but he cried so bitterly that she gave him his liberty\r\nagain on the following morning. There was very little determination\r\nabout her, in spite of her broad shoulders and bold looks. When the lad\r\ntold her how nice and warm he had been in the office, and came back to\r\nher with his clothes quite dry, she felt a sort of vague gratitude, a\r\npleasure in knowing that he had found a shelter-place where he could\r\nsit with his feet in front of a fire. Later on, she was quite touched\r\nwhen he read her some words from a scrap of soiled newspaper wrapped\r\nround a slice of conger-eel. By degrees, indeed, she began to think,\r\nthough without admitting it, that Florent could not really be a bad\r\nsort of fellow. She felt respect for his knowledge, mingled with an\r\nincreasing curiosity to see more of him and learn something of his\r\nlife. Then, all at once, she found an excuse for gratifying this\r\ninquisitiveness. She would use it as a means of vengeance. It would be\r\nfine fun to make friends with Florent and embroil him with that great\r\nfat Lisa.\r\n\r\n\u201CDoes your good friend Florent ever speak to you about me?\u201D she asked\r\nMuche one morning as she was dressing him.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, no,\u201D replied the boy. \u201CWe enjoy ourselves.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, you can tell him that I\u2019ve quite forgiven him, and that I\u2019m much\r\nobliged to him for having taught you to read.\u201D\r\n\r\nThenceforward the child was entrusted with some message every day. He\r\nwent backwards and forwards from his mother to the inspector, and from\r\nthe inspector to his mother, charged with kindly words and questions\r\nand answers, which he repeated mechanically without knowing their\r\nmeaning. He might, indeed, have been safely trusted with the most\r\ncompromising communications. However, the beautiful Norman felt afraid\r\nof appearing timid, and so one day she herself went to the inspector\u2019s\r\noffice and sat down on the second chair, while Muche was having his\r\nwriting lesson. She proved very suave and complimentary, and Florent\r\nwas by far the more embarrassed of the two. They only spoke of the lad;\r\nand when Florent expressed a fear that he might not be able to continue\r\nthe lessons in the office, La Normande invited him to come to their\r\nhome in the evening. She spoke also of payment; but at this he blushed,\r\nand said that he certainly would not come if any mention were made of\r\nmoney. Thereupon the young woman determined in her own mind that she\r\nwould recompense him with presents of choice fish.\r\n\r\nPeace was thus made between them; the beautiful Norman even took\r\nFlorent under her protection. Apart from this, however, the whole\r\nmarket was becoming reconciled to the new inspector, the fish-wives\r\narriving at the conclusion that he was really a better fellow than\r\nMonsieur Verlaque, notwithstanding his strange eyes. It was only old\r\nMadame Mehudin who still shrugged her shoulders, full of rancour as she\r\nwas against the \u201Clong lanky-guts,\u201D as she contemptuously called him.\r\nAnd then, too, a strange thing happened. One morning, when Florent\r\nstopped with a smile before Claire\u2019s tanks, the girl dropped an eel\r\nwhich she was holding and angrily turned her back upon him, her cheeks\r\nquite swollen and reddened by temper. The inspector was so much\r\nastonished that he spoke to La Normande about it.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, never mind her,\u201D said the young woman; \u201Cshe\u2019s cracked. She makes a\r\npoint of always differing from everybody else. She only behaved like\r\nthat to annoy me.\u201D\r\n\r\nLa Normande was now triumphant\u2014she strutted about her stall, and became\r\nmore coquettish than ever, arranging her hair in the most elaborate\r\nmanner. Meeting the handsome Lisa one day she returned her look of\r\nscorn, and even burst out laughing in her face. The certainty she felt\r\nof driving the mistress of the pork shop to despair by winning her\r\ncousin from her endowed her with a gay, sonorous laugh, which rolled up\r\nfrom her chest and rippled her white plump neck. She now had the whim\r\nof dressing Muche very showily in a little Highland costume and velvet\r\nbonnet. The lad had never previously worn anything but a tattered\r\nblouse. It unfortunately happened, however, that just about this time\r\nhe again became very fond of the water. The ice had melted and the\r\nweather was mild, so he gave his Scotch jacket a bath, turning the\r\nfountain tap on at full flow and letting the water pour down his arm\r\nfrom his elbow to his hand. He called this \u201Cplaying at gutters.\u201D Then a\r\nlittle later, when his mother came up and caught him, she found him\r\nwith two other young scamps watching a couple of little fishes swimming\r\nabout in his velvet cap, which he had filled with water.\r\n\r\nFor nearly eight months Florent lived in the markets, feeling continual\r\ndrowsiness. After his seven years of suffering he had lighted upon such\r\ncalm quietude, such unbroken regularity of life, that he was scarcely\r\nconscious of existing. He gave himself up to this jog-trot peacefulness\r\nwith a dazed sort of feeling, continually experiencing surprise at\r\nfinding himself each morning in the same armchair in the little office.\r\nThis office with its bare hut-like appearance had a charm for him. He\r\nhere found a quiet and secluded refuge amidst that ceaseless roar of\r\nthe markets which made him dream of some surging sea spreading around\r\nhim, and isolating him from the world. Gradually, however, a vague\r\nnervousness began to prey upon him; he became discontented, accused\r\nhimself of faults which he could not define, and began to rebel against\r\nthe emptiness which he experienced more and more acutely in mind and\r\nbody. Then, too, the evil smells of the fish market brought him nausea.\r\nBy degrees he became unhinged, his vague boredom developing into\r\nrestless, nervous excitement.\r\n\r\nAll his days were precisely alike, spent among the same sounds and the\r\nsame odours. In the mornings the noisy buzzing of the auction sales\r\nresounded in his ears like a distant echo of bells; and sometimes, when\r\nthere was a delay in the arrival of the fish, the auctions continued\r\ntill very late. Upon these occasions he remained in the pavilion till\r\nnoon, disturbed at every moment by quarrels and disputes, which he\r\nendeavoured to settle with scrupulous justice. Hours elapsed before he\r\ncould get free of some miserable matter or other which was exciting the\r\nmarket. He paced up and down amidst the crush and uproar of the sales,\r\nslowly perambulating the alleys and occasionally stopping in front of\r\nthe stalls which fringed the Rue Rambuteau, and where lay rosy heaps of\r\nprawns and baskets of boiled lobsters with tails tied backwards, while\r\nlive ones were gradually dying as they sprawled over the marble slabs.\r\nAnd then he would watch gentlemen in silk hats and black gloves\r\nbargaining with the fish-wives, and finally going off with boiled\r\nlobsters wrapped in paper in the pockets of their frock-coats.[*]\r\nFarther away, at the temporary stalls, where the commoner sorts of fish\r\nwere sold, he would recognise the bareheaded women of the\r\nneighbourhood, who always came at the same hour to make their\r\npurchases.\r\n\r\n[*] The little fish-basket for the use of customers, so familiar in\r\nLondon, is not known in Paris.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt times he took an interest in some well-dressed lady trailing her\r\nlace petticoats over the damp stones, and escorted by a servant in a\r\nwhite apron; and he would follow her at a little distance on noticing\r\nhow the fish-wives shrugged their shoulders at sight of her air of\r\ndisgust. The medley of hampers and baskets and bags, the crowd of\r\nskirts flitting along the damp alleys, occupied his attention until\r\nlunchtime. He took a delight in the dripping water and the fresh breeze\r\nas he passed from the acrid smell of the shell-fish to the pungent\r\nodour of the salted fish. It was always with the latter that he brought\r\nhis official round of inspection to a close. The cases of red herrings,\r\nthe Nantes sardines on their layers of leaves, and the rolled cod,\r\nexposed for sale under the eyes of stout, faded fish-wives, brought him\r\nthoughts of a voyage necessitating a vast supply of salted provisions.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the markets became quieter, grew drowsy; and Florent\r\nthen shut himself up in his office, made out his reports, and enjoyed\r\nthe happiest hours of his day. If he happened to go out and cross the\r\nfish market, he found it almost deserted. There was no longer the\r\ncrushing and pushing and uproar of ten o\u2019clock in the morning. The\r\nfish-wives, seated behind their stalls, leant back knitting, while a\r\nfew belated purchasers prowled about casting sidelong glances at the\r\nremaining fish, with the thoughtful eyes and compressed lips of women\r\nclosely calculating the price of their dinner. At last the twilight\r\nfell, there was a noise of boxes being moved, and the fish was laid for\r\nthe night on beds of ice; and then, after witnessing the closing of the\r\ngates, Florent went off, seemingly carrying the fish market along with\r\nhim in his clothes and his beard and his hair.\r\n\r\nFor the first few months this penetrating odour caused him no great\r\ndiscomfort. The winter was a severe one, the frosts converted the\r\nalleys into slippery mirrors, and the fountains and marble slabs were\r\nfringed with a lacework of ice. In the mornings it was necessary to\r\nplace little braziers underneath the taps before a drop of water could\r\nbe drawn. The frozen fish had twisted tails; and, dull of hue and hard\r\nto the touch like unpolished metal, gave out a ringing sound akin to\r\nthat of pale cast-iron when it snaps. Until February the pavilion\r\npresented a most mournful appearance: it was deserted, and wrapped in a\r\nbristling shroud of ice. But with March came a thaw, with mild weather\r\nand fogs and rain. Then the fish became soft again, and unpleasant\r\nodours mingled with the smell of mud wafted from the neighbouring\r\nstreets. These odours were as yet vague, tempered by the moisture which\r\nclung to the ground. But in the blazing June afternoons a reeking\r\nstench arose, and the atmosphere became heavy with a pestilential haze.\r\nThe upper windows were then opened, and huge blinds of grey canvas were\r\ndrawn beneath the burning sky. Nevertheless, a fiery rain seemed to be\r\npouring down, heating the market as though it were a big stove, and\r\nthere was not a breath of air to waft away the noxious emanations from\r\nthe fish. A visible steam went up from the stalls.\r\n\r\nThe masses of food amongst which Florent lived now began to cause him\r\nthe greatest discomfort. The disgust with which the pork shop had\r\nfilled him came back in a still more intolerable fashion. He almost\r\nsickened as he passed these masses of fish, which, despite all the\r\nwater lavished upon them, turned bad under a sudden whiff of hot air.\r\nEven when he shut himself up in his office his discomfort continued,\r\nfor the abominable odour forced its way through the chinks in the\r\nwoodwork of the window and door. When the sky was grey and leaden, the\r\nlittle room remained quite dark; and then the day was like a long\r\ntwilight in the depths of some fetid march. He was often attacked by\r\nfits of nervous excitement, and felt a craving desire to walk; and he\r\nwould then descend into the cellars by the broad staircase opening in\r\nthe middle of the pavilion. In the pent-up air down below, in the dim\r\nlight of the occasional gas jets, he once more found the refreshing\r\ncoolness diffused by pure cold water. He would stand in front of the\r\nbig tank where the reserve stock of live fish was kept, and listen to\r\nthe ceaseless murmur of the four streamlets of water falling from the\r\nfour corners of the central urn, and then spreading into a broad stream\r\nand gliding beneath the locked gratings of the basins with a gentle and\r\ncontinuous flow. This subterranean spring, this stream murmuring in the\r\ngloom, had a tranquillising effect upon him. Of an evening, too, he\r\ndelighted in the fine sunsets which threw the delicate lacework of the\r\nmarket buildings blackly against the red glow of the heavens. The\r\ndancing dust of the last sun rays streamed through every opening,\r\nthrough every chink of the Venetian shutters, and the whole was like\r\nsome luminous transparency on which the slender shafts of the columns,\r\nthe elegant curves of the girders, and the geometrical tracery of the\r\nroofs were minutely outlined. Florent feasted his eyes on this mighty\r\ndiagram washed in with Indian ink on phosphorescent vellum, and his\r\nmind reverted to his old fancy of a colossal machine with wheels and\r\nlevers and beams espied in the crimson glow of the fires blazing\r\nbeneath its boilers. At each consecutive hour of the day the changing\r\nplay of the light\u2014from the bluish haze of early morning and the black\r\nshadows of noon to the flaring of the sinking sun and the paling of its\r\nfires in the ashy grey of the twilight\u2014revealed the markets under a new\r\naspect; but on the flaming evenings, when the foul smells arose and\r\nforced their way across the broad yellow beams like hot puffs of steam,\r\nFlorent again experienced discomfort, and his dream changed, and he\r\nimagined himself in some gigantic knacker\u2019s boiling-house where the fat\r\nof a whole people was being melted down.\r\n\r\nThe coarseness of the market people, whose words and gestures seemed to\r\nbe infected with the evil smell of the place, also made him suffer. He\r\nwas very tolerant, and showed no mock modesty; still, these impudent\r\nwomen often embarrassed him. Madame Francois, whom he had again met,\r\nwas the only one with whom he felt at ease. She showed such pleasure on\r\nlearning he had found a berth and was quite comfortable and out of\r\nworry, as she put it, that he was quite touched. The laughter of Lisa,\r\nthe handsome Norman, and the others disquieted him; but of Madame\r\nFrancois he would willingly have made a confidante. She never laughed\r\nmockingly at him; when she did laugh, it was like a woman rejoicing at\r\nanother\u2019s happiness. She was a brave, plucky creature, too; hers was a\r\nhard business in winter, during the frosts, and the rainy weather was\r\nstill more trying. On some mornings Florent saw her arrive in a pouring\r\ndeluge which had been slowly, coldly falling ever since the previous\r\nnight. Between Nanterre and Paris the wheels of her cart had sunk up to\r\nthe axles in mud, and Balthazar was caked with mire to his belly. His\r\nmistress would pity him and sympathise with him as she wiped him down\r\nwith some old aprons.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe poor creatures are very sensitive,\u201D said she; \u201Ca mere nothing\r\ngives them a cold. Ah, my poor old Balthazar! I really thought that we\r\nhad tumbled into the Seine as we crossed the Neuilly bridge, the rain\r\ncame down in such a deluge!\u201D\r\n\r\nWhile Balthazar was housed in the inn stable his mistress remained in\r\nthe pouring rain to sell her vegetables. The footway was transformed\r\ninto a lake of liquid mud. The cabbages, carrots, and turnips were\r\npelted by the grey water, quite drowned by the muddy torrent that\r\nrushed along the pavement. There was no longer any of that glorious\r\ngreenery so apparent on bright mornings. The market gardeners, cowering\r\nin their heavy cloaks beneath the downpour, swore at the municipality\r\nwhich, after due inquiry, had declared that rain was in no way\r\ninjurious to vegetables, and that there was accordingly no necessity to\r\nerect any shelters.\r\n\r\nThose rainy mornings greatly worried Florent, who thought about Madame\r\nFrancois. He always managed to slip away and get a word with her. But\r\nhe never found her at all low-spirited. She shook herself like a\r\npoodle, saying that she was quite used to such weather, and was not\r\nmade of sugar, to melt away beneath a few drops of rain. However, he\r\nmade her seek refuge for a few minutes in one of the covered ways, and\r\nfrequently even took her to Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, where they had some hot\r\nwine together. While she with her peaceful face beamed on him in all\r\nfriendliness, he felt quite delighted with the healthy odour of the\r\nfields which she brought into the midst of the foul market atmosphere.\r\nShe exhaled a scent of earth, hay, fresh air, and open skies.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must come to Nanterre, my lad,\u201D she said to him, \u201Cand look at my\r\nkitchen garden. I have put borders of thyme everywhere. How bad your\r\nvillainous Paris does smell!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she went off, dripping. Florent, on his side, felt quite\r\nre-invigorated when he parted from her. He tried, too the effect of\r\nwork upon the nervous depression from which he suffered. He was a man\r\nof a very methodical temperament, and sometimes carried out his plans\r\nfor the allotment of his time with a strictness that bordered on mania.\r\nHe shut himself up two evenings a week in order to write an exhaustive\r\nwork on Cayenne. His modest bedroom was excellently adapted, he\r\nthought, to calm his mind and incline him to work. He lighted his fire,\r\nsaw that the pomegranate at the foot of the bed was looking all right,\r\nand then seated himself at the little table, and remained working till\r\nmidnight. He had pushed the missal and Dream-book back in the drawer,\r\nwhich was now filling with notes, memoranda, manuscripts of all kinds.\r\nThe work on Cayenne made but slow progress, however, as it was\r\nconstantly being interrupted by other projects, plans for enormous\r\nundertakings which he sketched out in a few words. He successively\r\ndrafted an outline of a complete reform of the administrative system of\r\nthe markets, a scheme for transforming the city dues, levied on produce\r\nas it entered Paris, into taxes levied upon the sales, a new system of\r\nvictualling the poorer neighbourhoods, and, lastly, a somewhat vague\r\nsocialist enactment for the storing in common warehouses of all the\r\nprovisions brought to the markets, and the ensuring of a minimum daily\r\nsupply to each household in Paris. As he sat there, with his head bent\r\nover his table, and his mind absorbed in thoughts of all these weighty\r\nmatters, his gloomy figure cast a great black shadow on the soft\r\npeacefulness of the garret. Sometimes a chaffinch which he had picked\r\nup one snowy day in the market would mistake the lamplight for the day,\r\nand break the silence, which only the scratching of Florent\u2019s pen on\r\nhis paper disturbed, by a cry.\r\n\r\nFlorent was fated to revert to politics. He had suffered too much\r\nthrough them not to make them the dearest occupation of his life. Under\r\nother conditions he might have become a good provincial schoolmaster,\r\nhappy in the peaceful life of some little town. But he had been treated\r\nas though he were a wolf, and felt as though he had been marked out by\r\nexile for some great combative task. His nervous discomfort was the\r\noutcome of his long reveries at Cayenne, the brooding bitterness he had\r\nfelt at his unmerited sufferings, and the vows he had secretly sworn to\r\navenge humanity and justice\u2014the former scourged with a whip, and the\r\nlatter trodden under foot. Those colossal markets and their teeming\r\nodoriferous masses of food had hastened the crisis. To Florent they\r\nappeared symbolical of some glutted, digesting beast, of Paris,\r\nwallowing in its fat and silently upholding the Empire. He seemed to be\r\nencircled by swelling forms and sleek, fat faces, which ever and ever\r\nprotested against his own martyrlike scragginess and sallow,\r\ndiscontented visage. To him the markets were like the stomach of the\r\nshopkeeping classes, the stomach of all the folks of average rectitude\r\npuffing itself out, rejoicing, glistening in the sunshine, and\r\ndeclaring that everything was for the best, since peaceable people had\r\nnever before grown so beautifully fat. As these thoughts passed through\r\nhis mind Florent clenched his fists, and felt ready for a struggle,\r\nmore irritated now by the thought of his exile than he had been when he\r\nfirst returned to France. Hatred resumed entire possession of him. He\r\noften let his pen drop and became absorbed in dreams. The dying fire\r\ncast a bright glow upon his face; the lamp burned smokily, and the\r\nchaffinch fell asleep again on one leg, with its head tucked under its\r\nwing.\r\n\r\nSometimes Auguste, on coming upstairs at eleven o\u2019clock and seeing the\r\nlight shining under the door, would knock, before going to bed. Florent\r\nadmitted him with some impatience. The assistant sat down in front of\r\nthe fire, speaking but little, and never saying why he had come. His\r\neyes would all the time remain fixed upon the photograph of himself and\r\nAugustine in their Sunday finery. Florent came to the conclusion that\r\nthe young man took a pleasure in visiting the room for the simple\r\nreason that it had been occupied by his sweetheart; and one evening he\r\nasked him with a smile if he had guessed rightly.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, perhaps it is so,\u201D replied Auguste, very much surprised at the\r\ndiscovery which he himself now made of the reasons which actuated him.\r\n\u201CI\u2019d really never thought of that before. I came to see you without\r\nknowing why. But if I were to tell Augustine, how she\u2019d laugh!\u201D\r\n\r\nWhenever he showed himself at all loquacious, his one eternal theme was\r\nthe pork shop which he was going to set up with Augustine at Plaisance.\r\nHe seemed so perfectly assured of arranging his life in accordance with\r\nhis desires, that Florent grew to feel a sort of respect for him,\r\nmingled with irritation. After all, the young fellow was very resolute\r\nand energetic, in spite of his seeming stupidity. He made straight for\r\nthe goal he had in view, and would doubtless reach it in perfect\r\nassurance and happiness. On the evenings of these visits from the\r\napprentice, Florent could not settle down to work again; he went off to\r\nbed in a discontented mood, and did not recover his equilibrium till\r\nthe thought passed through his mind, \u201CWhy, that Auguste is a perfect\r\nanimal!\u201D\r\n\r\nEvery month he went to Clamart to see Monsieur Verlaque. These visits\r\nwere almost a delight to him. The poor man still lingered on, to the\r\ngreat astonishment of Gavard, who had not expected him to last for more\r\nthan six months. Every time that Florent went to see him Verlaque would\r\ndeclare that he was feeling better, and was most anxious to resume his\r\nwork again. But the days glided by, and he had serious relapses.\r\nFlorent would sit by his bedside, chat about the fish market, and do\r\nwhat he could to enliven him. He deposited on the pedestal table the\r\nfifty francs which he surrendered to him each month; and the old\r\ninspector, though the payment had been agreed upon, invariably\r\nprotested, and seemed disinclined to take the money. Then they would\r\nbegin to speak of something else, and the coins remained lying on the\r\ntable. When Florent went away, Madame Verlaque always accompanied him\r\nto the street door. She was a gentle little woman, of a very tearful\r\ndisposition. Her one topic of conversation was the expense necessitated\r\nby her husband\u2019s illness, the costliness of chicken broth, butcher\u2019s\r\nmeat, Bordeaux wine, medicine, and doctors\u2019 fees. Her doleful\r\nconversation greatly embarrassed Florent, and on the first few\r\noccasions he did not understand the drift of it. But at last, as the\r\npoor woman seemed always in a state of tears, and kept saying how happy\r\nand comfortable they had been when they had enjoyed the full salary of\r\neighteen hundred francs a year, he timidly offered to make her a\r\nprivate allowance, to be kept secret from her husband. This offer,\r\nhowever, she declined, inconsistently declaring that the fifty francs\r\nwere sufficient. But in the course of the month she frequently wrote to\r\nFlorent, calling him their saviour. Her handwriting was small and fine,\r\nyet she would contrive to fill three pages of letter paper with humble,\r\nflowing sentences entreating the loan of ten francs; and this she at\r\nlast did so regularly that wellnigh the whole of Florent\u2019s hundred and\r\nfifty francs found its way to the Verlaques. The husband was probably\r\nunaware of it; however, the wife gratefully kissed Florent\u2019s hands.\r\nThis charity afforded him the greatest pleasure, and he concealed it as\r\nthough it were some forbidden selfish indulgence.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat rascal Verlaque is making a fool of you,\u201D Gavard would sometimes\r\nsay. \u201CHe\u2019s coddling himself up finely now that you are doing the work\r\nand paying him an income.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt last one day Florent replied:\r\n\r\n\u201COh, we\u2019ve arranged matters together. I\u2019m only to give him twenty-five\r\nfrancs a month in future.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Florent had but little need of money. The Quenus\r\ncontinued to provide him with board and lodging; and the few francs\r\nwhich he kept by him sufficed to pay for the refreshment he took in the\r\nevening at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s. His life had gradually assumed all the\r\nregularity of clockwork. He worked in his bedroom, continued to teach\r\nlittle Muche twice a week from eight to nine o\u2019clock, devoted an\r\nevening to Lisa, to avoid offending her, and spent the rest of his\r\nspare time in the little \u201Ccabinet\u201D with Gavard and his friends.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to the Mehudins\u2019 there was a touch of tutorial stiffness\r\nin his gentle demeanour. He was pleased with the old house in the Rue\r\nPirouette. On the ground floor he passed through the faint odours\r\npervading the premises of the purveyor of cooked vegetables. Big pans\r\nof boiled spinach and sorrel stood cooling in the little backyard. Then\r\nhe ascended the winding staircase, greasy and dark, with worn and\r\nbulging steps which sloped in a disquieting manner. The Mehudins\r\noccupied the whole of the second floor. Even when they had attained to\r\ncomfortable circumstances the old mother had always declined to move\r\ninto fresh quarters, despite all the supplications of her daughters,\r\nwho dreamt of living in a new house in a fine broad street. But on this\r\npoint the old woman was not to be moved; she had lived there, she said,\r\nand meant to die there. She contented herself, moreover, with a dark\r\nlittle closet, leaving the largest rooms to Claire and La Normande. The\r\nlater, with the authority of the elder born, had taken possession of\r\nthe room that overlooked the street; it was the best and largest of the\r\nsuite. Claire was so much annoyed at her sister\u2019s action in the matter\r\nthat she refused to occupy the adjoining room, whose window overlooked\r\nthe yard, and obstinately insisted on sleeping on the other side of the\r\nlanding, in a sort of garret, which she did not even have whitewashed.\r\nHowever, she had her own key, and so was independent; directly anything\r\nhappened to displease her she locked herself up in her own quarters.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, when Florent arrived the Mehudins were just finishing their\r\ndinner. Muche sprang to his neck, and for a moment the young man\r\nremained seated with the lad chattering between his legs. Then, when\r\nthe oilcloth cover had been wiped, the lesson began on a corner of the\r\ntable. The beautiful Norman gave Florent a cordial welcome. She\r\ngenerally began to knit or mend some linen, and would draw her chair up\r\nto the table and work by the light of the same lamp as the others; and\r\nshe frequently put down her needle to listen to the lesson, which\r\nfilled her with surprise. She soon began to feel warm esteem for this\r\nman who seemed so clever, who, in speaking to the little one, showed\r\nhimself as gentle as a woman, and manifested angelic patience in again\r\nand again repeating the same instructions. She no longer considered him\r\nat all plain, but even felt somewhat jealous of beautiful Lisa. And\r\nthen she drew her chair still nearer, and gazed at Florent with an\r\nembarrassing smile.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you are jogging my elbow, mother, and I can\u2019t write,\u201D Muche\r\nexclaimed angrily. \u201CThere! see what a blot you\u2019ve made me make! Get\r\nfurther away, do!\u201D\r\n\r\nLa Normande now gradually began to say a good many unpleasant things\r\nabout beautiful Lisa. She pretended that the latter concealed her real\r\nage, that she laced her stays so tightly that she nearly suffocated\r\nherself, and that if she came down of a morning looking so trim and\r\nneat, without a single hair out of place, it must be because she looked\r\nperfectly hideous when in dishabille. Then La Normande would raise her\r\narm a little, and say that there was no need for her to wear any stays\r\nto cramp and deform her figure. At these times the lessons would be\r\ninterrupted, and Muche gazed with interest at his mother as she raised\r\nher arms. Florent listened to her, and even laughed, thinking to\r\nhimself that women were very odd creatures. The rivalry between the\r\nbeautiful Norman and beautiful Lisa amused him.\r\n\r\nMuche, however, managed to finish his page of writing. Florent, who was\r\na good penman, set him copies in large hand and round hand on slips of\r\npaper. The words he chose were very long and took up the whole line,\r\nand he evinced a marked partiality for such expressions as\r\n\u201Ctyrannically,\u201D \u201Cliberticide,\u201D \u201Cunconstitutional,\u201D and \u201Crevolutionary.\u201D\r\nAt times also he made the boy copy such sentences as these: \u201CThe day of\r\njustice will surely come\u201D; \u201CThe suffering of the just man is the\r\ncondemnation of the oppressor\u201D; \u201CWhen the hour strikes, the guilty\r\nshall fall.\u201D In preparing these copy slips he was, indeed, influenced\r\nby the ideas which haunted his brain; he would for the time become\r\nquite oblivious of Muche, the beautiful Norman, and all his\r\nsurroundings. The lad would have copied Rousseau\u2019s \u201CContrat Social\u201D had\r\nhe been told to do so; and thus, drawing each letter in turn, he filled\r\npage after page with lines of \u201Ctyrannically\u201D and \u201Cunconstitutional.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs long as the tutor remained there, old Madame Mehudin kept fidgeting\r\nround the table, muttering to herself. She still harboured terrible\r\nrancour against Florent; and asserted that it was folly to make the lad\r\nwork in that way at a time when children should be in bed. She would\r\ncertainly have turned that \u201Cspindle-shanks\u201D out of the house, if the\r\nbeautiful Norman, after a stormy scene, had not bluntly told her that\r\nshe would go to live elsewhere if she were not allowed to receive whom\r\nshe chose. However, the pair began quarrelling again on the subject\r\nevery evening.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou may say what you like,\u201D exclaimed the old woman; \u201Cbut he\u2019s got\r\ntreacherous eyes. And, besides, I\u2019m always suspicious of those skinny\r\npeople. A skinny man\u2019s capable of anything. I\u2019ve never come across a\r\ndecent one yet. That one\u2019s as flat as a board. And he\u2019s got such an\r\nugly face, too! Though I\u2019m sixty-five and more, I\u2019d precious soon send\r\nhim about his business if he came a-courting of me!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe said this because she had a shrewd idea of how matters were likely\r\nto turn out. And then she went on to speak in laudatory terms of\r\nMonsieur Lebigre, who, indeed, paid the greatest attention to the\r\nbeautiful Norman. Apart from the handsome dowry which he imagined she\r\nwould bring with her, he considered that she would be a magnificent\r\nacquisition to his counter. The old woman never missed an opportunity\r\nto sound his praises; there was no lankiness, at any rate, about him,\r\nsaid she; he was stout and strong, with a pair of calves which would\r\nhave done honour even to one of the Emperor\u2019s footmen.\r\n\r\nHowever, La Normande shrugged her shoulders and snappishly replied:\r\n\u201CWhat do I care whether he\u2019s stout or not? I don\u2019t want him or anybody.\r\nAnd besides, I shall do as I please.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, if the old woman became too pointed in her remarks, the other\r\nadded: \u201CIt\u2019s no business of yours, and besides, it isn\u2019t true. Hold\r\nyour tongue and don\u2019t worry me.\u201D And thereupon she would go off into\r\nher room, banging the door behind her. Florent, however, had a yet more\r\nbitter enemy than Madame Mehudin in the house. As soon as ever he\r\narrived there, Claire would get up without a word, take a candle, and\r\ngo off to her own room on the other side of the landing; and she could\r\nbe heard locking her door in a burst of sullen anger. One evening when\r\nher sister asked the tutor to dinner, she prepared her own food on the\r\nlanding, and ate it in her bedroom; and now and again she secluded\r\nherself so closely that nothing was seen of her for a week at a time.\r\nShe usually retained her appearance of soft lissomness, but\r\nperiodically had a fit of iron rigidity, when her eyes blazed from\r\nunder her pale tawny locks like those of a distrustful wild animal. Old\r\nMother Mehudin, fancying that she might relieve herself in her company,\r\nonly made her furious by speaking to her of Florent; and thereupon the\r\nold woman, in her exasperation, told everyone that she would have gone\r\noff and left her daughters to themselves had she not been afraid of\r\ntheir devouring each other if they remained alone together.\r\n\r\nAs Florent went away one evening, he passed in front of Claire\u2019s door,\r\nwhich was standing wide open. He saw the girl look at him, and turn\r\nvery red. Her hostile demeanour annoyed him; and it was only the\r\ntimidity which he felt in the presence of women that restrained him\r\nfrom seeking an explanation of her conduct. On this particular evening\r\nhe would certainly have addressed her if he had not detected\r\nMademoiselle Saget\u2019s pale face peering over the balustrade of the upper\r\nlanding. So he went his way, but had not taken a dozen steps before\r\nClaire\u2019s door was closed behind him with such violence as to shake the\r\nwhole staircase. It was after this that Mademoiselle Saget, eager to\r\npropagate slander, went about repeating everywhere that Madame Quenu\u2019s\r\ncousin was \u201Ccarrying on\u201D most dreadfully with both the Mehudin girls.\r\n\r\nFlorent, however, gave very little thought to these two handsome young\r\nwomen. His usual manner towards them was that of a man who has but\r\nlittle success with the sex. Certainly he had come to entertain a\r\nfeeling of genuine friendship for La Normande, who really displayed a\r\nvery good heart when her impetuous temper did not run away with her.\r\nBut he never went any further than this. Moreover, the queenly\r\nproportions of her robust figure filled him with a kind of alarm; and\r\nof an evening, whenever she drew her chair up to the lamp and bent\r\nforward as though to look at Muche\u2019s copy-book, he drew in his own\r\nsharp bony elbows and shrunken shoulders as if realising what a pitiful\r\nspecimen of humanity he was by the side of that buxom, hardy creature\r\nso full of the life of ripe womanhood. Moreover, there was another\r\nreason why he recoiled from her. The smells of the markets distressed\r\nhim; on finishing his duties of an evening he would have liked to\r\nescape from the fishy odour amidst which his days were spent; but,\r\nalas! beautiful though La Normande was, this odour seemed to adhere to\r\nher silky skin. She had tried every sort of aromatic oil, and bathed\r\nfreely; but as soon as the freshening influence of the bath was over\r\nher blood again impregnated her skin with the faint odour of salmon,\r\nthe musky perfume of smelts, and the pungent scent of herrings and\r\nskate. Her skirts, too, as she moved about, exhaled these fishy smells,\r\nand she walked as though amidst an atmosphere redolent of slimy\r\nseaweed. With her tall, goddess-like figure, her purity of form, and\r\ntransparency of complexion she resembled some lovely antique marble\r\nthat had rolled about in the depths of the sea and had been brought to\r\nland in some fisherman\u2019s net.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget, however, swore by all her gods that Florent was the\r\nyoung woman\u2019s lover. According to her account, indeed, he courted both\r\nthe sisters. She had quarrelled with the beautiful Norman about a\r\nten-sou dab; and ever since this falling-out she had manifested warm\r\nfriendship for handsome Lisa. By this means she hoped the sooner to\r\narrive at a solution of what she called the Quenus\u2019 mystery. Florent\r\nstill continued to elude her curiosity, and she told her friends that\r\nshe felt like a body without a soul, though she was careful not to\r\nreveal what was troubling her so grievously. A young girl infatuated\r\nwith a hopeless passion could not have been in more distress than this\r\nterrible old woman at finding herself unable to solve the mystery of\r\nthe Quenus\u2019 cousin. She was constantly playing the spy on Florent,\r\nfollowing him about, and watching him, in a burning rage at her failure\r\nto satisfy her rampant curiosity. Now that he had begun to visit the\r\nMehudins she was for ever haunting the stairs and landings. She soon\r\ndiscovered that handsome Lisa was much annoyed at Florent visiting\r\n\u201Cthose women,\u201D and accordingly she called at the pork shop every\r\nmorning with a budget of information. She went in shrivelled and shrunk\r\nby the frosty air, and, resting her hands on the heating-pan to warm\r\nthem, remained in front of the counter buying nothing, but repeating in\r\nher shrill voice: \u201CHe was with them again yesterday; he seems to live\r\nthere now. I heard La Normande call him \u2018my dear\u2019 on the staircase.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe indulged like this in all sorts of lies in order to remain in the\r\nshop and continue warming her hands for a little longer. On the morning\r\nafter the evening when she had heard Claire close her door behind\r\nFlorent, she spun out her story for a good half hour, inventing all\r\nsorts of mendacious and abominable particulars.\r\n\r\nLisa, who had assumed a look of contemptuous scorn, said but little,\r\nsimply encouraging Mademoiselle Saget\u2019s gossip by her silence. At last,\r\nhowever, she interrupted her. \u201CNo, no,\u201D she said; \u201CI can\u2019t really\r\nlisten to all that. Is it possible that there can be such women?\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon Mademoiselle Saget told Lisa that unfortunately all women\r\nwere not so well conducted as herself. And then she pretended to find\r\nall sorts of excuses for Florent: it wasn\u2019t his fault; he was no doubt\r\na bachelor; these women had very likely inveigled him in their snares.\r\nIn this way she hinted questions without openly asking them. But Lisa\r\npreserved silence with respect to her cousin, merely shrugging her\r\nshoulders and compressing her lips. When Mademoiselle Saget at last\r\nwent away, the mistress of the shop glanced with disgust at the cover\r\nof the heating-pan, the glistening metal of which had been tarnished by\r\nthe impression of the old woman\u2019s little hands.\r\n\r\n\u201CAugustine,\u201D she cried, \u201Cbring a duster, and wipe the cover of the\r\nheating-pan. It\u2019s quite filthy!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between the beautiful Lisa and the beautiful Norman now\r\nbecame formidable. The beautiful Norman flattered herself that she had\r\ncarried a lover off from her enemy; and the beautiful Lisa was\r\nindignant with the hussy who, by luring the sly cousin to her home,\r\nwould surely end by compromising them all. The natural temperament of\r\neach woman manifested itself in the hostilities which ensued. The one\r\nremained calm and scornful, like a lady who holds up her skirts to keep\r\nthem from being soiled by the mud; while the other, much less subject\r\nto shame, displayed insolent gaiety and swaggered along the footways\r\nwith the airs of a duellist seeking a cause of quarrel. Each of their\r\nskirmishes would be the talk of the fish market for the whole day. When\r\nthe beautiful Norman saw the beautiful Lisa standing at the door of her\r\nshop, she would go out of her way in order to pass her, and brush\r\nagainst her with her apron; and then the angry glances of the two\r\nrivals crossed like rapiers, with the rapid flash and thrust of pointed\r\nsteel. When the beautiful Lisa, on the other hand, went to the fish\r\nmarket, she assumed an expression of disgust on approaching the\r\nbeautiful Norman\u2019s stall. And then she proceeded to purchase some big\r\nfish\u2014a turbot or a salmon\u2014of a neighbouring dealer, spreading her money\r\nout on the marble slab as she did so, for she had noticed that this\r\nseemed to have a painful effect upon the \u201Chussy,\u201D who ceased laughing\r\nat the sight. To hear the two rivals speak, anyone would have supposed\r\nthat the fish and pork they sold were quite unfit for food. However,\r\ntheir principal engagements took place when the beautiful Norman was\r\nseated at her stall and the beautiful Lisa at her counter, and they\r\nglowered blackly at each other across the Rue Rambuteau. They sat in\r\nstate in their big white aprons, decked out with showy toilets and\r\njewels, and the battle between them would commence early in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\u201CHallo, the fat woman\u2019s got up!\u201D the beautiful Norman would exclaim.\r\n\u201CShe ties herself up as tightly as her sausages! Ah, she\u2019s got\r\nSaturday\u2019s collar on again, and she\u2019s still wearing that poplin dress!\u201D\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, on the opposite side of the street, beautiful Lisa\r\nwas saying to her shop girl: \u201CJust look at that creature staring at us\r\nover yonder, Augustine! She\u2019s getting quite deformed by the life she\r\nleads. Do you see her earrings? She\u2019s wearing those big drops of hers,\r\nisn\u2019t she? It makes one feel ashamed to see a girl like that with\r\nbrilliants.\u201D\r\n\r\nAll complaisance, Augustine echoed her mistress\u2019s words.\r\n\r\nWhen either of them was able to display a new ornament it was like\r\nscoring a victory\u2014the other one almost choked with spleen. Every day\r\nthey would scrutinise and count each other\u2019s customers, and manifest\r\nthe greatest annoyance if they thought that the \u201Cbig thing over the\r\nway\u201D was doing the better business. Then they spied out what each had\r\nfor lunch. Each knew what the other ate, and even watched to see how\r\nshe digested it. In the afternoon, while the one sat amidst her cooked\r\nmeats and the other amidst her fish, they posed and gave themselves\r\nairs, as though they were queens of beauty. It was then that the\r\nvictory of the day was decided. The beautiful Norman embroidered,\r\nselecting the most delicate and difficult work, and this aroused Lisa\u2019s\r\nexasperation.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D she said, speaking of her rival, \u201Cshe had far better mend her\r\nboy\u2019s stockings. He\u2019s running about quite barefooted. Just look at that\r\nfine lady, with her red hands stinking of fish!\u201D\r\n\r\nFor her part, Lisa usually knitted.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s still at that same sock,\u201D La Normande would say, as she watched\r\nher. \u201CShe eats so much that she goes to sleep over her work. I pity her\r\npoor husband if he\u2019s waiting for those socks to keep his feet warm!\u201D\r\n\r\nThey would sit glowering at each other with this implacable hostility\r\nuntil evening, taking note of every customer, and displaying such keen\r\neyesight that they detected the smallest details of each other\u2019s dress\r\nand person when other women declared that they could see nothing at\r\nsuch a distance. Mademoiselle Saget expressed the highest admiration\r\nfor Madame Quenu\u2019s wonderful sight when she one day detected a scratch\r\non the fish-girl\u2019s left cheek. With eyes like those, said the old maid,\r\none might even see through a door. However, the victory often remained\r\nundecided when night fell; sometimes one or other of the rivals was\r\ntemporarily crushed, but she took her revenge on the morrow. Several\r\npeople of the neighbourhood actually laid wagers on these contests,\r\nsome backing the beautiful Lisa and others the beautiful Norman.\r\n\r\nAt last they ended by forbidding their children to speak to one\r\nanother. Pauline and Muche had formerly been good friends,\r\nnotwithstanding the girl\u2019s stiff petticoats and lady-like demeanour,\r\nand the lad\u2019s tattered appearance, coarse language, and rough manners.\r\nThey had at times played together at horses on the broad footway in\r\nfront of the fish market, Pauline always being the horse and Muche the\r\ndriver. One day, however, when the boy came in all simplicity to seek\r\nhis playmate, Lisa turned him out of the house, declaring that he was a\r\ndirty little street arab.\r\n\r\n\u201COne can\u2019t tell what may happen with children who have been so\r\nshockingly brought up,\u201D she observed.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, indeed; you are quite right,\u201D replied Mademoiselle Saget, who\r\nhappened to be present.\r\n\r\nWhen Muche, who was barely seven years old, came in tears to his mother\r\nto tell her of what had happened, La Normande broke out into a terrible\r\npassion. At the first moment she felt a strong inclination to rush over\r\nto the Quenu-Gradelles\u2019 and smash everything in their shop. But\r\neventually she contented herself with giving Muche a whipping.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf ever I catch you going there again,\u201D she cried, boiling over with\r\nanger, \u201Cyou\u2019ll get it hot from me, I can tell you!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent, however, was the real victim of the two women. It was he, in\r\ntruth, who had set them by the ears, and it was on his account that\r\nthey were fighting each other. Ever since he had appeared upon the\r\nscene things had been going from bad to worse. He compromised and\r\ndisturbed and embittered all these people, who had previously lived in\r\nsuch sleek peace and harmony. The beautiful Norman felt inclined to\r\nclaw him when he lingered too long with the Quenus, and it was chiefly\r\nfrom an impulse of hostile rivalry that she desired to win him to\r\nherself. The beautiful Lisa, on her side, maintained a cold judicial\r\nbearing, and although extremely annoyed, forced herself to silence\r\nwhenever she saw Florent leaving the pork shop to go to the Rue\r\nPirouette.\r\n\r\nStill, there was now much less cordiality than formerly round the\r\nQuenus\u2019 dinner-table in the evening. The clean, prim dining-room seemed\r\nto have assumed an aspect of chilling severity. Florent divined a\r\nreproach, a sort of condemnation in the bright oak, the polished lamp,\r\nand the new matting. He scarcely dared to eat for fear of letting\r\ncrumbs fall on the floor or soiling his plate. There was a guileless\r\nsimplicity about him which prevented him from seeing how the land\r\nreally lay. He still praised Lisa\u2019s affectionate kindliness on all\r\nsides; and outwardly, indeed, she did continue to treat him with all\r\ngentleness.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is very strange,\u201D she said to him one day with a smile, as though\r\nshe were joking; \u201Calthough you don\u2019t eat at all badly now, you don\u2019t\r\nget fatter. Your food doesn\u2019t seem to do you any good.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Quenu laughed aloud, and tapping his brother\u2019s stomach,\r\nprotested that the whole contents of the pork shop might pass through\r\nit without depositing a layer of fat as thick as a two-sou piece.\r\nHowever, Lisa\u2019s insistence on this particular subject was instinct with\r\nthat same suspicious dislike for fleshless men which Madame Mehudin\r\nmanifested more outspokenly; and behind it all there was likewise a\r\nveiled allusion to the disorderly life which she imagined Florent was\r\nleading. She never, however, spoke a word to him about La Normande.\r\nQuenu had attempted a joke on the subject one evening, but Lisa had\r\nreceived it so icily that the good man had not ventured to refer to the\r\nmatter again. They would remain seated at table for a few moments after\r\ndessert, and Florent, who had noticed his sister-in-law\u2019s vexation if\r\never he went off too soon, tried to find something to talk about. On\r\nthese occasions Lisa would be near him, and certainly he did not suffer\r\nin her presence from that fishy smell which assailed him when he was in\r\nthe company of La Normande. The mistress of the pork shop, on the\r\ncontrary, exhaled an odour of fat and rich meats. Moreover, not a\r\nthrill of life stirred her tight-fitting bodice; she was all\r\nmassiveness and all sedateness. Gavard once said to Florent in\r\nconfidence that Madame Quenu was no doubt handsome, but that for his\r\npart he did not admire such armour-plated women.\r\n\r\nLisa avoided talking to Quenu of Florent. She habitually prided herself\r\non her patience, and considered, too, that it would not be proper to\r\ncause any unpleasantness between the brothers, unless some peremptory\r\nreason for her interference should arise. As she said, she could put up\r\nwith a good deal, but, of course, she must not be tried too far. She\r\nhad now reached the period of courteous tolerance, wearing an\r\nexpressionless face, affecting perfect indifference and strict\r\npoliteness, and carefully avoiding everything which might seem to hint\r\nthat Florent was boarding and lodging with them without their receiving\r\nthe slightest payment from him. Not, indeed, that she would have\r\naccepted any payment from him, she was above all that; still he might,\r\nat any rate, she thought, have lunched away from the house.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe never seem to be alone now,\u201D she remarked to Quenu one day. \u201CIf\r\nthere is anything we want to say to one another we have to wait till we\r\ngo upstairs at night.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd then, one night when they were in bed, she said to him: \u201CYour\r\nbrother earns a hundred and fifty francs a month, doesn\u2019t he? Well,\r\nit\u2019s strange he can\u2019t put a trifle by to buy himself some more linen.\r\nI\u2019ve been obliged to give him three more of your old shirts.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, that doesn\u2019t matter,\u201D Quenu replied. \u201CFlorent\u2019s not hard to\r\nplease; and we must let him keep his money for himself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes, of course,\u201D said Lisa, without pressing the matter further.\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t mention it for that reason. Whether he spends his money well\r\nor ill, it isn\u2019t our business.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn her own mind she felt quite sure that he wasted his salary at the\r\nMehudins\u2019.\r\n\r\nOnly on one occasion did she break through her habitual calmness of\r\ndemeanour, the quiet reserve which was the result of both natural\r\ntemperament and preconceived design. The beautiful Norman had made\r\nFlorent a present of a magnificent salmon. Feeling very much\r\nembarrassed with the fish, and not daring to refuse it, he brought it\r\nto Lisa.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou can make a pasty of it,\u201D he said ingenuously.\r\n\r\nLisa looked at him sternly with whitening lips. Then, striving to\r\nrestrain her anger, she exclaimed: \u201CDo you think that we are short of\r\nfood? Thank God, we\u2019ve got quite enough to eat here! Take it back!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, at any rate, cook it for me,\u201D replied Florent, amazed by her\r\nanger; \u201CI\u2019ll eat it myself.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this she burst out furiously.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe house isn\u2019t an inn! Tell those who gave you the fish to cook it\r\nfor you! I won\u2019t have my pans tainted and infected! Take it back again!\r\nDo you hear?\u201D\r\n\r\nIf he had not gone away with it, she would certainly have seized it and\r\nhurled it into the street. Florent took it to Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, where\r\nRose was ordered to make a pasty of it; and one evening the pasty was\r\neaten in the little \u201Ccabinet,\u201D Gavard, who was present, \u201Cstanding\u201D some\r\noysters for the occasion. Florent now gradually came more and more\r\nfrequently to Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, till at last he was constantly to be\r\nmet in the little private room. He there found an atmosphere of heated\r\nexcitement in which his political feverishness could pulsate freely. At\r\ntimes, now, when he shut himself up in his garret to work, the quiet\r\nsimplicity of the little room irritated him, his theoretical search for\r\nliberty proved quite insufficient, and it became necessary that he\r\nshould go downstairs, sally out, and seek satisfaction in the trenchant\r\naxioms of Charvet and the wild outbursts of Logre. During the first few\r\nevenings the clamour and chatter had made him feel ill at ease; he was\r\nthen quite conscious of their utter emptiness, but he felt a need of\r\ndrowning his thoughts, of goading himself on to some extreme resolution\r\nwhich might calm his mental disquietude. The atmosphere of the little\r\nroom, reeking with the odour of spirits and warm with tobacco smoke,\r\nintoxicated him and filled him with peculiar beatitude, prompting a\r\nkind of self-surrender which made him willing to acquiesce in the\r\nwildest ideas. He grew attached to those he met there, and looked for\r\nthem and awaited their coming with a pleasure which increased with\r\nhabit. Robine\u2019s mild, bearded countenance, Clemence\u2019s serious profile,\r\nCharvet\u2019s fleshless pallor, Logre\u2019s hump, Gavard, Alexandre, and\r\nLacaille, all entered into his life, and assumed a larger and larger\r\nplace in it. He took quite a sensual enjoyment in these meetings. When\r\nhis fingers closed round the brass knob on the door of the little\r\ncabinet it seemed to be animated with life, to warm him, and turn of\r\nits own accord. Had he grasped the supple wrist of a woman he could not\r\nhave felt a more thrilling emotion.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, very serious things took place in that little room.\r\nOne evening, Logre, after indulging in wilder outbursts than usual,\r\nbanged his fist upon the table, declaring that if they were men they\r\nwould make a clean sweep of the Government. And he added that it was\r\nnecessary they should come to an understanding without further delay,\r\nif they desired to be fully prepared when the time for action arrived.\r\nThen they all bent their heads together, discussed the matter in lower\r\ntones, and decided to form a little \u201Cgroup,\u201D which should be ready for\r\nwhatever might happen. From that day forward Gavard flattered himself\r\nthat he was a member of a secret society, and was engaged in a\r\nconspiracy. The little circle received no new members, but Logre\r\npromised to put it into communication with other associations with\r\nwhich he was acquainted; and then, as soon as they held all Paris in\r\ntheir grasp, they would rise and make the Tuileries\u2019 people dance. A\r\nseries of endless discussions, renewed during several months, then\r\nbegan\u2014discussions on questions of organisation, on questions of ways\r\nand means, on questions of strategy, and of the form of the future\r\nGovernment. As soon as Rose had brought Clemence\u2019s grog, Charvet\u2019s and\r\nRobine\u2019s beer, the coffee for Logre, Gavard, and Florent, and the\r\nliqueur glasses of brandy for Lacaille and Alexandre, the door of the\r\ncabinet was carefully fastened, and the debate began.\r\n\r\nCharvet and Florent were naturally those whose utterances were listened\r\nto with the greatest attention. Gavard had not been able to keep his\r\ntongue from wagging, but had gradually related the whole story of\r\nCayenne; and Florent found himself surrounded by a halo of martyrdom.\r\nHis words were received as though they were the expression of\r\nindisputable dogmas. One evening, however, the poultry dealer, vexed at\r\nhearing his friend, who happened to be absent, attacked, exclaimed:\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t say anything against Florent; he\u2019s been to Cayenne!\u201D\r\n\r\nCharvet was rather annoyed by the advantage which this circumstance\r\ngave to Florent. \u201CCayenne, Cayenne,\u201D he muttered between his teeth.\r\n\u201CAh, well, they were not so badly off there, after all.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he attempted to prove that exile was a mere nothing, and that real\r\nsuffering consisted in remaining in one\u2019s oppressed country, gagged in\r\npresence of triumphant despotism. And besides, he urged, it wasn\u2019t his\r\nfault that he hadn\u2019t been arrested on the Second of December. Next,\r\nhowever, he hinted that those who had allowed themselves to be captured\r\nwere imbeciles. His secret jealousy made him a systematic opponent of\r\nFlorent; and the general discussions always ended in a duel between\r\nthese two, who, while their companions listened in silence, would speak\r\nagainst one another for hours at a time, without either of them\r\nallowing that he was beaten.\r\n\r\nOne of the favourite subjects of discussion was that of the\r\nreorganisation of the country which would have to be effected on the\r\nmorrow of their victory.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe are the conquerors, are we not?\u201D began Gavard.\r\n\r\nAnd, triumph being taken for granted, everyone offered his opinion.\r\nThere were two rival parties. Charvet, who was a disciple of H\u00E9bert,\r\nwas supported by Logre and Robine; while Florent, who was always\r\nabsorbed in humanitarian dreams, and called himself a Socialist, was\r\nbacked by Alexandre and Lacaille. As for Gavard, he felt no repugnance\r\nfor violent action; but, as he was often twitted about his fortune with\r\nno end of sarcastic witticisms which annoyed him, he declared himself a\r\nCommunist.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe must make a clean sweep of everything,\u201D Charvet would curtly say,\r\nas though he were delivering a blow with a cleaver. \u201CThe trunk is\r\nrotten, and it must come down.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes! yes!\u201D cried Logre, standing up that he might look taller, and\r\nmaking the partition shake with the excited motion of his hump.\r\n\u201CEverything will be levelled to the ground; take my word for it. After\r\nthat we shall see what to do.\u201D\r\n\r\nRobine signified approval by wagging his beard. His silence seemed\r\ninstinct with delight whenever violent revolutionary propositions were\r\nmade. His eyes assumed a soft ecstatic expression at the mention of the\r\nguillotine. He half closed them, as though he could see the machine,\r\nand was filled with pleasant emotion at the sight; and next he would\r\ngently rub his chin against the knob of his stick, with a subdued purr\r\nof satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201CAll the same,\u201D said Florent, in whose voice a vague touch of sadness\r\nlingered, \u201Cif you cut down the tree it will be necessary to preserve\r\nsome seed. For my part, I think that the tree ought to be preserved, so\r\nthat we may graft new life on it. The political revolution, you know,\r\nhas already taken place; to-day we have got to think of the labourer,\r\nthe working man. Our movement must be altogether a social one. I defy\r\nyou to reject the claims of the people. They are weary of waiting, and\r\nare determined to have their share of happiness.\u201D\r\n\r\nThese words aroused Alexandre\u2019s enthusiasm. With a beaming, radiant\r\nface he declared that this was true, that the people were weary of\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd we will have our share,\u201D added Lacaille, with a more menacing\r\nexpression. \u201CAll the revolutions that have taken place have been for\r\nthe good of the middle classes. We\u2019ve had quite enough of that sort of\r\nthing, and the next one shall be for our benefit.\u201D\r\n\r\nFrom this moment disagreement set in. Gavard offered to make a division\r\nof his property, but Logre declined, asserting that he cared nothing\r\nfor money. Then Charvet gradually overcame the tumult, till at last he\r\nalone was heard speaking.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe selfishness of the different classes does more than anything else\r\nto uphold tyranny,\u201D said he. \u201CIt is wrong of the people to display\r\negotism. If they assist us they shall have their share. But why should\r\nI fight for the working man if the working man won\u2019t fight for me?\r\nMoreover, that is not the question at present. Ten years of\r\nrevolutionary dictatorship will be necessary to accustom a nation like\r\nFrance to the fitting enjoyment of liberty.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAll the more so as the working man is not ripe for it, and requires to\r\nbe directed,\u201D said Clemence bluntly.\r\n\r\nShe but seldom spoke. This tall, serious looking girl, alone among so\r\nmany men, listened to all the political chatter with a learnedly\r\ncritical air. She leaned back against the partition, and every now and\r\nthen sipped her grog whilst gazing at the speakers with frowning brows\r\nor inflated nostrils, thus silently signifying her approval or\r\ndisapproval, and making it quite clear that she held decided opinions\r\nupon the most complicated matters. At times she would roll a cigarette,\r\nand puff slender whiffs of smoke from the corners of her mouth, whilst\r\nlending increased attention to what was being debated. It was as though\r\nshe were presiding over the discussion, and would award the prize to\r\nthe victor when it was finished. She certainly considered that it\r\nbecame her, as a woman, to display some reserve in her opinions, and to\r\nremain calm whilst the men grew more and more excited. Now and then,\r\nhowever, in the heat of the debate, she would let a word or a phrase\r\nescape her and \u201Cclench the matter\u201D even for Charvet himself, as Gavard\r\nsaid. In her heart she believed herself the superior of all these\r\nfellows. The only one of them for whom she felt any respect was Robine,\r\nand she would thoughtfully contemplate his silent bearing.\r\n\r\nNeither Florent nor any of the others paid any special attention to\r\nClemence. They treated her just as though she were a man, shaking hands\r\nwith her so roughly as almost to dislocate her arms. One evening\r\nFlorent witnessed the periodical settlement of accounts between her and\r\nCharvet. She had just received her pay, and Charvet wanted to borrow\r\nten francs from her; but she first of all insisted that they must\r\nreckon up how matters stood between them. They lived together in a\r\nvoluntary partnership, each having complete control of his or her\r\nearnings, and strictly paying his or her expenses. By so doing, said\r\nthey, they were under no obligations to one another, but retained\r\nentire freedom. Rent, food, washing, and amusements, were all noted\r\ndown and added up. That evening, when the accounts had been verified,\r\nClemence proved to Charvet that he already owed her five francs. Then\r\nshe handed him the other ten which he wished to borrow, and exclaimed:\r\n\u201CRecollect that you now owe me fifteen. I shall expect you to repay me\r\non the fifth, when you get paid for teaching little Lehudier.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen Rose was summoned to receive payment for the \u201Cdrinks,\u201D each\r\nproduced the few coppers required to discharge his or her liability.\r\nCharvet laughingly called Clemence an aristocrat because she drank\r\ngrog. She wanted to humiliate him, said he, and make him feel that he\r\nearned less than she did, which, as it happened, was the fact. Beneath\r\nhis laugh, however, there was a feeling of bitterness that the girl\r\nshould be better circumstanced than himself, for, in spite of his\r\ntheory of the equality of the sexes, this lowered him.\r\n\r\nAlthough the discussions in the little room had virtually no result,\r\nthey served to exercise the speakers\u2019 lungs. A tremendous hubbub\r\nproceeded from the sanctum, and the panes of frosted glass vibrated\r\nlike drum-skins. Sometimes the uproar became so great that Rose, while\r\nlanguidly serving some blouse-wearing customer in the shop, would turn\r\nher head uneasily.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, they\u2019re surely fighting together in there,\u201D the customer would\r\nsay, as he put his glass down on the zinc-covered counter, and wiped\r\nhis mouth with the back of his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, there\u2019s no fear of that,\u201D Monsieur Lebigre tranquilly replied.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s only some gentlemen talking together.\u201D\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lebigre, indeed, although very strict with his other\r\ncustomers, allowed the politicians to shout as loudly as they pleased,\r\nand never made the least remark on the subject. He would sit for hours\r\ntogether on the bench behind the counter, with his big head lolling\r\ndrowsily against the mirror, whilst he watched Rose uncorking the\r\nbottles and giving a wipe here and there with her duster. And in spite\r\nof the somniferous effects of the wine fumes and the warm streaming\r\ngaslight, he would keep his ears open to the sounds proceeding from the\r\nlittle room. At times, when the voices grew noisier than usual, he got\r\nup from his seat and went to lean against the partition; and\r\noccasionally he even pushed the door open, and went inside and sat down\r\nthere for a few minutes, giving Gavard a friendly slap on the thigh.\r\nAnd then he would nod approval of everything that was said. The poultry\r\ndealer asserted that although friend Lebigre hadn\u2019t the stuff of an\r\norator in him, they might safely reckon on him when the \u201Cshindy\u201D came.\r\n\r\nOne morning, however, at the markets, when a tremendous row broke out\r\nbetween Rose and one of the fish-wives, through the former accidentally\r\nknocking over a basket of herrings, Florent heard Rose\u2019s employer\r\nspoken of as a \u201Cdirty spy\u201D in the pay of the police. And after he had\r\nsucceeded in restoring peace, all sorts of stories about Monsieur\r\nLebigre were poured into his ears. Yes, the wine seller was in the pay\r\nof the police, the fish-wives said; all the neighbourhood knew it.\r\nBefore Mademoiselle Saget had begun to deal with him she had once met\r\nhim entering the Prefecture to make his report. It was asserted, too,\r\nthat he was a money-monger, a usurer, and lent petty sums by the day to\r\ncostermongers, and let out barrows to them, exacting a scandalous rate\r\nof interest in return. Florent was greatly disturbed by all this, and\r\nfelt it his duty to repeat it that evening to his fellow politicians.\r\nThe latter, however, only shrugged their shoulders, and laughed at his\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\n\u201CPoor Florent!\u201D Charvet exclaimed sarcastically; \u201Che imagines the whole\r\npolice force is on his track, just because he happens to have been sent\r\nto Cayenne!\u201D\r\n\r\nGavard gave his word of honour that Lebigre was perfectly staunch and\r\ntrue, while Logre, for his part, manifested extreme irritation. He\r\nfumed and declared that it would be quite impossible for them to get on\r\nif everyone was to be accused of being a police spy; for his own part,\r\nhe would rather stay at home, and have nothing more to do with\r\npolitics. Why, hadn\u2019t people even dared to say that he, Logre himself,\r\nwho had fought in \u201848 and \u201851, and had twice narrowly escaped\r\ntransportation, was a spy as well? As he shouted this out, he thrust\r\nhis jaws forward, and glared at the others as though he would have\r\nliked to ram the conviction that he had nothing to do with the police\r\ndown their throats. At the sight of his furious glances his companions\r\nmade gestures of protestation. However, Lacaille, on hearing Monsieur\r\nLebigre accused of usury, silently lowered his head.\r\n\r\nThe incident was forgotten in the discussions which ensued. Since Logre\r\nhad suggested a conspiracy, Monsieur Lebigre had grasped the hands of\r\nthe frequenters of the little room with more vigor than ever. Their\r\ncustom, to tell the truth, was of but small value to him, for they\r\nnever ordered more than one \u201Cdrink\u201D apiece. They drained the last drops\r\njust as they rose to leave, having been careful to allow a little to\r\nremain in their glasses, even during their most heated arguments. In\r\nthis wise the one \u201Cshout\u201D lasted throughout the evening. They shivered\r\nas they turned out into the cold dampness of the night, and for a\r\nmoment or two remained standing on the footway with dazzled eyes and\r\nbuzzing ears, as though surprised by the dark silence of the street.\r\nRose, meanwhile, fastened the shutters behind them. Then, quite\r\nexhausted, at a loss for another word they shook hands, separated, and\r\nwent their different ways, still mentally continuing the discussion of\r\nthe evening, and regretting that they could not ram their particular\r\ntheories down each other\u2019s throats. Robine walked away, with his bent\r\nback bobbing up and down, in the direction of the Rue Rambuteau; whilst\r\nCharvet and Clemence went off through the markets on their return to\r\nthe Luxembourg quarter, their heels sounding on the flag-stones in\r\nmilitary fashion, whilst they still discussed some question of politics\r\nor philosophy, walking along side by side, but never arm-in-arm.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy ripened very slowly. At the commencement of the summer\r\nthe plotters had got no further than agreeing that it was necessary a\r\nstroke should be attempted. Florent, who had at first looked upon the\r\nwhole business with a kind of distrust, had now, however, come to\r\nbelieve in the possibility of a revolutionary movement. He took up the\r\nmatter seriously; making notes, and preparing plans in writing, while\r\nthe others still did nothing but talk. For his part, he began to\r\nconcentrate his whole life in the one persistent idea which made his\r\nbrain throb night after night; and this to such a degree that he at\r\nlast took his brother Quenu with him to Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, as though\r\nsuch a course were quite natural. Certainly he had no thought of doing\r\nanything improper. He still looked upon Quenu as in some degree his\r\npupil, and may even have considered it his duty to start him on the\r\nproper path. Quenu was an absolute novice in politics, but after\r\nspending five or six evenings in the little room he found himself quite\r\nin accord with the others. When Lisa was not present he manifested much\r\ndocility, a sort of respect for his brother\u2019s opinions. But the\r\ngreatest charm of the affair for him was really the mild dissipation of\r\nleaving his shop and shutting himself up in the little room where the\r\nothers shouted so loudly, and where Clemence\u2019s presence, in his\r\nopinion, gave a tinge of rakishness and romance to the proceedings. He\r\nnow made all haste with his chitterlings in order that he might get\r\naway as early as possible, anxious to lose not a single word of the\r\ndiscussions, which seemed to him to be very brilliant, though he was\r\nnot always able to follow them. The beautiful Lisa did not fail to\r\nnotice his hurry to be gone, but as yet she refrained from saying\r\nanything. When Florent took him off, she simply went to the door-step,\r\nand watched them enter Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, her face paling somewhat,\r\nand a severe expression coming into her eyes.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as Mademoiselle Saget was peering out of her garret\r\ncasement, she recognised Quenu\u2019s shadow on the frosted glass of the\r\n\u201Ccabinet\u201D window facing the Rue Pirouette. She had found her casement\r\nan excellent post of observation, as it overlooked that milky\r\ntransparency, on which the gaslight threw silhouettes of the\r\npoliticians, with noses suddenly appearing and disappearing, gaping\r\njaws abruptly springing into sight and then vanishing, and huge arms,\r\napparently destitute of bodies, waving hither and thither. This\r\nextraordinary jumble of detached limbs, these silent but frantic\r\nprofiles, bore witness to the heated discussions that went on in the\r\nlittle room, and kept the old maid peering from behind her muslin\r\ncurtains until the transparency turned black. She shrewdly suspected\r\nsome \u201Cbit of trickery,\u201D as she phrased it. By continual watching she\r\nhad come to recognise the different shadows by their hands and hair and\r\nclothes. As she gazed upon the chaos of clenched fists, angry heads,\r\nand swaying shoulders, which seemed to have become detached from their\r\ntrunks and to roll about one atop of the other, she would exclaim\r\nunhesitatingly, \u201CAh, there\u2019s that big booby of a cousin; there\u2019s that\r\nmiserly old Gavard; and there\u2019s the hunchback; and there\u2019s that maypole\r\nof a Clemence!\u201D Then, when the action of the shadow-play became more\r\npronounced, and they all seemed to have lost control over themselves,\r\nshe felt an irresistible impulse to go downstairs to try to find out\r\nwhat was happening. Thus she now made a point of buying her\r\nblack-currant syrup at nights, pretending that she felt out-of-sorts in\r\nthe morning, and was obliged to take a sip as soon as ever she was out\r\nof bed. On the evening when she noticed Quenu\u2019s massive head shadowed\r\non the transparency in close proximity to Charvet\u2019s fist, she made her\r\nappearance at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s in a breathless condition. To gain\r\nmore time, she made Rose rinse out her little bottle for her; however,\r\nshe was about to return to her room when she heard the pork butcher\r\nexclaim with a sort of childish candour:\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, indeed, we\u2019ll stand for it no longer! We\u2019ll make a clean sweep of\r\nall those humbugging Deputies and Ministers! Yes, we\u2019ll send the whole\r\nlot packing.\u201D\r\n\r\nEight o\u2019clock had scarcely struck on the following morning when\r\nMademoiselle Saget was already at the pork shop. She found Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur and La Sarriette there, dipping their noses into the\r\nheating-pan, and buying hot sausages for breakfast. As the old maid had\r\nmanaged to draw them into her quarrel with La Normande with respect to\r\nthe ten-sou dab, they had at once made friends again with Lisa, and\r\nthey now had nothing but contempt for the handsome fish-girl, and\r\nassailed her and her sister as good-for-nothing hussies, whose only aim\r\nwas to fleece men of their money. This opinion had been inspired by the\r\nassertions of Mademoiselle Saget, who had declared to Madame Lec\u0153ur\r\nthat Florent had induced one of the two girls to coquette with Gavard,\r\nand that the four of them had indulged in the wildest dissipation at\r\nBarratte\u2019s\u2014of course, at the poultry dealer\u2019s expense. From the effects\r\nof this impudent story Madame Lec\u0153ur had not yet recovered; she wore a\r\ndoleful appearance, and her eyes were quite yellow with spleen.\r\n\r\nThat morning, however, it was for Madame Quenu that the old maid had a\r\nshock in store. She looked round the counter, and then in her most\r\ngentle voice remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CI saw Monsieur Quenu last night. They seem to enjoy themselves\r\nimmensely in that little room at Lebigre\u2019s, if one may judge from the\r\nnoise they make.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa had turned her head towards the street, listening very\r\nattentively, but apparently unwilling to show it. The old maid paused,\r\nhoping that one of the others would question her; and then, in a lower\r\ntone, she added: \u201CThey had a woman with them. Oh, I don\u2019t mean Monsieur\r\nQuenu, of course! I didn\u2019t say that; I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt must be Clemence,\u201D interrupted La Sarriette; \u201Ca big scraggy\r\ncreature who gives herself all sorts of airs just because she went to\r\nboarding school. She lives with a threadbare usher. I\u2019ve seen them\r\ntogether; they always look as though they were taking each other off to\r\nthe police station.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes; I know,\u201D replied the old maid, who, indeed, knew everything\r\nabout Charvet and Clemence, and whose only purpose was to alarm Lisa.\r\n\r\nThe mistress of the pork shop, however, never flinched. She seemed to\r\nbe absorbed in watching something of great interest in the market\r\nyonder. Accordingly the old maid had recourse to stronger measures. \u201CI\r\nthink,\u201D said she, addressing herself to Madame Lec\u0153ur, \u201Cthat you ought\r\nto advise your brother-in-law to be careful. Last night they were\r\nshouting out the most shocking things in that little room. Men really\r\nseem to lose their heads over politics. If anyone had heard them, it\r\nmight have been a very serious matter for them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh! Gavard will go his own way,\u201D sighed Madame Lec\u0153ur. \u201CIt only wanted\r\nthis to fill my cup. I shall die of anxiety, I am sure, if he ever gets\r\narrested.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, a gleam shot from her dim eyes. La Sarriette, however,\r\nlaughed and wagged her little face, bright with the freshness of the\r\nmorning air.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou should hear what Jules says of those who speak against the\r\nEmpire,\u201D she remarked. \u201CThey ought all to be thrown into the Seine, he\r\ntold me; for it seems there isn\u2019t a single respectable person amongst\r\nthem.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh! there\u2019s no harm done, of course, so long as only people like\r\nmyself hear their foolish talk,\u201D resumed Mademoiselle Saget. \u201CI\u2019d\r\nrather cut my hand off, you know, than make mischief. Last night now,\r\nfor instance, Monsieur Quenu was saying\u2014\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nShe again paused. Lisa had started slightly.\r\n\r\n\u201CMonsieur Quenu was saying that the Ministers and Deputies and all who\r\nare in power ought to be shot.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Lisa turned sharply, her face quite white and her hands\r\nclenched beneath her apron.\r\n\r\n\u201CQuenu said that?\u201D she curtly asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, indeed, and several other similar things that I can\u2019t recollect\r\nnow. I heard him myself. But don\u2019t distress yourself like that, Madame\r\nQuenu. You know very well that I sha\u2019n\u2019t breathe a word. I\u2019m quite old\r\nenough to know what might harm a man if it came out. Oh, no; it will go\r\nno further.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa had recovered her equanimity. She took a pride in the happy\r\npeacefulness of her home; she would not acknowledge that there had ever\r\nbeen the slightest difference between herself and her husband. And so\r\nnow she shrugged her shoulders and said with a smile: \u201COh, it\u2019s all a\r\npack of foolish nonsense.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen the three others were in the street together they agreed that\r\nhandsome Lisa had pulled a very doleful face; and they were unanimously\r\nof opinion that the mysterious goings-on of the cousin, the Mehudins,\r\nGavard, and the Quenus would end in trouble. Madame Lec\u0153ur inquired\r\nwhat was done to the people who got arrested \u201Cfor politics,\u201D but on\r\nthis point Mademoiselle Saget could not enlighten her; she only knew\r\nthat they were never seen again\u2014no, never. And this induced La\r\nSarriette to suggest that perhaps they were thrown into the Seine, as\r\nJules had said they ought to be.\r\n\r\nLisa avoided all reference to the subject at breakfast and dinner that\r\nday; and even in the evening, when Florent and Quenu went off together\r\nto Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, there was no unwonted severity in her glance. On\r\nthat particular evening, however, the question of framing a\r\nconstitution for the future came under discussion, and it was one\r\no\u2019clock in the morning before the politicians could tear themselves\r\naway from the little room. The shutters had already been fastened, and\r\nthey were obliged to leave by a small door, passing out one at a time\r\nwith bent backs. Quenu returned home with an uneasy conscience. He\r\nopened the three or four doors on his way to bed as gently as possible,\r\nwalking on tip-toe and stretching out his hands as he passed through\r\nthe sitting-room, to avoid a collision with any of the furniture. The\r\nwhole house seemed to be asleep. When he reached the bedroom, he was\r\nannoyed to find that Lisa had not extinguished the candle, which was\r\nburning with a tall, mournful flame in the midst of the deep silence.\r\nAs Quenu took off his shoes, and put them down in a corner, the\r\ntime-piece struck half past one with such a clear, ringing sound that\r\nhe turned in alarm, almost frightened to move, and gazing with an\r\nexpression of angry reproach at the shining gilded Gutenberg standing\r\nthere, with his finger on a book. Lisa\u2019s head was buried in her pillow,\r\nand Quenu could only see her back; but he divined that she was merely\r\nfeigning sleep, and her conduct in turning her back upon him was so\r\ninstinct with reproach that he felt sorely ill at ease. At last he\r\nslipped beneath the bed-clothes, blew out the candle, and lay perfectly\r\nstill. He could have sworn that his wife was awake, though she did not\r\nspeak to him; and presently he fell asleep, feeling intensely\r\nmiserable, and lacking the courage to say good night.\r\n\r\nHe slept till late, and when he awoke he found himself sprawling in the\r\nmiddle of the bed with the eider-down quilt up to his chin, whilst Lisa\r\nsat in front of the secr\u00E9taire, arranging some papers. His slumber had\r\nbeen so heavy that he had not heard her rise. However, he now took\r\ncourage, and spoke to her from the depths of the alcove: \u201CWhy didn\u2019t\r\nyou wake me? What are you doing there?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorting the papers in these drawers,\u201D she replied in her usual\r\ntone of voice.\r\n\r\nQuenu felt relieved. But Lisa added: \u201COne never knows what may happen.\r\nIf the police were to come\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat! the police?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, indeed, the police; for you\u2019re mixing yourself up with politics\r\nnow.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Quenu sat up in bed, quite dazed and confounded by such a\r\nviolent and unexpected attack.\r\n\r\n\u201CI mix myself up with politics! I mix myself up with politics!\u201D he\r\nrepeated. \u201CIt\u2019s no concern of the police. I\u2019ve nothing to do with any\r\ncompromising matters.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D replied Lisa, shrugging her shoulders; \u201Cyou merely talk about\r\nshooting everybody.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI! I!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. And you bawl it out in a public-house! Mademoiselle Saget heard\r\nyou. All the neighbourhood knows by this time that you are a Red\r\nRepublican!\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu fell back in bed again. He was not perfectly awake as yet. Lisa\u2019s\r\nwords resounded in his ears as though he already heard the heavy tramp\r\nof gendarmes at the bedroom door. He looked at her as she sat there,\r\nwith her hair already arranged, her figure tightly imprisoned in her\r\nstays, her whole appearance the same as it was on any other morning;\r\nand he felt more astonished than ever that she should be so neat and\r\nprim under such extraordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\n\u201CI leave you absolutely free, you know,\u201D she continued, as she went on\r\narranging the papers. \u201CI don\u2019t want to wear the breeches, as the saying\r\ngoes. You are the master, and you are at liberty to endanger your\r\nposition, compromise our credit, and ruin our business.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as Quenu tried to protest, she silenced him with a gesture. \u201CNo,\r\nno; don\u2019t say anything,\u201D she continued. \u201CThis is no quarrel, and I am\r\nnot even asking an explanation from you. But if you had consulted me,\r\nand we had talked the matter over together, I might have intervened.\r\nAh! it\u2019s a great mistake to imagine that women understand nothing about\r\npolitics. Shall I tell you what my politics are?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe had risen from her seat whilst speaking, and was now walking to and\r\nfro between the bed and the window, wiping as she went some specks of\r\ndust from the bright mahogany of the mirrored wardrobe and the\r\ndressing-table.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy politics are the politics of honest folks,\u201D said she. \u201CI\u2019m grateful\r\nto the Government when business is prosperous, when I can eat my meals\r\nin peace and comfort, and can sleep at nights without being awakened by\r\nthe firing of guns. There were pretty times in \u201848, were there not? You\r\nremember our uncle Gradelle, the worthy man, showing us his books for\r\nthat year? He lost more than six thousand francs. Now that we have got\r\nthe Empire, however, everything prospers. We sell our goods readily\r\nenough. You can\u2019t deny it. Well, then, what is it that you want? How\r\nwill you be better off when you have shot everybody?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe took her stand in front of the little night-table, crossed her arms\r\nover her breast, and fixed her eyes upon Quenu, who had shuffled\r\nhimself beneath the bed-clothes, almost out of sight. He attempted to\r\nexplain what it was that his friends wanted, but he got quite confused\r\nin his endeavours to summarise Florent\u2019s and Charvet\u2019s political and\r\nsocial systems; and could only talk about the disregard shown to\r\nprinciples, the accession of the democracy to power, and the\r\nregeneration of society, in such a strange tangled way that Lisa\r\nshrugged her shoulders, quite unable to understand him. At last,\r\nhowever, he extricated himself from his difficulties by declaring that\r\nthe Empire was the reign of licentiousness, swindling finance, and\r\nhighway robbery. And, recalling an expression of Logre\u2019s he added: \u201CWe\r\nare the prey of a band of adventurers, who are pillaging, violating,\r\nand assassinating France. We\u2019ll have no more of them.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa, however, still shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, and is that all you have got to say?\u201D she asked with perfect\r\ncoolness. \u201CWhat has all that got to do with me? Even supposing it were\r\ntrue, what then? Have I ever advised you to practise dishonest courses?\r\nHave I ever prompted you to dishonour your acceptances, or cheat your\r\ncustomers, or pile up money by fraudulent practices? Really, you\u2019ll end\r\nby making me quite angry! We are honest folks, and we don\u2019t pillage or\r\nassassinate anybody. That\u2019s quite sufficient. What other folks do is no\r\nconcern of ours. If they choose to be rogues it\u2019s their affair.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe looked quite majestic and triumphant; and again pacing the room,\r\ndrawing herself up to her full height, she resumed: \u201CA pretty notion it\r\nis that people are to let their business go to rack and ruin just to\r\nplease those who are penniless. For my part, I\u2019m in favour of making\r\nhay while the sun shines, and supporting a Government which promotes\r\ntrade. If it does do dishonourable things, I prefer to know nothing\r\nabout them. I know that I myself commit none, and that no one in the\r\nneighbourhood can point a finger at me. It\u2019s only fools who go tilting\r\nat windmills. At the time of the last elections, you remember, Gavard\r\nsaid that the Emperor\u2019s candidate had been bankrupt, and was mixed up\r\nin all sorts of scandalous matters. Well, perhaps that was true, I\r\ndon\u2019t deny it; but all the same, you acted wisely in voting for him,\r\nfor all that was not in question; you were not asked to lend the man\r\nany money or to transact any business with him, but merely to show the\r\nGovernment that you were pleased with the prosperity of the pork\r\ntrade.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this moment Quenu called to mind a sentence of Charvet\u2019s, asserting\r\nthat \u201Cthe bloated bourgeois, the sleek shopkeepers, who backed up that\r\nGovernment of universal gormandising, ought to be hurled into the\r\nsewers before all others, for it was owing to them and their gluttonous\r\negotism that tyranny had succeeded in mastering and preying upon the\r\nnation.\u201D He was trying to complete this piece of eloquence when Lisa,\r\ncarried off by her indignation, cut him short.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t talk such stuff! My conscience doesn\u2019t reproach me with\r\nanything. I don\u2019t owe a copper to anybody; I\u2019m not mixed up in any\r\ndishonest business; I buy and sell good sound stuff; and I charge no\r\nmore than others do. What you say may perhaps apply to people like our\r\ncousins, the Saccards. They pretend to be even ignorant that I am in\r\nParis; but I am prouder than they are, and I don\u2019t care a rap for their\r\nmillions. It\u2019s said that Saccard speculates in condemned buildings, and\r\ncheats and robs everybody. I\u2019m not surprised to hear it, for he was\r\nalways that way inclined. He loves money just for the sake of wallowing\r\nin it, and then tossing it out of his windows, like the imbecile he is.\r\nI can understand people attacking men of his stamp, who pile up\r\nexcessive fortunes. For my part, if you care to know it, I have but a\r\nbad opinion of Saccard. But we\u2014we who live so quietly and peaceably,\r\nwho will need at least fifteen years to put by sufficient money to make\r\nourselves comfortably independent, we who have no reason to meddle in\r\npolitics, and whose only aim is to bring up our daughter respectably,\r\nand to see that our business prospers\u2014why you must be joking to talk\r\nsuch stuff about us. We are honest folks!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe came and sat down on the edge of the bed. Quenu was already much\r\nshaken in his opinions.\r\n\r\n\u201CListen to me, now,\u201D she resumed in a more serious voice. \u201CYou surely\r\ndon\u2019t want to see your own shop pillaged, your cellar emptied, and your\r\nmoney taken from you? If these men who meet at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s\r\nshould prove triumphant, do you think that you would then lie as\r\ncomfortably in your bed as you do now? And on going down into the\r\nkitchen, do you imagine that you would set about making your galantines\r\nas peacefully as you will presently? No, no, indeed! So why do you talk\r\nabout overthrowing a Government which protects you, and enables you to\r\nput money by? You have a wife and a daughter, and your first duty is\r\ntowards them. You would be in fault if you imperilled their happiness.\r\nIt is only those who have neither home nor hearth, who have nothing to\r\nlose, who want to be shooting people. Surely you don\u2019t want to pull the\r\nchestnuts out of the fire for _them_! So stay quietly at home, you\r\nfoolish fellow, sleep comfortably, eat well, make money, keep an easy\r\nconscience, and leave France to free herself of the Empire if the\r\nEmpire annoys her. France can get on very well without _you_.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe laughed her bright melodious laugh as she finished; and Quenu was\r\nnow altogether convinced. Yes, she was right, after all; and she looked\r\nso charming, he thought, as she sat there on the edge of the bed, so\r\ntrim, although it was so early, so bright, and so fresh in the dazzling\r\nwhiteness of her linen. As he listened to her his eyes fell on their\r\nportraits hanging on either side of the fireplace. Yes, they were\r\ncertainly honest folks; they had such a respectable, well-to-do air in\r\ntheir black clothes and their gilded frames! The bedroom, too, looked\r\nas though it belonged to people of some account in the world. The lace\r\nsquares seemed to give a dignified appearance to the chairs; and the\r\ncarpet, the curtains, and the vases decorated with painted\r\nlandscapes\u2014all spoke of their exertions to get on in the world and\r\ntheir taste for comfort. Thereupon he plunged yet further beneath the\r\neider-down quilt, which kept him in a state of pleasant warmth. He\r\nbegan to feel that he had risked losing all these things at Monsieur\r\nLebigre\u2019s\u2014his huge bed, his cosy room, and his business, on which his\r\nthoughts now dwelt with tender remorse. And from Lisa, from the\r\nfurniture, from all his cosy surroundings, he derived a sense of\r\ncomfort which thrilled him with a delightful, overpowering charm.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou foolish fellow!\u201D said his wife, seeing that he was now quite\r\nconquered. \u201CA pretty business it was that you\u2019d embarked upon; but\r\nyou\u2019d have had to reckon with Pauline and me, I can tell you! And now\r\ndon\u2019t bother your head any more about the Government. To begin with,\r\nall Governments are alike, and if we didn\u2019t have this one, we should\r\nhave another. A Government is necessary. But the one thing is to be\r\nable to live on, to spend one\u2019s savings in peace and comfort when one\r\ngrows old, and to know that one has gained one\u2019s means honestly.\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu nodded his head in acquiescence, and tried to commence a\r\njustification of his conduct.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was Gavard\u2014,\u201D he began.\r\n\r\nBut Lisa\u2019s face again assumed a serious expression, and she interrupted\r\nhim sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, it was not Gavard. I know very well who it was; and it would be a\r\ngreat deal better if he would look after his own safety before\r\ncompromising that of others.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs it Florent you mean?\u201D Quenu timidly inquired after a pause.\r\n\r\nLisa did not immediately reply. She got up and went back to the\r\nsecr\u00E9taire, as if trying to restrain herself.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, it is Florent,\u201D she said presently, in incisive tones. \u201CYou know\r\nhow patient I am. I would bear almost anything rather than come between\r\nyou and your brother. The tie of relationship is a sacred thing. But\r\nthe cup is filled to overflowing now. Since your brother came here\r\nthings have been constantly getting worse and worse. But now, I won\u2019t\r\nsay anything more; it is better that I shouldn\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. Then, as her husband gazed up at the ceiling\r\nwith an air of embarrassment, she continued, with increased violence:\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, he seems to ignore all that we have done for him. We have put\r\nourselves to great inconvenience for his sake; we have given him\r\nAugustine\u2019s bedroom, and the poor girl sleeps without a murmur in a\r\nstuffy little closet where she can scarcely breathe. We board and lodge\r\nhim and give him every attention\u2014but no, he takes it all quite as a\r\nmatter of course. He is earning money, but what he does with it nobody\r\nknows; or, rather, one knows only too well.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut there\u2019s his share of the inheritance, you know,\u201D Quenu ventured to\r\nsay, pained at hearing his brother attacked.\r\n\r\nLisa suddenly stiffened herself as though she were stunned, and her\r\nanger vanished.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, you are right; there is his share of the inheritance. Here is the\r\nstatement of it, in this drawer. But he refused to take it; you\r\nremember, you were present, and heard him. That only proves that he is\r\na brainless, worthless fellow. If he had had an idea in his head, he\r\nwould have made something out of that money by now. For my own part, I\r\nshould be very glad to get rid of it; it would be a relief to us. I\r\nhave told him so twice, but he won\u2019t listen to me. You ought to\r\npersuade him to take it. Talk to him about it, will you?\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu growled something in reply; and Lisa refrained from pressing the\r\npoint further, being of opinion that she had done all that could be\r\nexpected of her.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is not like other men,\u201D she resumed. \u201CHe\u2019s not a comfortable sort\r\nof person to have in the house. I shouldn\u2019t have said this if we hadn\u2019t\r\ngot talking on the subject. I don\u2019t busy myself about his conduct,\r\nthough it\u2019s setting the whole neighbourhood gossiping about us. Let him\r\neat and sleep here, and put us about, if he likes; we can get over\r\nthat; but what I won\u2019t tolerate is that he should involve us in his\r\npolitics. If he tries to lead you off again, or compromises us in the\r\nleast degree, I shall turn him out of the house without the least\r\nhesitation. I warn you, and now you understand!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent was doomed. Lisa was making a great effort to restrain herself,\r\nto prevent the animosity which had long been rankling in her heart from\r\nflowing forth. But Florent and his ways jarred against her every\r\ninstinct; he wounded her, frightened her, and made her quite miserable.\r\n\r\n\u201CA man who has made such a discreditable career,\u201D she murmured, \u201Cwho\r\nhas never been able to get a roof of his own over his head! I can very\r\nwell understand his partiality for bullets! He can go and stand in\r\ntheir way if he chooses; but let him leave honest folks to their\r\nfamilies! And then, he isn\u2019t pleasant to have about one! He reeks of\r\nfish in the evening at dinner! It prevents me from eating. He himself\r\nnever lets a mouthful go past him, though it\u2019s little better he seems\r\nto be for it all! He can\u2019t even grow decently stout, the wretched\r\nfellow, to such a degree do his bad instincts prey on him!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe had stepped up to the window whilst speaking, and now saw Florent\r\ncrossing the Rue Rambuteau on his way to the fish market. There was a\r\nvery large arrival of fish that morning; the tray-like baskets were\r\ncovered with rippling silver, and the auction rooms roared with the\r\nhubbub of their sales. Lisa kept her eyes on the bony shoulders of her\r\nbrother-in-law as he made his way into the pungent smells of the\r\nmarket, stooping beneath the sickening sensation which they brought\r\nhim; and the glance with which she followed his steps was that of a\r\nwoman bent on combat and resolved to be victorious.\r\n\r\nWhen she turned round again, Quenu was getting up. As he sat on the\r\nedge of the bed in his night-shirt, still warm from the pleasant heat\r\nof the eider-down quilt and with his feet resting on the soft fluffy\r\nrug below him, he looked quite pale, quite distressed at the\r\nmisunderstanding between his wife and his brother. Lisa, however, gave\r\nhim one of her sweetest smiles, and he felt deeply touched when she\r\nhanded him his socks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nMarjolin had been found in a heap of cabbages at the Market of the\r\nInnocents. He was sleeping under the shelter of a large white-hearted\r\none, a broad leaf of which concealed his rosy childish face It was\r\nnever known what poverty-stricken mother had laid him there. When he\r\nwas found he was already a fine little fellow of two or three years of\r\nage, very plump and merry, but so backward and dense that he could\r\nscarcely stammer a few words, and only seemed able to smile. When one\r\nof the vegetable saleswomen found him lying under the big white cabbage\r\nshe raised such a loud cry of surprise that her neighbours rushed up to\r\nsee what was the matter, while the youngster, still in petticoats, and\r\nwrapped in a scrap of old blanket, held out his arms towards her. He\r\ncould not tell who his mother was, but opened his eyes in wide\r\nastonishment as he squeezed against the shoulder of a stout tripe\r\ndealer who eventually took him up. The whole market busied itself about\r\nhim throughout the day. He soon recovered confidence, ate slices of\r\nbread and butter, and smiled at all the women. The stout tripe dealer\r\nkept him for a time, then a neighbour took him; and a month later a\r\nthird woman gave him shelter. When they asked him where his mother was,\r\nhe waved his little hand with a pretty gesture which embraced all the\r\nwomen present. He became the adopted child of the place, always\r\nclinging to the skirts of one or another of the women, and always\r\nfinding a corner of a bed and a share of a meal somewhere. Somehow,\r\ntoo, he managed to find clothes, and he even had a copper or two at the\r\nbottom of his ragged pockets. It was a buxom, ruddy girl dealing in\r\nmedicinal herbs who gave him the name of Marjolin,[*] though no one\r\nknew why.\r\n\r\n[*] Literally \u201CMarjoram.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Marjolin was nearly four years of age, old Mother Chantemesse also\r\nhappened to find a child, a little girl, lying on the footway of the\r\nRue Saint Denis, near the corner of the market. Judging by the little\r\none\u2019s size, she seemed to be a couple of years old, but she could\r\nalready chatter like a magpie, murdering her words in an incessant\r\nchildish babble. Old Mother Chantemesse after a time gathered that her\r\nname was Cadine, and that on the previous evening her mother had left\r\nher sitting on a doorstep, with instructions to wait till she returned.\r\nThe child had fallen asleep there, and did not cry. She related that\r\nshe was beaten at home; and she gladly followed Mother Chantemesse,\r\nseemingly quite enchanted with that huge square, where there were so\r\nmany people and such piles of vegetables. Mother Chantemesse, a retail\r\ndealer by trade, was a crusty but very worthy woman, approaching her\r\nsixtieth year. She was extremely fond of children, and had lost three\r\nboys of her own when they were mere babies. She came to the opinion\r\nthat the chit she had found \u201Cwas far too wide awake to kick the\r\nbucket,\u201D and so she adopted her.\r\n\r\nOne evening, however, as she was going off home with her right hand\r\nclasping Cadine\u2019s, Marjolin came up and unceremoniously caught hold of\r\nher left hand.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, my lad,\u201D said the old woman, stopping, \u201Cthe place is filled. Have\r\nyou left your big Therese, then? What a fickle little gadabout you\r\nare!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe boy gazed at her with his smiling eyes, without letting go of her\r\nhand. He looked so pretty with his curly hair that she could not resist\r\nhim. \u201CWell, come along, then, you little scamp,\u201D said she; \u201CI\u2019ll put\r\nyou to bed as well.\u201D\r\n\r\nThus she made her appearance in the Rue au Lard, where she lived, with\r\na child clinging to either hand. Marjolin made himself quite at home\r\nthere. When the two children proved too noisy the old woman cuffed\r\nthem, delighted to shout and worry herself, and wash the youngsters,\r\nand pack them away beneath the blankets. She had fixed them up a little\r\nbed in an old costermonger\u2019s barrow, the wheels and shafts of which had\r\ndisappeared. It was like a big cradle, a trifle hard, but retaining a\r\nstrong scent of the vegetables which it had long kept fresh and cool\r\nbeneath a covering of damp cloths. And there, when four years old,\r\nCadine and Marjolin slept locked in each other\u2019s arms.\r\n\r\nThey grew up together, and were always to be seen with their arms about\r\none another\u2019s waist. At night time old Mother Chantemesse heard them\r\nprattling softly. Cadine\u2019s clear treble went chattering on for hours\r\ntogether, while Marjolin listened with occasional expressions of\r\nastonishment vented in a deeper tone. The girl was a mischievous young\r\ncreature, and concocted all sorts of stories to frighten her companion;\r\ntelling him, for instance, that she had one night seen a man, dressed\r\nall in white, looking at them and putting out a great red tongue, at\r\nthe foot of the bed. Marjolin quite perspired with terror, and\r\nanxiously asked for further particulars; but the girl would then begin\r\nto jeer at him, and end by calling him a big donkey. At other times\r\nthey were not so peaceably disposed, but kicked each other beneath the\r\nblankets. Cadine would pull up her legs, and try to restrain her\r\nlaughter as Marjolin missed his aim, and sent his feet banging against\r\nthe wall. When this happened, old Madame Chantemesse was obliged to get\r\nup to put the bed-clothes straight again; and, by way of sending the\r\nchildren to sleep, she would administer a box on the ear to both of\r\nthem. For a long time their bed was a sort of playground. They carried\r\ntheir toys into it, and munched stolen carrots and turnips as they lay\r\nside by side. Every morning their adopted mother was amazed at the\r\nstrange things she found in the bed\u2014pebbles, leaves, apple cores, and\r\ndolls made out of scraps of rags. When the very cold weather came, she\r\nwent off to her work, leaving them sleeping there, Cadine\u2019s black mop\r\nmingling with Marjolin\u2019s sunny curls, and their mouths so near together\r\nthat they looked as though they were keeping each other warm with their\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nThe room in the Rue au Lard was a big, dilapidated garret, with a\r\nsingle window, the panes of which were dimmed by the rain. The children\r\nwould play at hide-and-seek in the tall walnut wardrobe and underneath\r\nMother Chantemesse\u2019s colossal bed. There were also two or three tables\r\nin the room, and they crawled under these on all fours. They found the\r\nplace a very charming playground, on account of the dim light and the\r\nvegetables scattered about in the dark corners. The street itself, too,\r\nnarrow and very quiet, with a broad arcade opening into the Rue de la\r\nLingerie, provided them with plenty of entertainment. The door of the\r\nhouse was by the side of the arcade; it was a low door and could only\r\nbe opened half way owing to the near proximity of the greasy corkscrew\r\nstaircase. The house, which had a projecting pent roof and a bulging\r\nfront, dark with damp, and displaying greenish drain-sinks near the\r\nwindows of each floor, also served as a big toy for the young couple.\r\nThey spent their mornings below in throwing stones up into the\r\ndrain-sinks, and the stones thereupon fell down the pipes with a very\r\nmerry clatter. In thus amusing themselves, however, they managed to\r\nbreak a couple of windows, and filled the drains with stones, so that\r\nMother Chantemesse, who had lived in the house for three and forty\r\nyears, narrowly escaped being turned out of it.\r\n\r\nCadine and Marjolin then directed their attention to the vans and drays\r\nand tumbrels which were drawn up in the quiet street. They clambered on\r\nto the wheels, swung from the dangling chains, and larked about amongst\r\nthe piles of boxes and hampers. Here also were the back premises of the\r\ncommission agents of the Rue de la Poterie\u2014huge, gloomy warehouses,\r\neach day filled and emptied afresh, and affording a constant succession\r\nof delightful hiding-places, where the youngsters buried themselves\r\namidst the scent of dried fruits, oranges, and fresh apples. When they\r\ngot tired of playing in his way, they went off to join old Madame\r\nChantemesse at the Market of the Innocents. They arrived there\r\narm-in-arm, laughing gaily as they crossed the streets with never the\r\nslightest fear of being run over by the endless vehicles. They knew the\r\npavement well, and plunged their little legs knee-deep in the vegetable\r\nrefuse without ever slipping. They jeered merrily at any porter in\r\nheavy boots who, in stepping over an artichoke stem, fell sprawling\r\nfull-length upon the ground. They were the rosy-cheeked familiar\r\nspirits of those greasy streets. They were to be seen everywhere.\r\n\r\nOn rainy days they walked gravely beneath the shelter of a ragged old\r\numbrella, with which Mother Chantemesse had protected her\r\nstock-in-trade for twenty years, and sticking it up in a corner of the\r\nmarket they called it their house. On sunny days they romped to such a\r\ndegree that when evening came they were almost too tired to move. They\r\nbathed their feet in the fountains, dammed up the gutters, or hid\r\nthemselves beneath piles of vegetables, and remained there prattling to\r\neach other just as they did in bed at night. People passing some huge\r\nmountain of cos or cabbage lettuces often heard a muffled sound of\r\nchatter coming from it. And when the green-stuff was removed, the two\r\nchildren would be discovered lying side by side on their couch of\r\nverdure, their eyes glistening uneasily like those of birds discovered\r\nin the depth of a thicket. As time went on, Cadine could not get along\r\nwithout Marjolin, and Marjolin began to cry when he lost sight of\r\nCadine. If they happened to get separated, they sought one another\r\nbehind the petticoats of every stallkeeper in the markets, amongst the\r\nboxes and under the cabbages. If was, indeed, chiefly under the\r\ncabbages that they grew up and learned to love each other.\r\n\r\nMarjolin was nearly eight years old, and Cadine six, when old Madame\r\nChantemesse began to reproach them for their idleness. She told them\r\nthat she would interest them in her business, and pay them a sou a day\r\nto assist her in paring her vegetables. During the first few days the\r\nchildren displayed eager zeal; they squatted down on either side of the\r\nbig flat basket with little knives in their hands, and worked away\r\nenergetically. Mother Chantemesse made a specialty of pared vegetables;\r\non her stall, covered with a strip of damp black lining, were little\r\nlots of potatoes, turnips, carrots, and white onions, arranged in\r\npyramids of four\u2014three at the base and one at the apex, all quite ready\r\nto be popped into the pans of dilatory housewives. She also had bundles\r\nduly stringed in readiness for the soup-pot\u2014four leeks, three carrots,\r\na parsnip, two turnips, and a couple of springs of celery. Then there\r\nwere finely cut vegetables for julienne soup laid out on squares of\r\npaper, cabbages cut into quarters, and little heaps of tomatoes and\r\nslices of pumpkin which gleamed like red stars and golden crescents\r\namidst the pale hues of the other vegetables. Cadine evinced much more\r\ndexterity than Marjolin, although she was younger. The peelings of the\r\npotatoes she pared were so thin that you could see through them; she\r\ntied up the bundles for the soup-pot so artistically that they looked\r\nlike bouquets; and she had a way of making the little heaps she set up,\r\nthough they contained but three carrots or turnips, look like very big\r\nones. The passers-by would stop and smile when she called out in her\r\nshrill childish voice: \u201CMadame! madame! come and try me! Each little\r\npile for two sous.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe had her regular customers, and her little piles and bundles were\r\nwidely known. Old Mother Chantemesse, seated between the two children,\r\nwould indulge in a silent laugh which made her bosom rise almost to her\r\nchin, at seeing them working away so seriously. She paid them their\r\ndaily sous most faithfully. But they soon began to weary of the little\r\nheaps and bundles; they were growing up, and began to dream of some\r\nmore lucrative business. Marjolin remained very childish for his years,\r\nand this irritated Cadine. He had no more brains than a cabbage, she\r\noften said. And it was, indeed, quite useless for her to devise any\r\nplan for him to make money; he never earned any. He could not even do\r\nan errand satisfactorily. The girl, on the other hand, was very shrewd.\r\nWhen but eight years old she obtained employment from one of those\r\nwomen who sit on a bench in the neighbourhood of the markets provided\r\nwith a basket of lemons, and employ a troop of children to go about\r\nselling them. Carrying the lemons in her hands and offering them at two\r\nfor three sous, Cadine thrust them under every woman\u2019s nose, and ran\r\nafter every passer-by. Her hands empty, she hastened back for a fresh\r\nsupply. She was paid two sous for every dozen lemons that she sold, and\r\non good days she could earn some five or six sous. During the following\r\nyear she hawked caps at nine sous apiece, which proved a more\r\nprofitable business; only she had to keep a sharp look-out, as street\r\ntrading of this kind is forbidden unless one be licensed. However, she\r\nscented a policeman at a distance of a hundred yards; and the caps\r\nforthwith disappeared under her skirts, whilst she began to munch an\r\napple with an air of guileless innocence. Then she took to selling\r\npastry, cakes, cherry-tarts, gingerbread, and thick yellow maize\r\nbiscuits on wicker trays. Marjolin, however, ate up nearly the whole of\r\nher stock-in-trade. At last, when she was eleven years old, she\r\nsucceeded in realising a grand idea which had long been worrying her.\r\nIn a couple of months she put by four francs, bought a small\r\n_hotte_,[*] and then set up as a dealer in birds\u2019 food.\r\n\r\n[*] A basket carried on the back.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a big affair. She got up early in the morning and purchased her\r\nstock of groundsel, millet, and bird-cake from the wholesale dealers.\r\nThen she set out on her day\u2019s work, crossing the river, and\r\nperambulating the Latin Quarter from the Rue Saint Jacques to the Rue\r\nDauphine, and even to the Luxembourg. Marjolin used to accompany her,\r\nbut she would not let him carry the basket. He was only fit to call\r\nout, she said; and so, in his thick, drawling voice, he would raise the\r\ncry, \u201CChickweed for the little birds!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Cadine herself, with her flute-like voice, would start on a\r\nstrange scale of notes ending in a clear, protracted alto, \u201CChickweed\r\nfor the little birds!\u201D\r\n\r\nThey each took one side of the road, and looked up in the air as they\r\nwalked along. In those days Marjolin wore a big scarlet waistcoat which\r\nhung down to his knees; it had belonged to the defunct Monsieur\r\nChantemesse, who had been a cab-driver. Cadine for her part wore a\r\nwhite and blue check gown, made out of an old tartan of Madame\r\nChantemesse\u2019s. All the canaries in the garrets of the Latin Quarter\r\nknew them; and, as they passed along, repeating their cry, each echoing\r\nthe other\u2019s voice, every cage poured out a song.\r\n\r\nCadine sold water-cress, too. \u201CTwo sous a bunch! Two sous a bunch!\u201D And\r\nMarjolin went into the shops to offer it for sale. \u201CFine water-cress!\r\nHealth for the body! Fine fresh water-cress!\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, the new central markets had just been erected, and the girl\r\nwould stand gazing in ecstacy at the avenue of flower stalls which runs\r\nthrough the fruit pavilion. Here on either hand, from end to end, big\r\nclumps of flowers bloom as in the borders of a garden walk. It is a\r\nperfect harvest, sweet with perfume, a double hedge of blossoms,\r\nbetween which the girls of the neighbourhood love to walk, smiling the\r\nwhile, though almost stifled by the heavy perfume. And on the top tiers\r\nof the stalls are artificial flowers, with paper leaves, in which\r\ndewdrops are simulated by drops of gum; and memorial wreaths of black\r\nand white beads rippling with bluish reflections. Cadine\u2019s rosy\r\nnostrils would dilate with feline sensuality; she would linger as long\r\nas possible in that sweet freshness, and carry as much of the perfume\r\naway with her as she could. When her hair bobbed under Marjolin\u2019s nose\r\nhe would remark that it smelt of pinks. She said that she had given\r\nover using pomatum; that is was quite sufficient for her to stroll\r\nthrough the flower walk in order to scent her hair. Next she began to\r\nintrigue and scheme with such success that she was engaged by one of\r\nthe stallkeepers. And then Marjolin declared that she smelt sweet from\r\nhead to foot. She lived in the midst of roses, lilacs, wall-flowers,\r\nand lilies of the valley; and Marjolin would playfully smell at her\r\nskirts, feign a momentary hesitation, and then exclaim, \u201CAh, that\u2019s\r\nlily of the valley!\u201D Next he would sniff at her waist and bodice: \u201CAh,\r\nthat\u2019s wall-flowers!\u201D And at her sleeves and wrists: \u201CAh, that\u2019s\r\nlilac!\u201D And at her neck, and her cheeks and lips: \u201CAh, but that\u2019s\r\nroses!\u201D he would cry. Cadine used to laugh at him, and call him a\r\n\u201Csilly stupid,\u201D and tell him to get away, because he was tickling her\r\nwith the tip of his nose. As she spoke her breath smelt of jasmine. She\r\nwas verily a bouquet, full of warmth and life.\r\n\r\nShe now got up at four o\u2019clock every morning to assist her mistress in\r\nher purchases. Each day they bought armfuls of flowers from the\r\nsuburban florists, with bundles of moss, and bundles of fern fronds,\r\nand periwinkle leaves to garnish the bouquets. Cadine would gaze with\r\namazement at the diamonds and Valenciennes worn by the daughters of the\r\ngreat gardeners of Montreuil, who came to the markets amidst their\r\nroses.\r\n\r\nOn the saints\u2019 days of popular observance, such as Saint Mary\u2019s, Saint\r\nPeter\u2019s, and Saint Joseph\u2019s days, the sale of flowers began at two\r\no\u2019clock. More than a hundred thousand francs\u2019 worth of cut flowers\r\nwould be sold on the footways, and some of the retail dealers would\r\nmake as much as two hundred francs in a few hours. On days like those\r\nonly Cadine\u2019s curly locks peered over the mounds of pansies,\r\nmignonette, and marguerites. She was quite drowned and lost in the\r\nflood of flowers. Then she would spend all her time in mounting\r\nbouquets on bits of rush. In a few weeks she acquired considerable\r\nskillfulness in her business, and manifested no little originality. Her\r\nbouquets did not always please everybody, however. Sometimes they made\r\none smile, sometimes they alarmed the eyes. Red predominated in them,\r\nmottled with violent tints of blue, yellow, and violet of a barbaric\r\ncharm. On the mornings when she pinched Marjolin, and teased him till\r\nshe made him cry, she made up fierce-looking bouquets, suggestive of\r\nher own bad temper, bouquets with strong rough scents and glaring\r\nirritating colours. On other days, however, when she was softened by\r\nsome thrill of joy or sorrow, her bouquets would assume a tone of\r\nsilvery grey, very soft and subdued, and delicately perfumed.\r\n\r\nThen, too, she would set roses, as sanguineous as open hearts, in lakes\r\nof snow-white pinks; arrange bunches of tawny iris that shot up in\r\ntufts of flame from foliage that seemed scared by the brilliance of the\r\nflowers; work elaborate designs, as complicated as those of Smyrna\r\nrugs, adding flower to flower, as on a canvas; and prepare rippling\r\nfanlike bouquets spreading out with all the delicacy of lace. Here was\r\na cluster of flowers of delicious purity, there a fat nosegay, whatever\r\none might dream of for the hand of a marchioness or a fish-wife; all\r\nthe charming quaint fancies, in short, which the brain of a\r\nsharp-witted child of twelve, budding into womanhood, could devise.\r\n\r\nThere were only two flowers for which Cadine retained respect; white\r\nlilac, which by the bundle of eight or ten sprays cost from fifteen to\r\ntwenty francs in the winter time; and camellias, which were still more\r\ncostly, and arrived in boxes of a dozen, lying on beds of moss, and\r\ncovered with cotton wool. She handled these as delicately as though\r\nthey were jewels, holding her breath for fear of dimming their lustre,\r\nand fastening their short stems to springs of cane with the tenderest\r\ncare. She spoke of them with serious reverence. She told Marjolin one\r\nday that a speckless white camellia was a very rare and exceptionally\r\nlovely thing, and, as she was making him admire one, he exclaimed:\r\n\u201CYes; it\u2019s pretty; but I prefer your neck, you know. It\u2019s much more\r\nsoft and transparent than the camellia, and there are some little blue\r\nand pink veins just like the pencillings on a flower.\u201D Then, drawing\r\nnear and sniffing, he murmured: \u201CAh! you smell of orange blossom\r\nto-day.\u201D\r\n\r\nCadine was self-willed, and did not get on well in the position of a\r\nservant, so she ended by setting up in business on her own account. As\r\nshe was only thirteen at the time, and could not hope for a big trade\r\nand a stall in the flower avenue, she took to selling one-sou bunches\r\nof violets pricked into a bed of moss in an osier tray which she\r\ncarried hanging from her neck. All day long she wandered about the\r\nmarkets and their precincts with her little bit of hanging garden. She\r\nloved this continual stroll, which relieved the numbness of her limbs\r\nafter long hours spent, with bent knees, on a low chair, making\r\nbouquets. She fastened her violets together with marvellous deftness as\r\nshe walked along. She counted out six or eight flowers, according to\r\nthe season, doubled a sprig of cane in half, added a leaf, twisted some\r\ndamp thread round the whole, and broke off the thread with her strong\r\nyoung teeth. The little bunches seemed to spring spontaneously from the\r\nlayer of moss, so rapidly did she stick them into it.\r\n\r\nAlong the footways, amidst the jostling of the street traffic, her\r\nnimble fingers were ever flowering though she gave them not a glance,\r\nbut boldly scanned the shops and passers-by. Sometimes she would rest\r\nin a doorway for a moment; and alongside the gutters, greasy with\r\nkitchen slops, she sat, as it were a patch of springtime, a suggestion\r\nof green woods, and purple blossoms. Her flowers still betokened her\r\nframe of mind, her fits of bad temper and her thrills of tenderness.\r\nSometimes they bristled and glowered with anger amidst their crumpled\r\nleaves; at other times they spoke only of love and peacefulness as they\r\nsmiled in their prim collars. As Cadine passed along, she left a sweet\r\nperfume behind her; Marjolin followed her devoutly. From head to foot\r\nshe now exhaled but one scent, and the lad repeated that she was\r\nherself a violet, a great big violet.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you remember the day when we went to Romainville together?\u201D he\r\nwould say; \u201CRomainville, where there are so many violets. The scent was\r\njust the same. Oh! don\u2019t change again\u2014you smell too sweetly.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd she did not change again. This was her last trade. Still, she often\r\nneglected her osier tray to go rambling about the neighbourhood. The\r\nbuilding of the central markets\u2014as yet incomplete\u2014provided both\r\nchildren with endless opportunities for amusement. They made their way\r\ninto the midst of the work-yards through some gap or other between the\r\nplanks; they descended into the foundations, and climbed up to the\r\ncast-iron pillars. Every nook, every piece of the framework witnessed\r\ntheir games and quarrels; the pavilions grew up under the touch of\r\ntheir little hands. From all this arose the affection which they felt\r\nfor the great markets, and which the latter seemed to return. They were\r\non familiar terms with that gigantic pile, old friends as they were,\r\nwho had seen each pin and bolt put into place. They felt no fear of the\r\nhuge monster; but slapped it with their childish hands, treated it like\r\na good friend, a chum whose presence brought no constraint. And the\r\nmarkets seemed to smile at these two light-hearted children, whose love\r\nwas the song, the idyll of their immensity.\r\n\r\nCadine alone now slept at Mother Chantemesse\u2019s. The old woman had\r\npacked Marjolin off to a neighbour\u2019s. This made the two children very\r\nunhappy. Still, they contrived to spend much of their time together. In\r\nthe daytime they would hide themselves away in the warehouses of the\r\nRue au Lard, behind piles of apples and cases of oranges; and in the\r\nevening they would dive into the cellars beneath the poultry market,\r\nand secret themselves among the huge hampers of feathers which stood\r\nnear the blocks where the poultry was killed. They were quite alone\r\nthere, amidst the strong smell of the poultry, and with never a sound\r\nbut the sudden crowing of some rooster to break upon their babble and\r\ntheir laughter. The feathers amidst which they found themselves were of\r\nall sorts\u2014turkey\u2019s feathers, long and black; goose quills, white and\r\nflexible; the downy plumage of ducks, soft like cotton wool; and the\r\nruddy and mottled feathers of fowls, which at the faintest breath flew\r\nup in a cloud like a swarm of flies buzzing in the sun. And then in\r\nwintertime there was the purple plumage of the pheasants, the ashen\r\ngrey of the larks, the splotched silk of the partridges, quails, and\r\nthrushes. And all these feathers freshly plucked were still warm and\r\nodoriferous, seemingly endowed with life. The spot was as cosy as a\r\nnest; at times a quiver as of flapping wings sped by, and Marjolin and\r\nCadine, nestling amidst all the plumage, often imagined that they were\r\nbeing carried aloft by one of those huge birds with outspread pinions\r\nthat one hears of in the fairy tales.\r\n\r\nAs time went on their childish affection took the inevitable turn.\r\nVeritable offsprings of Nature, knowing naught of social conventions\r\nand restraints, they loved one another in all innocence and\r\nguilelessness. They mated even as the birds of the air mate, even as\r\nyouth and maid mated in primeval times, because such is Nature\u2019s law.\r\nAt sixteen Cadine was a dusky town gipsy, greedy and sensual, whilst\r\nMarjolin, now eighteen, was a tall, strapping fellow, as handsome a\r\nyouth as could be met, but still with his mental faculties quite\r\nundeveloped. He had lived, indeed, a mere animal life, which had\r\nstrengthened his frame, but left his intellect in a rudimentary state.\r\n\r\nWhen old Madame Chantemesse realised the turn that things were taking\r\nshe wrathfully upbraided Cadine and struck out vigorously at her with\r\nher broom. But the hussy only laughed and dodged the blows, and then\r\nhied off to her lover. And gradually the markets became their home,\r\ntheir manger, their aviary, where they lived and loved amidst the meat,\r\nthe butter, the vegetables, and the feathers.\r\n\r\nThey discovered another little paradise in the pavilion where butter,\r\neggs, and cheese were sold wholesale. Enormous walls of empty baskets\r\nwere here piled up every morning, and amidst these Cadine and Marjolin\r\nburrowed and hollowed out a dark lair for themselves. A mere partition\r\nof osier-work separated them from the market crowd, whose loud voices\r\nrang out all around them. They often shook with laughter when people,\r\nwithout the least suspicion of their presence, stopped to talk together\r\na few yards away from them. On these occasions they would contrive\r\npeepholes, and spy through them, and when cherries were in season\r\nCadine tossed the stones in the faces of all the old women who passed\r\nalong\u2014a pastime which amused them the more as the startled old crones\r\ncould never make out whence the hail of cherry-stones had come. They\r\nalso prowled about the depths of the cellars, knowing every gloomy\r\ncorner of them, and contriving to get through the most carefully locked\r\ngates. One of their favourite amusements was to visit the track of the\r\nsubterranean railway, which had been laid under the markets, and which\r\nthose who planned the latter had intended to connect with the different\r\ngoods\u2019 stations of Paris. Sections of this railway were laid beneath\r\neach of the covered ways, between the cellars of each pavilion; the\r\nwork, indeed, was in such an advanced state that turn-tables had been\r\nput into position at all the points of intersection, and were in\r\nreadiness for use. After much examination, Cadine and Marjolin had at\r\nlast succeeded in discovering a loose plank in the hoarding which\r\nenclosed the track, and they had managed to convert it into a door, by\r\nwhich they could easily gain access to the line. There they were quite\r\nshut off from the world, though they could hear the continuous rumbling\r\nof the street traffic over their heads.\r\n\r\nThe line stretched through deserted vaults, here and there illumined by\r\na glimmer of light filtering through iron gratings, while in certain\r\ndark corners gas jets were burning. And Cadine and Marjolin rambled\r\nabout as in the secret recesses of some castle of their own, secure\r\nfrom all interruption, and rejoicing in the buzzy silence, the murky\r\nglimmer, and subterranean secrecy, which imparted a touch of melodrama\r\nto their experiences. All sorts of smells were wafted through the\r\nhoarding from the neighbouring cellars; the musty smell of vegetables,\r\nthe pungency of fish, the overpowering stench of cheese, and the warm\r\nreek of poultry.\r\n\r\nAt other times, on clear nights and fine dawns, they would climb on to\r\nthe roofs, ascending thither by the steep staircases of the turrets at\r\nthe angles of the pavilions. Up above they found fields of leads,\r\nendless promenades and squares, a stretch of undulating country which\r\nbelonged to them. They rambled round the square roofs of the pavilions,\r\nfollowed the course of the long roofs of the covered ways, climbed and\r\ndescended the slopes, and lost themselves in endless perambulations of\r\ndiscovery. And when they grew tired of the lower levels they ascended\r\nstill higher, venturing up the iron ladders, on which Cadine\u2019s skirts\r\nflapped like flags. Then they ran along the second tier of roofs\r\nbeneath the open heavens. There was nothing save the stars above them.\r\nAll sorts of sounds rose up from the echoing markets, a clattering and\r\nrumbling, a vague roar as of a distant tempest heard at nighttime. At\r\nthat height the morning breeze swept away the evil smells, the foul\r\nbreath of the awaking markets. They would kiss one another on the edge\r\nof the gutterings like sparrows frisking on the house-tops. The rising\r\nfires of the sun illumined their faces with a ruddy glow. Cadine\r\nlaughed with pleasure at being so high up in the air, and her neck\r\nshone with iridescent tints like a dove\u2019s; while Marjolin bent down to\r\nlook at the street still wrapped in gloom, with his hands clutching\r\nhold of the leads like the feet of a wood-pigeon. When they descended\r\nto earth again, joyful from their excursion in the fresh air, they\r\nwould remark to one another that they were coming back from the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt was in the tripe market that they had made the acquaintance of\r\nClaude Lantier. They went there every day, impelled thereto by an\r\nanimal taste for blood, the cruel instinct of urchins who find\r\namusement in the sight of severed heads. A ruddy stream flowed along\r\nthe gutters round the pavilion; they dipped the tips of their shoes in\r\nit, and dammed it up with leaves, so as to form large pools of blood.\r\nThey took a strong interest in the arrival of the loads of offal in\r\ncarts which always smelt offensively, despite all the drenchings of\r\nwater they got; they watched the unloading of the bundles of sheep\u2019s\r\ntrotters, which were piled up on the ground like filthy paving-stones,\r\nof the huge stiffened tongues, bleeding at their torn roots, and of the\r\nmassive bell-shaped bullocks\u2019 hearts. But the spectacle which, above\r\nall others, made them quiver with delight was that of the big dripping\r\nhampers, full of sheep\u2019s heads, with greasy horns and black muzzles,\r\nand strips of woolly skin dangling from bleeding flesh. The sight of\r\nthese conjured up in their minds the idea of some guillotine casting\r\ninto the baskets the heads of countless victims.\r\n\r\nThey followed the baskets into the depths of the cellar, watching them\r\nglide down the rails laid over the steps, and listening to the rasping\r\nnoise which the casters of these osier waggons made in their descent.\r\nDown below there was a scene of exquisite horror. They entered into a\r\ncharnel-house atmosphere, and walked along through murky puddles,\r\namidst which every now and then purple eyes seem to be glistening. At\r\ntimes the soles of their boots stuck to the ground, at others they\r\nsplashed through the horrible mire, anxious and yet delighted. The gas\r\njets burned low, like blinking, bloodshot eyes. Near the water-taps, in\r\nthe pale light falling through the gratings, they came upon the blocks;\r\nand there they remained in rapture watching the tripe men, who, in\r\naprons stiffened by gory splashings, broke the sheep\u2019s heads one after\r\nanother with a blow of their mallets. They lingered there for hours,\r\nwaiting till all the baskets were empty, fascinated by the crackling of\r\nthe bones, unable to tear themselves away till all was over. Sometimes\r\nan attendant passed behind them, cleansing the cellar with a hose;\r\nfloods of water rushed out with a sluice-like roar, but although the\r\nviolence of the discharge actually ate away the surface of the\r\nflagstones, it was powerless to remove the ruddy stains and stench of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nCadine and Marjolin were sure of meeting Claude between four and five\r\nin the afternoon at the wholesale auction of the bullocks\u2019 lights. He\r\nwas always there amidst the tripe dealers\u2019 carts backed up against the\r\nkerb-stones and the blue-bloused, white-aproned men who jostled him and\r\ndeafened his ears by their loud bids. But he never felt their elbows;\r\nhe stood in a sort of ecstatic trance before the huge hanging lights,\r\nand often told Cadine and Marjolin that there was no finer sight to be\r\nseen. The lights were of a soft rosy hue, gradually deepening and\r\nturning at the lower edges to a rich carmine; and Claude compared them\r\nto watered satin, finding no other term to describe the soft silkiness\r\nof those flowing lengths of flesh which drooped in broad folds like\r\nballet dancers\u2019 skirts. He thought, too, of gauze and lace allowing a\r\nglimpse of pinky skin; and when a ray of sunshine fell upon the lights\r\nand girdled them with gold an expression of languorous rapture came\r\ninto his eyes, and he felt happier than if he had been privileged to\r\ncontemplate the Greek goddesses in their sovereign nudity, or the\r\nchatelaines of romance in their brocaded robes.\r\n\r\nThe artist became a great friend of the two young scapegraces. He loved\r\nbeautiful animals, and such undoubtedly they were. For a long time he\r\ndreamt of a colossal picture which should represent the loves of Cadine\r\nand Marjolin in the central markets, amidst the vegetables, the fish,\r\nand the meat. He would have depicted them seated on some couch of food,\r\ntheir arms circling each other\u2019s waists, and their lips exchanging an\r\nidyllic kiss. In this conception he saw a manifesto proclaiming the\r\npositivism of art\u2014modern art, experimental and materialistic. And it\r\nseemed to him also that it would be a smart satire on the school which\r\nwishes every painting to embody an \u201Cidea,\u201D a slap for the old\r\ntraditions and all they represented. But during a couple of years he\r\nbegan study after study without succeeding in giving the particular\r\n\u201Cnote\u201D he desired. In this way he spoilt fifteen canvases. His failure\r\nfilled him with rancour; however, he continued to associate with his\r\ntwo models from a sort of hopeless love for his abortive picture. When\r\nhe met them prowling about in the afternoon, he often scoured the\r\nneighbourhood with them, strolling around with his hands in his\r\npockets, and deeply interested in the life of the streets.\r\n\r\nThey all three trudged along together, dragging their heels over the\r\nfootways and monopolising their whole breadth so as to force others to\r\nstep down into the road. With their noses in the air they sniffed in\r\nthe odours of Paris, and could have recognised every corner blindfold\r\nby the spirituous emanations of the wine shops, the hot puffs that came\r\nfrom the bakehouses and confectioners\u2019, and the musty odours wafted\r\nfrom the fruiterers\u2019. They would make the circuit of the whole\r\ndistrict. They delighted in passing through the rotunda of the corn\r\nmarket, that huge massive stone cage where sacks of flour were piled up\r\non every side, and where their footsteps echoed in the silence of the\r\nresonant roof. They were fond, too, of the little narrow streets in the\r\nneighbourhood, which had become as deserted, as black, and as mournful\r\nas though they formed part of an abandoned city. These were the Rue\r\nBabille, the Rue Sauval, the Rue des Deux Ecus, and the Rue de Viarmes,\r\nthis last pallid from its proximity to the millers\u2019 stores, and at four\r\no\u2019clock lively by reason of the corn exchange held there. It was\r\ngenerally at this point that they started on their round. They made\r\ntheir way slowly along the Rue Vauvilliers, glancing as they went at\r\nthe windows of the low eating-houses, and thus reaching the miserably\r\nnarrow Rue des Prouvaires, where Claude blinked his eyes as he saw one\r\nof the covered ways of the market, at the far end of which, framed\r\nround by this huge iron nave, appeared a side entrance of St. Eustache\r\nwith its rose and its tiers of arched windows. And then, with an air of\r\ndefiance, he would remark that all the middle ages and the Renaissance\r\nput together were less mighty than the central markets. Afterwards, as\r\nthey paced the broad new streets, the Rue du Pont Neuf and the Rue des\r\nHalles, he explained modern life with its wide footways, its lofty\r\nhouses, and its luxurious shops, to the two urchins. He predicted, too,\r\nthe advent of new and truly original art, whose approach he could\r\ndivine, and despair filled him that its revelation should seemingly be\r\nbeyond his own powers.\r\n\r\nCadine and Marjolin, however, preferred the provincial quietness of the\r\nRue des Bourdonnais, where one can play at marbles without fear of\r\nbeing run over. The girl perked her head affectedly as she passed the\r\nwholesale glove and hosiery stores, at each door of which bareheaded\r\nassistants, with their pens stuck in their ears, stood watching her\r\nwith a weary gaze. And she and her lover had yet a stronger preference\r\nfor such bits of olden Paris as still existed: the Rue de la Poterie\r\nand the Rue de la Lingerie, with their butter and egg and cheese\r\ndealers; the Rue de la Ferronerie and the Rue de l\u2019Aiguillerie (the\r\nbeautiful streets of far-away times), with their dark narrow shops; and\r\nespecially the Rue Courtalon, a dank, dirty by-way running from the\r\nPlace Sainte Opportune to the Rue Saint Denis, and intersected by\r\nfoul-smelling alleys where they had romped in their younger days. In\r\nthe Rue Saint Denis they entered into the land of dainties; and they\r\nsmiled upon the dried apples, the \u201CSpanishwood,\u201D the prunes, and the\r\nsugar-candy in the windows of the grocers and druggists. Their\r\nramblings always set them dreaming of a feast of good things, and\r\ninspired them with a desire to glut themselves on the contents of the\r\nwindows. To them the district seemed like some huge table, always laid\r\nwith an everlasting dessert into which they longed to plunge their\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nThey devoted but a moment to visiting the other blocks of tumble-down\r\nold houses, the Rue Pirouette, the Rue de Mondetour, the Rue de la\r\nPetite Truanderie, and the Rue de la Grande Truanderie, for they took\r\nlittle interest in the shops of the dealers in edible snails, cooked\r\nvegetables, tripe, and drink. In the Rue de la Grand Truanderie,\r\nhowever, there was a soap factory, an oasis of sweetness in the midst\r\nof all the foul odours, and Marjolin was fond of standing outside it\r\ntill some one happened to enter or come out, so that the perfume which\r\nswept through the doorway might blow full in his face. Then with all\r\nspeed they returned to the Rue Pierre Lescot and the Rue Rambuteau.\r\nCadine was extremely fond of salted provisions; she stood in admiration\r\nbefore the bundles of red-herrings, the barrels of anchovies and\r\ncapers, and the little casks of gherkins and olives, standing on end\r\nwith wooden spoons inside them. The smell of the vinegar titillated her\r\nthroat; the pungent odour of the rolled cod, smoked salmon, bacon and\r\nham, and the sharp acidity of the baskets of lemons, made her mouth\r\nwater longingly. She was also fond of feasting her eyes on the boxes of\r\nsardines piled up in metallic columns amidst the cases and sacks. In\r\nthe Rue Montorgueil and the Rue Montmartre were other tempting-looking\r\ngroceries and restaurants, from whose basements appetising odours were\r\nwafted, with glorious shows of game and poultry, and\r\npreserved-provision shops, which last displayed beside their doors open\r\nkegs overflowing with yellow sour-krout suggestive of old lacework.\r\nThen they lingered in the Rue Coquilli\u00E8re, inhaling the odour of\r\ntruffles from the premises of a notable dealer in comestibles, which\r\nthrew so strong a perfume into the street that Cadine and Marjolin\r\nclosed their eyes and imagined they were swallowing all kinds of\r\ndelicious things. These perfumes, however, distressed Claude. They made\r\nhim realise the emptiness of his stomach, he said; and, leaving the\r\n\u201Ctwo animals\u201D to feast on the odour of the truffles\u2014the most\r\npenetrating odour to be found in all the neighbourhood\u2014he went off\r\nagain to the corn market by way of the Rue Oblin, studying on his road\r\nthe old women who sold green-stuff in the doorways and the displays of\r\ncheap pottery spread out on the foot-pavements.\r\n\r\nSuch were their rambles in common; but when Cadine set out alone with\r\nher bunches of violets she often went farther afield, making it a point\r\nto visit certain shops for which she had a particular partiality. She\r\nhad an especial weakness for the Taboureau bakery establishment, one of\r\nthe windows of which was exclusively devoted to pastry. She would\r\nfollow the Rue Turbigo and retrace her steps a dozen times in order to\r\npass again and again before the almond cakes, the _savarins_, the St.\r\nHonor\u00E9 tarts, the fruit tarts, and the various dishes containing\r\nbunlike _babas_ redolent of rum, eclairs combining the finger biscuit\r\nwith chocolate, and _choux a la cr\u00E8me_, little rounds of pastry\r\noverflowing with whipped white of egg. The glass jars full of dry\r\nbiscuits, macaroons, and _madeleines_ also made her mouth water; and\r\nthe bright shop with its big mirrors, its marble slabs, its gilding,\r\nits bread-bins of ornamental ironwork, and its second window in which\r\nlong glistening loaves were displayed slantwise, with one end resting\r\non a crystal shelf whilst above they were upheld by a brass rod, was so\r\nwarm and odoriferous of baked dough that her features expanded with\r\npleasure when, yielding to temptation, she went in to buy a _brioche_\r\nfor two sous.\r\n\r\nAnother shop, one in front of the Square des Innocents, also filled her\r\nwith gluttonous inquisitiveness, a fever of longing desire. This shop\r\nmade a specialty of forcemeat pasties. In addition to the ordinary ones\r\nthere were pasties of pike and pasties of truffled _foie gras_; and the\r\ngirl would gaze yearningly at them, saying to herself that she would\r\nreally have to eat one some day.\r\n\r\nCadine also had her moments of vanity and coquetry. When these fits\r\nwere on her, she bought herself in imagination some of the magnificent\r\ndresses displayed in the windows of the \u201CFabriques de France\u201D which\r\nmade the Pointe Saint Eustache gaudy with their pieces of bright stuff\r\nhanging from the first floor to the footway and flapping in the breeze.\r\nSomewhat incommoded by the flat basket hanging before her, amidst the\r\ncrowd of market women in dirty aprons gazing at future Sunday dresses,\r\nthe girl would feel the woollens, flannels, and cottons to test the\r\ntexture and suppleness of the material; and she would promise herself a\r\ngown of bright-coloured flannelling, flowered print, or scarlet poplin.\r\nSometimes even from amongst the pieces draped and set off to advantage\r\nby the window-dressers she would choose some soft sky-blue or\r\napple-green silk, and dream of wearing it with pink ribbons. In the\r\nevenings she would dazzle herself with the displays in the windows of\r\nthe big jewellers in the Rue Montmartre. That terrible street deafened\r\nher with its ceaseless flow of vehicles, and the streaming crowd never\r\nceased to jostle her; still she did not stir, but remained feasting her\r\neyes on the blazing splendour set out in the light of the reflecting\r\nlamps which hung outside the windows. On one side all was white with\r\nthe bright glitter of silver: watches in rows, chains hanging, spoons\r\nand forks laid crossways, cups, snuff-boxes, napkin-rings, and combs\r\narranged on shelves. The silver thimbles, dotting a porcelain stand\r\ncovered with a glass shade, had an especial attraction for her. Then on\r\nthe other side the windows glistened with the tawny glow of gold. A\r\ncascade of long pendant chains descended from above, rippling with\r\nruddy gleams; small ladies\u2019 watches, with the backs of their cases\r\ndisplayed, sparkled like fallen stars; wedding rings clustered round\r\nslender rods; bracelets, broaches, and other costly ornaments glittered\r\non the black velvet linings of their cases; jewelled rings set their\r\nstands aglow with blue, green, yellow, and violet flamelets; while on\r\nevery tier of the shelves superposed rows of earrings and crosses and\r\nlockets hung against the crystal like the rich fringes of altar-cloths.\r\nThe glow of this gold illumined the street half way across with a\r\nsun-like radiance. And Cadine, as she gazed at it, almost fancied that\r\nshe was in presence of something holy, or on the threshold of the\r\nEmperor\u2019s treasure chamber. She would for a long time scrutinise all\r\nthis show of gaudy jewellery, adapted to the taste of the fish-wives,\r\nand carefully read the large figures on the tickets affixed to each\r\narticle; and eventually she would select for herself a pair of\r\nearrings\u2014pear-shaped drops of imitation coral hanging from golden\r\nroses.\r\n\r\nOne morning Claude caught her standing in ecstasy before a\r\nhair-dresser\u2019s window in the Rue Saint Honor\u00E9. She was gazing at the\r\ndisplay of hair with an expression of intense envy. High up in the\r\nwindow was a streaming cascade of long manes, soft wisps, loose\r\ntresses, frizzy falls, undulating comb-curls, a perfect cataract of\r\nsilky and bristling hair, real and artificial, now in coils of a\r\nflaming red, now in thick black crops, now in pale golden locks, and\r\neven in snowy white ones for the coquette of sixty. In cardboard boxes\r\ndown below were cleverly arranged fringes, curling side-ringlets, and\r\ncarefully combed chignons glossy with pomade. And amidst this\r\nframework, in a sort of shrine beneath the ravelled ends of the hanging\r\nlocks, there revolved the bust of a woman, arrayed in a wrapper of\r\ncherry-coloured satin fastened between the breasts with a brass brooch.\r\nThe figure wore a lofty bridal coiffure picked out with sprigs of\r\norange blossom, and smiled with a dollish smile. Its eyes were pale\r\nblue; its eyebrows were very stiff and of exaggerated length; and its\r\nwaxen cheeks and shoulders bore evident traces of the heat and smoke of\r\nthe gas. Cadine waited till the revolving figure again displayed its\r\nsmiling face, and as its profile showed more distinctly and it slowly\r\nwent round from left to right she felt perfectly happy. Claude,\r\nhowever, was indignant, and, shaking Cadine, he asked her what she was\r\ndoing in front of \u201Cthat abomination, that corpse-like hussy picked up\r\nat the Morgue!\u201D He flew into a temper with the \u201Cdummy\u2019s\u201D cadaverous\r\nface and shoulders, that disfigurement of the beautiful, and remarked\r\nthat artists painted nothing but that unreal type of woman nowadays.\r\nCadine, however, remained unconvinced by his oratory, and considered\r\nthe lady extremely beautiful. Then, resisting the attempts of the\r\nartist to drag her away by the arm, and scratching her black mop in\r\nvexation, she pointed to an enormous ruddy tail, severed from the\r\nquarters of some vigorous mare, and told him she would have liked to\r\nhave a crop of hair like that.\r\n\r\nDuring the long rambles when Claude, Cadine, and Marjolin prowled about\r\nthe neighbourhood of the markets, they saw the iron ribs of the giant\r\nbuilding at the end of every street. Wherever they turned they caught\r\nsudden glimpses of it; the horizon was always bounded by it; merely the\r\naspect under which it was seen varied. Claude was perpetually turning\r\nround, and particularly in the Rue Montmartre, after passing the\r\nchurch. From that point the markets, seen obliquely in the distance,\r\nfilled him with enthusiasm. A huge arcade, a giant, gaping gateway, was\r\nopen before him; then came the crowding pavilions with their lower and\r\nupper roofs, their countless Venetian shutters and endless blinds, a\r\nvision, as it were, of superposed houses and palaces; a Babylon of\r\nmetal of Hindoo delicacy of workmanship, intersected by hanging\r\nterraces, aerial galleries, and flying bridges poised over space. The\r\ntrio always returned to this city round which they strolled, unable to\r\nstray more than a hundred yards away. They came back to it during the\r\nhot afternoons when the Venetian shutters were closed and the blinds\r\nlowered. In the covered ways all seemed to be asleep, the ashy greyness\r\nwas streaked by yellow bars of sunlight falling through the high\r\nwindows. Only a subdued murmur broke the silence; the steps of a few\r\nhurrying passers-by resounded on the footways; whilst the badge-wearing\r\nporters sat in rows on the stone ledges at the corners of the\r\npavilions, taking off their boots and nursing their aching feet. The\r\nquietude was that of a colossus at rest, interrupted at times by some\r\ncock-crow rising from the cellars below.\r\n\r\nClaude, Cadine, and Marjolin then often went to see the empty hampers\r\npiled upon the drays, which came to fetch them every afternoon so that\r\nthey might be sent back to the consignors. There were mountains of\r\nthem, labelled with black letters and figures, in front of the\r\nsalesmen\u2019s warehouses in the Rue Berger. The porters arranged them\r\nsymmetrically, tier by tier, on the vehicles. When the pile rose,\r\nhowever, to the height of a first floor, the porter who stood below\r\nbalancing the next batch of hampers had to make a spring in order to\r\ntoss them up to his mate, who was perched aloft with arms extended.\r\nClaude, who delighted in feats of strength and dexterity, would stand\r\nfor hours watching the flight of these masses of osier, and would burst\r\ninto a hearty laugh whenever too vigorous a toss sent them flying over\r\nthe pile into the roadway beyond. He was fond, too, of the footways of\r\nthe Rue Rambuteau and the Rue du Pont Neuf, near the fruit market,\r\nwhere the retail dealers congregated. The sight of the vegetables\r\ndisplayed in the open air, on trestle-tables covered with damp black\r\nrags, was full of charm for him. At four in the afternoon the whole of\r\nthis nook of greenery was aglow with sunshine; and Claude wandered\r\nbetween the stalls, inspecting the bright-coloured heads of the\r\nsaleswomen with keen artistic relish. The younger ones, with their hair\r\nin nets, had already lost all freshness of complexion through the rough\r\nlife they led; while the older ones were bent and shrivelled, with\r\nwrinkled, flaring faces showing under the yellow kerchiefs bound round\r\ntheir heads. Cadine and Marjolin refused to accompany him hither, as\r\nthey could perceive old Mother Chantemesse shaking her fist at them, in\r\nher anger at seeing them prowling about together. He joined them again,\r\nhowever, on the opposite footway, where he found a splendid subject for\r\na picture in the stallkeepers squatting under their huge umbrellas of\r\nfaded red, blue, and violet, which, mounted upon poles, filled the\r\nwhole market-side with bumps, and showed conspicuously against the\r\nfiery glow of the sinking sun, whose rays faded amidst the carrots and\r\nthe turnips. One tattered harridan, a century old, was sheltering three\r\nspare-looking lettuces beneath an umbrella of pink silk, shockingly\r\nsplit and stained.\r\n\r\nCadine and Marjolin had struck up an acquaintance with Leon, Quenu\u2019s\r\napprentice, one day when he was taking a pie to a house in the\r\nneighbourhood. They saw him cautiously raise the lid of his pan in a\r\nsecluded corner of the Rue de Mondetour, and delicately take out a ball\r\nof forcemeat. They smiled at the sight, which gave them a very high\r\nopinion of Leon. And the idea came to Cadine that she might at last\r\nsatisfy one of her most ardent longings. Indeed, the very next time\r\nthat she met the lad with his basket she made herself very agreeable,\r\nand induced him to offer her a forcemeat ball. But, although she\r\nlaughed and licked her fingers, she experienced some disappointment.\r\nThe forcemeat did not prove nearly so nice as she had anticipated. On\r\nthe other hand, the lad, with his sly, greedy phiz and his white\r\ngarments, which made him look like a girl going to her first communion,\r\nsomewhat took her fancy.\r\n\r\nShe invited him to a monster lunch which she gave amongst the hampers\r\nin the auction room at the butter market. The three of them\u2014herself,\r\nMarjolin, and Leon\u2014completely secluded themselves from the world within\r\nfour walls of osier. The feast was laid out on a large flat basket.\r\nThere were pears, nuts, cream-cheese, shrimps, fried potatoes, and\r\nradishes. The cheese came from a fruiterer\u2019s in the Rue de la\r\nCossonnerie, and was a present; and a \u201Cfrier\u201D of the Rue de la Grande\r\nTruanderie had given Cadine credit for two sous\u2019 worth of potatoes. The\r\nrest of the feast, the pears, the nuts, the shrimps, and the radishes,\r\nhad been pilfered from different parts of the market. It was a\r\ndelicious treat; and Leon, desirous of returning the hospitality, gave\r\na supper in his bedroom at one o\u2019clock in the morning. The bill of fare\r\nincluded cold black-pudding, slices of polony, a piece of salt pork,\r\nsome gherkins, and some goose-fat. The Quenu-Gradelles\u2019 shop had\r\nprovided everything. And matters did not stop there. Dainty suppers\r\nalternated with delicate luncheons, and invitation upon invitation.\r\nThree times a week there were banquets, either amidst the hampers or in\r\nLeon\u2019s garret, where Florent, on the nights when he lay awake, could\r\nhear a stifled sound of munching and rippling laughter until day began\r\nto break.\r\n\r\nThe loves of Cadine and Marjolin now took another turn. The youth\r\nplayed the gallant, and just as another might entertain his\r\n_innamorata_ at a champagne supper _en t\u00EAte \u00E0 t\u00EAte_ in a private room,\r\nhe led Cadine into some quiet corner of the market cellars to munch\r\napples or sprigs of celery. One day he stole a red-herring, which they\r\ndevoured with immense enjoyment on the roof of the fish market beside\r\nthe guttering. There was not a single shady nook in the whole place\r\nwhere they did not indulge in secret feasts. The district, with its\r\nrows of open shops full of fruit and cakes and preserves, was no longer\r\na closed paradise, in front of which they prowled with greedy, covetous\r\nappetites. As they passed the shops they now extended their hands and\r\npilfered a prune, a few cherries, or a bit of cod. They also\r\nprovisioned themselves at the markets, keeping a sharp look-out as they\r\nmade their way between the stalls, picking up everything that fell, and\r\noften assisting the fall by a push of their shoulders.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of all the marauding, some terrible scores had to be\r\nrun up with the \u201Cfrier\u201D of the Rue de la Grand Truanderie. This\r\n\u201Cfrier,\u201D whose shanty leaned against a tumble-down house, and was\r\npropped up by heavy joists, green with moss, made a display of boiled\r\nmussels lying in large earthenware bowls filled to the brim with clear\r\nwater; of dishes of little yellow dabs stiffened by too thick a coating\r\nof paste; of squares of tripe simmering in a pan; and of grilled\r\nherrings, black and charred, and so hard that if you tapped them they\r\nsounded like wood. On certain weeks Cadine owed the frier as much as\r\ntwenty sous, a crushing debt, which required the sale of an\r\nincalculable number of bunches of violets, for she could count upon no\r\nassistance from Marjolin. Moreover, she was bound to return Leon\u2019s\r\nhospitalities; and she even felt some little shame at never being able\r\nto offer him a scrap of meat. He himself had now taken to purloining\r\nentire hams. As a rule, he stowed everything away under his shirt; and\r\nat night when he reached his bedroom he drew from his bosom hunks of\r\npolony, slices of _pat\u00E9 de foie gras_, and bundles of pork rind. They\r\nhad to do without bread, and there was nothing to drink; but no matter.\r\nOne night Marjolin saw Leon kiss Cadine between two mouthfuls; however,\r\nhe only laughed. He could have smashed the little fellow with a blow\r\nfrom his fist, but he felt no jealousy in respect of Cadine. He treated\r\nher simply as a comrade with whom he had chummed for years.\r\n\r\nClaude never participated in these feasts. Having caught Cadine one day\r\nstealing a beet-root from a little hamper lined with hay, he had pulled\r\nher ears and given her a sound rating. These thieving propensities made\r\nher perfect as a ne\u2019er-do-well. However, in spite of himself, he could\r\nnot help feeling a sort of admiration for these sensual, pilfering,\r\ngreedy creatures, who preyed upon everything that lay about, feasting\r\noff the crumbs that fell from the giant\u2019s table.\r\n\r\nAt last Marjolin nominally took service under Gavard, happy in having\r\nnothing to do except to listen to his master\u2019s flow of talk, while\r\nCadine still continued to sell violets, quite accustomed by this time\r\nto old Mother Chantemesse\u2019s scoldings. They were still the same\r\nchildren as ever, giving way to their instincts and appetites without\r\nthe slightest shame\u2014they were the growth of the slimy pavements of the\r\nmarket district, where, even in fine weather, the mud remains black and\r\nsticky. However, as Cadine walked along the footways, mechanically\r\ntwisting her bunches of violets, she was sometimes disturbed by\r\ndisquieting reveries; and Marjolin, too, suffered from an uneasiness\r\nwhich he could not explain. He would occasionally leave the girl and\r\nmiss some ramble or feast in order to go and gaze at Madame Quenu\r\nthrough the windows of her pork shop. She was so handsome and plump and\r\nround that it did him good to look at her. As he stood gazing at her,\r\nhe felt full and satisfied, as though he had just eaten or drunk\r\nsomething extremely nice. And when he went off, a sort of hunger and\r\nthirst to see her again suddenly came upon him. This had been going on\r\nfor a couple of months. At first he had looked at her with the\r\nrespectful glance which he bestowed upon the shop-fronts of the grocers\r\nand provision dealers; but subsequently, when he and Cadine had taken\r\nto general pilfering, he began to regard her smooth cheeks much as he\r\nregarded the barrels of olives and boxes of dried apples.\r\n\r\nFor some time past Marjolin had seen handsome Lisa every day, in the\r\nmorning. She would pass Gavard\u2019s stall, and stop for a moment or two to\r\nchat with the poultry dealer. She now did her marketing herself, so\r\nthat she might be cheated as little as possible, she said. The truth,\r\nhowever, was that she wished to make Gavard speak out. In the pork shop\r\nhe was always distrustful, but at his stall he chatted and talked with\r\nthe utmost freedom. Now, Lisa had made up her mind to ascertain from\r\nhim exactly what took place in the little room at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s;\r\nfor she had no great confidence in her secret police office,\r\nMademoiselle Saget. In a short time she learnt from the incorrigible\r\nchatterbox a lot of vague details which very much alarmed her. Two days\r\nafter her explanation with Quenu she returned home from the market\r\nlooking very pale. She beckoned to her husband to follow her into the\r\ndining-room, and having carefully closed the door she said to him: \u201CIs\r\nyour brother determined to send us to the scaffold, then? Why did you\r\nconceal from me what you knew?\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu declared that he knew nothing. He even swore a great oath that he\r\nhad not returned to Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, and would never go there again.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou will do well not to do so,\u201D replied Lisa, shrugging her shoulders,\r\n\u201Cunless you want to get yourself into a serious scrape. Florent is up\r\nto some evil trick, I\u2019m certain of it! I have just learned quite\r\nsufficient to show me where he is going. He\u2019s going back to Cayenne, do\r\nyou hear?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, after a pause, she continued in calmer ones: \u201COh, the unhappy\r\nman! He had everything here that he could wish for. He might have\r\nredeemed his character; he had nothing but good examples before him.\r\nBut no, it is in his blood! He will come to a violent end with his\r\npolitics! I insist upon there being an end to all this! You hear me,\r\nQuenu? I gave you due warning long ago!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe spoke the last words very incisively. Quenu bent his head, as if\r\nawaiting sentence.\r\n\r\n\u201CTo begin with,\u201D continued Lisa, \u201Che shall cease to take his meals\r\nhere. It will be quite sufficient if we give him a bed. He is earning\r\nmoney; let him feed himself.\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu seemed on the point of protesting, but his wife silenced him by\r\nadding energetically:\r\n\r\n\u201CMake your choice between him and me. If he remains here, I swear to\r\nyou that I will go away, and take my daughter with me. Do you want me\r\nto tell you the whole truth about him? He is a man capable of anything;\r\nhe has come here to bring discord into our household. But I will set\r\nthings right, you may depend on it. You have your choice between him\r\nand me; you hear me?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, leaving her husband in silent consternation, she returned to the\r\nshop, where she served a customer with her usual affable smile. The\r\nfact was that, having artfully inveigled Gavard into a political\r\ndiscussion, the poultry dealer had told her that she would soon see how\r\nthe land lay, that they were going to make a clean sweep of everything,\r\nand that two determined men like her brother-in-law and himself would\r\nsuffice to set the fire blazing. This was the evil trick of which she\r\nhad spoken to Quenu, some conspiracy to which Gavard was always making\r\nmysterious allusions with a sniggering grin from which he seemingly\r\ndesired a great deal to be inferred. And in imagination Lisa already\r\nsaw the gendarmes invading the pork shop, gagging herself, her husband,\r\nand Pauline, and casting them into some underground dungeon.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, at dinner, she evinced an icy frigidity. She made no\r\noffers to serve Florent, but several times remarked: \u201CIt\u2019s very strange\r\nwhat an amount of bread we\u2019ve got through lately.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent at last understood. He felt that he was being treated like a\r\npoor relation who is gradually turned out of doors. For the last two\r\nmonths Lisa had dressed him in Quenu\u2019s old trousers and coats; and, as\r\nhe was as thin as his brother was fat, these ragged garments had a most\r\nextraordinary appearance upon him. She also turned her oldest linen\r\nover to him: pocket-handkerchiefs which had been darned a score of\r\ntimes, ragged towels, sheets which were only fit to be cut up into\r\ndusters and dish-cloths, and worn-out shirts, distended by Quenu\u2019s\r\ncorpulent figure, and so short that they would have served Florent as\r\nunder-vests. Moreover, he no longer found around him the same\r\ngood-natured kindliness as in the earlier days. The whole household\r\nseemed to shrug its shoulders after the example set by handsome Lisa.\r\nAuguste and Augustine turned their backs upon him, and little Pauline,\r\nwith the cruel frankness of childhood, let fall some bitter remarks\r\nabout the stains on his coat and the holes in his shirt. However,\r\nduring the last days he suffered most at table. He scarcely dared to\r\neat, as he saw the mother and daughter fix their gaze upon him whenever\r\nhe cut himself a piece of bread. Quenu meantime peered into his plate,\r\nto avoid having to take any part in what went on.\r\n\r\nThat which most tortured Florent was his inability to invent a reason\r\nfor leaving the house. During a week he kept on revolving in his mind a\r\nsentence expressing his resolve to take his meals elsewhere, but could\r\nnot bring himself to utter it. Indeed, this man of tender nature lived\r\nin such a world of illusions that he feared he might hurt his brother\r\nand sister-in-law by ceasing to lunch and dine with them. It had taken\r\nhim over two months to detect Lisa\u2019s latent hostility; and even now he\r\nwas sometimes inclined to think that he must be mistaken, and that she\r\nwas in reality kindly disposed towards him. Unselfishness with him\r\nextended to forgetfulness of his requirements; it was no longer a\r\nvirtue, but utter indifference to self, an absolute obliteration of\r\npersonality. Even when he recognised that he was being gradually turned\r\nout of the house, his mind never for a moment dwelt upon his share in\r\nold Gradelle\u2019s fortune, or upon the accounts which Lisa had offered\r\nhim. He had already planned out his expenditure for the future;\r\nreckoning that with what Madame Verlaque still allowed him to retain of\r\nhis salary, and the thirty francs a month which a pupil, obtained\r\nthrough La Normande, paid him he would be able to spend eighteen sous\r\non his breakfast and twenty-six sous on his dinner. This, he thought,\r\nwould be ample. And so, at last, taking as his excuse the lessons which\r\nhe was giving his new pupil, he emboldened himself one morning to\r\npretend that it would be impossible for him in future to come to the\r\nhouse at mealtimes. He blushed as he gave utterance to this laboriously\r\nconstructed lie, which had given him so much trouble, and continued\r\napologetically:\r\n\r\n\u201CYou mustn\u2019t be offended; the boy only has those hours free. I can\r\neasily get something to eat, you know; and I will come and have a chat\r\nwith you in the evenings.\u201D\r\n\r\nBeautiful Lisa maintained her icy reserve, and this increased Florent\u2019s\r\nfeeling of trouble. In order to have no cause for self-reproach she had\r\nbeen unwilling to send him about his business, preferring to wait till\r\nhe should weary of the situation and go of his own accord. Now he was\r\ngoing, and it was a good riddance; and she studiously refrained from\r\nall show of kindliness for fear it might induce him to remain. Quenu,\r\nhowever, showed some signs of emotion, and exclaimed: \u201CDon\u2019t think of\r\nputting yourself about; take your meals elsewhere by all means, if it\r\nis more convenient. It isn\u2019t we who are turning you way; you\u2019ll at all\r\nevents dine with us sometimes on Sundays, eh?\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent hurried off. His heart was very heavy. When he had gone, the\r\nbeautiful Lisa did not venture to reproach her husband for his weakness\r\nin giving that invitation for Sundays. She had conquered, and again\r\nbreathed freely amongst the light oak of her dining-room, where she\r\nwould have liked to burn some sugar to drive away the odour of perverse\r\nleanness which seemed to linger about. Moreover, she continued to\r\nremain on the defensive; and at the end of another week she felt more\r\nalarmed than ever. She only occasionally saw Florent in the evenings,\r\nand began to have all sorts of dreadful thoughts, imagining that her\r\nbrother-in-law was constructing some infernal machine upstairs in\r\nAugustine\u2019s bedroom, or else making signals which would result in\r\nbarricades covering the whole neighbourhood. Gavard, who had become\r\ngloomy, merely nodded or shook his head when she spoke to him, and left\r\nhis stall for days together in Marjolin\u2019s charge. The beautiful Lisa,\r\nhowever, determined that she would get to the bottom of affairs. She\r\nknew that Florent had obtained a day\u2019s leave, and intended to spend it\r\nwith Claude Lantier, at Madame Francois\u2019s, at Nanterre. As he would\r\nstart in the morning, and remain away till night, she conceived the\r\nidea of inviting Gavard to dinner. He would be sure to talk freely, at\r\ntable, she thought. But throughout the morning she was unable to meet\r\nthe poultry dealer, and so in the afternoon she went back again to the\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nMarjolin was in the stall alone. He used to drowse there for hours,\r\nrecouping himself from the fatigue of his long rambles. He generally\r\nsat upon one chair with his legs resting upon another, and his head\r\nleaning against a little dresser. In the wintertime he took a keen\r\ndelight in lolling there and contemplating the display of game; the\r\nbucks hanging head downwards, with their fore-legs broken and twisted\r\nround their necks; the larks festooning the stall like garlands; the\r\nbig ruddy hares, the mottled partridges, the water-fowl of a\r\nbronze-grey hue, the Russian black cocks and hazel hens, which arrived\r\nin a packing of oat straw and charcoal;[*] and the pheasants, the\r\nmagnificent pheasants, with their scarlet hoods, their stomachers of\r\ngreen satin, their mantles of embossed gold, and their flaming tails,\r\nthat trailed like trains of court robes. All this show of plumage\r\nreminded Marjolin of his rambles in the cellars with Cadine amongst the\r\nhampers of feathers.\r\n\r\n[*] The baskets in which these are sent to Paris are identical with\r\nthose which in many provinces of Russia serve the _moujiks_ as cradles\r\nfor their infants.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the beautiful Lisa found Marjolin in the midst of the\r\npoultry. It was warm, and whiffs of hot air passed along the narrow\r\nalleys of the pavilion. She was obliged to stoop before she could see\r\nhim stretched out inside the stall, below the bare flesh of the birds.\r\nFrom the hooked bar up above hung fat geese, the hooks sticking in the\r\nbleeding wounds of their long stiffened necks, while their huge bodies\r\nbulged out, glowing ruddily beneath their fine down, and, with their\r\nsnowy tails and wings, suggesting nudity encompassed by fine linen. And\r\nalso hanging from the bar, with ears thrown back and feet parted as\r\nthough they were bent on some vigorous leap, were grey rabbits whose\r\nturned-up tails gleamed whitely, whilst their heads, with sharp teeth\r\nand dim eyes, laughed with the grin of death. On the counter of the\r\nstall plucked fowls showed their strained fleshy breasts; pigeons,\r\ncrowded on osier trays, displayed the soft bare skin of innocents;\r\nducks, with skin of rougher texture, exhibited their webbed feet; and\r\nthree magnificent turkeys, speckled with blue dots, like freshly-shaven\r\nchins, slumbered on their backs amidst the black fans of their expanded\r\ntails. On plates near by were giblets, livers, gizzards, necks, feet,\r\nand wings; while an oval dish contained a skinned and gutted rabbit,\r\nwith its four legs wide apart, its head bleeding, and is kidneys\r\nshowing through its gashed belly. A streamlet of dark blood, after\r\ntrickling along its back to its tail, had fallen drop by drop, staining\r\nthe whiteness of the dish. Marjolin had not even taken the trouble to\r\nwipe the block, near which the rabbit\u2019s feet were still lying. He\r\nreclined there with his eyes half closed, encompassed by other piles of\r\ndead poultry which crowded the shelves of the stall, poultry in paper\r\nwrappers like bouquets, rows upon rows of protuberant breasts and bent\r\nlegs showing confusedly. And amidst all this mass of food, the young\r\nfellow\u2019s big, fair figure, the flesh of his cheeks, hands, and powerful\r\nneck covered with ruddy down seemed as soft as that of the magnificent\r\nturkeys, and as plump as the breasts of the fat geese.\r\n\r\nWhen he caught sight of Lisa, he at once sprang up, blushing at having\r\nbeen caught sprawling in this way. He always seemed very nervous and\r\nill at ease in Madame Quenu\u2019s presence; and when she asked him if\r\nMonsieur Gavard was there, he stammered out: \u201CNo, I don\u2019t think so. He\r\nwas here a little while ago, but he want away again.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa looked at him, smiling; she had a great liking for him. But\r\nfeeling something warm brush against her hand, which was hanging by her\r\nside, she raised a little shriek. Some live rabbits were thrusting\r\ntheir noses out of a box under the counter of the stall, and sniffing\r\nat her skirts.\r\n\r\n\u201COh,\u201D she exclaimed with a laugh, \u201Cit\u2019s your rabbits that are tickling\r\nme.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she stooped and attempted to stroke a white rabbit, which darted\r\nin alarm into a corner of the box.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill Monsieur Gavard be back soon, do you think?\u201D she asked, as she\r\nagain rose erect.\r\n\r\nMarjolin once more replied that he did not know; then in a hesitating\r\nway he continued: \u201CHe\u2019s very likely gone down into the cellars. He told\r\nme, I think, that he was going there.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I think I\u2019ll wait for him, then,\u201D replied Lisa. \u201CCould you let\r\nhim know that I am here? or I might go down to him, perhaps. Yes,\r\nthat\u2019s a good idea; I\u2019ve been intending to go and have a look at the\r\ncellars for these last five years. You\u2019ll take me down, won\u2019t you, and\r\nexplain things to me?\u201D\r\n\r\nMarjolin blushed crimson, and, hurrying out of the stall, walked on in\r\nfront of her, leaving the poultry to look after itself. \u201COf course I\r\nwill,\u201D said he. \u201CI\u2019ll do anything you wish, Madame Lisa.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen they got down below, the beautiful Lisa felt quite suffocated by\r\nthe dank atmosphere of the cellar. She stood at the bottom step, and\r\nraised her eyes to look at the vaulted roofing of red and white bricks\r\narching slightly between the iron ribs upheld by small columns. What\r\nmade her hesitate more than the gloominess of the place was a warm,\r\npenetrating odour, the exhalations of large numbers of living\r\ncreatures, which irritated her nostrils and throat.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a nasty smell!\u201D she exclaimed. \u201CIt must be very unhealthy down\r\nhere.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt never does me any harm,\u201D replied Marjolin in astonishment. \u201CThere\u2019s\r\nnothing unpleasant about the smell when you\u2019ve got accustomed to it;\r\nand it\u2019s very warm and cosy down here in the wintertime.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs Lisa followed him, however, she declared that the strong scent of\r\nthe poultry quite turned her stomach, and that she would certainly not\r\nbe able to eat a fowl for the next two months. All around her, the\r\nstorerooms, the small cabins where the stallkeepers keep their live\r\nstock, formed regular streets, intersecting each other at right angles.\r\nThere were only a few scattered gas lights, and the little alleys\r\nseemed wrapped in sleep like the lanes of a village where the\r\ninhabitants have all gone to bed. Marjolin made Lisa feel the\r\nclose-meshed wiring, stretched on a framework of cast iron; and as she\r\nmade her way along one of the streets she amused herself by reading the\r\nnames of the different tenants, which were inscribed on blue labels.\r\n\r\n\u201CMonsieur Gavard\u2019s place is quite at the far end,\u201D said the young man,\r\nstill walking on.\r\n\r\nThey turned to the left, and found themselves in a sort of blind alley,\r\na dark, gloomy spot where not a ray of light penetrated. Gavard was not\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, it makes no difference,\u201D said Marjolin. \u201CI can show you our birds\r\njust the same. I have a key of the storeroom.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa followed him into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t suppose that I can see your birds in this black oven, do\r\nyou?\u201D she asked, laughing.\r\n\r\nMarjolin did not reply at once; but presently he stammered out that\r\nthere was always a candle in the storeroom. He was fumbling about the\r\nlock, and seemed quite unable to find the keyhole. As Lisa came up to\r\nhelp him, she felt a hot breath on her neck; and when the young man had\r\nat last succeeded in opening the door and lighted the candle, she saw\r\nthat he was trembling.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou silly fellow!\u201D she exclaimed, \u201Cto get yourself into such a state\r\njust because a door won\u2019t open! Why, you\u2019re no better than a girl, in\r\nspite of your big fists!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe stepped inside the storeroom. Gavard had rented two compartments,\r\nwhich he had thrown into one by removing the partition between them. In\r\nthe dirt on the floor wallowed the larger birds\u2014the geese, turkeys, and\r\nducks\u2014while up above, on tiers of shelves, were boxes with barred\r\nfronts containing fowls and rabbits. The grating of the storeroom was\r\nso coated with dust and cobwebs that it looked as though covered with\r\ngrey blinds. The woodwork down below was rotting, and covered with\r\nfilth. Lisa, however, not wishing to vex Marjolin, refrained from any\r\nfurther expression of disgust. She pushed her fingers between the bars\r\nof the boxes, and began to lament the fate of the unhappy fowls, which\r\nwere so closely huddled together and could not even stand upright. Then\r\nshe stroked a duck with a broken leg which was squatting in a corner,\r\nand the young man told her that it would be killed that very evening,\r\nfor fear lest it should die during the night.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut what do they do for food?\u201D asked Lisa.\r\n\r\nThereupon he explained to her that poultry would not eat in the dark,\r\nand that it was necessary to light a candle and wait there till they\r\nhad finished their meal.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt amuses me to watch them,\u201D he continued; \u201CI often stay here with a\r\nlight for hours altogether. You should see how they peck away; and when\r\nI hide the flame of the candle with my hand they all stand stock-still\r\nwith their necks in the air, just as though the sun had set. It is\r\nagainst the rules to leave a lighted candle here and go away. One of\r\nthe dealers, old Mother Palette\u2014you know her, don\u2019t you?\u2014nearly burned\r\nthe whole place down the other day. A fowl must have knocked the candle\r\nover into the straw while she was away.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA pretty thing, isn\u2019t it,\u201D said Lisa, \u201Cfor fowls to insist upon having\r\nthe chandeliers lighted up every time they take a meal?\u201D\r\n\r\nThis idea made her laugh. Then she came out of the storeroom, wiping\r\nher feet, and holding up her skirts to keep them from the filth.\r\nMarjolin blew out the candle and locked the door. Lisa felt rather\r\nnervous at finding herself in the dark again with this big young\r\nfellow, and so she hastened on in front.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m glad I came, all the same,\u201D she presently said, as he joined her.\r\n\u201CThere is a great deal more under these markets than I ever imagined.\r\nBut I must make haste now and get home again. They\u2019ll wonder what has\r\nbecome of me at the shop. If Monsieur Gavard comes back, tell him that\r\nI want to speak to him immediately.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI expect he\u2019s in the killing-room,\u201D said Marjolin. \u201CWe\u2019ll go and see,\r\nif you like.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa made no reply. She felt oppressed by the close atmosphere which\r\nwarmed her face. She was quite flushed, and her bodice, generally so\r\nstill and lifeless, began to heave. Moreover, the sound of Marjolin\u2019s\r\nhurrying steps behind her filled her with an uneasy feeling. At last\r\nshe stepped aside, and let him go on in front. The lanes of this\r\nunderground village were still fast asleep. Lisa noticed that her\r\ncompanion was taking the longest way. When they came out in front of\r\nthe railway track he told her that he had wished to show it to her; and\r\nthey stood for a moment or two looking through the chinks in the\r\nhoarding of heavy beams. Then Marjolin proposed to take her on to the\r\nline; but she refused, saying that it was not worth while, as she could\r\nsee things well enough where she was.\r\n\r\nAs they returned to the poultry cellars they found old Madame Palette\r\nin front of her storeroom, removing the cords of a large square hamper,\r\nin which a furious fluttering of wings and scraping of feet could be\r\nheard. As she unfastened the last knot the lid suddenly flew open, as\r\nthough shot up by a spring, and some big geese thrust out their heads\r\nand necks. Then, in wild alarm, they sprang from their prison and\r\nrushed away, craning their necks, and filling the dark cellars with a\r\nfrightful noise of hissing and clattering of beaks. Lisa could not help\r\nlaughing, in spite of the lamentations of the old woman, who swore like\r\na carter as she caught hold of two of the absconding birds and dragged\r\nthem back by the neck. Marjolin, meantime, set off in pursuit of a\r\nthird. They could hear him running along the narrow alleys, hunting for\r\nthe runaway, and delighting in the chase. Then, far off in the\r\ndistance, they heard the sounds of a struggle, and presently Marjolin\r\ncame back again, bringing the goose with him. Mother Palette, a\r\nsallow-faced old woman, took it in her arms and clasped it for a moment\r\nto her bosom, in the classic attitude of Leda.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, well, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what I should have done if you\r\nhadn\u2019t been here,\u201D said she. \u201CThe other day I had a regular fight with\r\none of the brutes; but I had my knife with me, and I cut its throat.\u201D\r\n\r\nMarjolin was quite out of breath. When they reached the stone blocks\r\nwhere the poultry were killed, and where the gas burnt more brightly,\r\nLisa could see that he was perspiring, and had bold, glistening eyes.\r\nShe thought he looked very handsome like that, with his broad\r\nshoulders, big flushed face, and fair curly hair, and she looked at him\r\nso complacently, with that air of admiration which women feel they may\r\nsafely express for quite young lads, that he relapsed into timid\r\nbashfulness again.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, Monsieur Gavard isn\u2019t here, you see,\u201D she said. \u201CYou\u2019ve only\r\nmade me waste my time.\u201D\r\n\r\nMarjolin, however, began rapidly explaining the killing of the poultry\r\nto her. Five huge stone slabs stretched out in the direction of the Rue\r\nRambuteau under the yellow light of the gas jets. A woman was killing\r\nfowls at one end; and this led him to tell Lisa that the birds were\r\nplucked almost before they were dead, the operation thus being much\r\neasier. Then he wanted her to feel the feathers which were lying in\r\nheaps on the stone slabs; and told her that they were sorted and sold\r\nfor as much as nine sous the pound, according to their quality. To\r\nsatisfy him, she was also obliged to plunge her hand into the big\r\nhampers full of down. Then he turned the water-taps, of which there was\r\none by every pillar. There was no end to the particulars he gave. The\r\nblood, he said, streamed along the stone blocks, and collected into\r\npools on the paved floor, which attendants sluiced with water every two\r\nhours, removing the more recent stains with coarse brushes.\r\n\r\nWhen Lisa stooped over the drain which carries away the swillings,\r\nMarjolin found a fresh text for talk. On rainy days, said he, the water\r\nsometimes rose through this orifice and flooded the place. It had once\r\nrisen a foot high; and they had been obliged to transport all the\r\npoultry to the other end of the cellar, which is on a higher level. He\r\nlaughed as he recalled the wild flutter of the terrified creatures.\r\nHowever, he had now finished, and it seemed as though there remained\r\nnothing else for him to show, when all at once he bethought himself of\r\nthe ventilator. Thereupon he took Lisa off to the far end of the\r\ncellar, and told her to look up; and inside one of the turrets at the\r\ncorner angles of the pavilion she observed a sort of escape-pipe, by\r\nwhich the foul atmosphere of the storerooms ascended into space.\r\n\r\nHere, in this corner, reeking with abominable odours, Marjolin\u2019s\r\nnostrils quivered, and his breath came and went violently. His long\r\nstroll with Lisa in these cellars, full of warm animal perfumes, had\r\ngradually intoxicated him.\r\n\r\nShe had again turned towards him. \u201CWell,\u201D said she, \u201Cit was very kind\r\nof you to show me all this, and when you come to the shop I will give\r\nyou something.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhilst speaking she took hold of his soft chin, as she often did,\r\nwithout recognising that he was no longer a child; and perhaps she\r\nallowed her hand to linger there a little longer than was her wont. At\r\nall events, Marjolin, usually so bashful, was thrilled by the caress,\r\nand all at once he impetuously sprang forward, clasped Lisa by the\r\nshoulders, and pressed his lips to her soft cheeks. She raised no cry,\r\nbut turned very pale at this sudden attack, which showed her how\r\nimprudent she had been. And then, freeing herself from the embrace, she\r\nraised her arm, as she had seen men do in slaughter houses, clenched\r\nher comely fist, and knocked Marjolin down with a single blow, planted\r\nstraight between his eyes; and as he fell his head came into collision\r\nwith one of the stone slabs, and was split open. Just at that moment\r\nthe hoarse and prolonged crowing of a cock sounded through the gloom.\r\n\r\nHandsome Lisa, however, remained perfectly cool. Her lips were tightly\r\ncompressed, and her bosom had recovered its wonted immobility. Up above\r\nshe could hear the heavy rumbling of the markets, and through the\r\nvent-holes alongside the Rue Rambuteau the noise of the street traffic\r\nmade its way into the oppressive silence of the cellar. Lisa reflected\r\nthat her own strong arm had saved her; and then, fearing lest some one\r\nshould come and find her there, she hastened off, without giving a\r\nglance at Marjolin. As she climbed the steps, after passing through the\r\ngrated entrance of the cellars, the daylight brought her great relief.\r\n\r\nShe returned to the shop, quite calm, and only looking a little pale.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve been a long time,\u201D Quenu said to her.\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t find Gavard. I have looked for him everywhere,\u201D she quietly\r\nreplied. \u201CWe shall have to eat our leg of mutton without him.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she filled the lard pot, which she noticed was empty; and cut some\r\npork chops for her friend Madame Taboureau, who had sent her little\r\nservant for them. The blows which she dealt with her cleaver reminded\r\nher of Marjolin. She felt that she had nothing to reproach herself\r\nwith. She had acted like an honest woman. She was not going to disturb\r\nher peace of mind; she was too happy to do anything to compromise\r\nherself. However, she glanced at Quenu, whose neck was coarse and\r\nruddy, and whose shaven chin looked as rough as knotted wood; whereas\r\nMarjolin\u2019s chin and neck resembled rosy satin. But then she must not\r\nthink of him any more, for he was no longer a child. She regretted it,\r\nand could not help thinking that children grew up much too quickly.\r\n\r\nA slight flush came back to her cheeks, and Quenu considered that she\r\nlooked wonderfully blooming. He came and sat down beside her at the\r\ncounter for a moment or two. \u201CYou ought to go out oftener,\u201D said he;\r\n\u201Cit does you good. We\u2019ll go to the theatre together one of these\r\nnights, if you like; to the Gait\u00E9, eh? Madame Taboureau has been to see\r\nthe piece they are playing there, and she declares it\u2019s splendid.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa smiled, and said they would see about it, and then once more she\r\ntook herself off. Quenu thought that it was too good of her to take so\r\nmuch trouble in running about after that brute Gavard. In point of\r\nfact, however, she had simply gone upstairs to Florent\u2019s bedroom, the\r\nkey of which was hanging from a nail in the kitchen. She hoped to find\r\nout something or other by an inspection of this room, since the poultry\r\ndealer had failed her. She went slowly round it, examining the bed, the\r\nmantelpiece, and every corner. The window with the little balcony was\r\nopen, and the budding pomegranate was steeped in the golden beams of\r\nthe setting sun. The room looked to her as though Augustine had never\r\nleft it\u2014had slept there only the night before. There seemed to be\r\nnothing masculine about the place. She was quite surprised, for she had\r\nexpected to find some suspicious-looking chests, and coffers with\r\nstrong locks. She went to feel Augustine\u2019s summer gown, which was still\r\nhanging against the wall. Then she sat down at the table, and began to\r\nread an unfinished page of manuscript, in which the word \u201Crevolution\u201D\r\noccurred twice. This alarmed her, and she opened the drawer, which she\r\nsaw was full of papers. But her sense of honour awoke within her in\r\npresence of the secret which the rickety deal table so badly guarded.\r\nShe remained bending over the papers, trying to understand them without\r\ntouching them, in a state of great emotion, when the shrill song of the\r\nchaffinch, on whose cage streamed a ray of sunshine, made her start.\r\nShe closed the drawer. It was a base thing that she had contemplated,\r\nshe thought.\r\n\r\nThen, as she lingered by the window, reflecting that she ought to go\r\nand ask counsel of Abb\u00E9 Roustan, who was a very sensible man, she saw a\r\ncrowd of people round a stretcher in the market square below. The night\r\nwas falling, still she distinctly recognised Cadine weeping in the\r\nmidst of the crowd; while Florent and Claude, whose boots were white\r\nwith dust, stood together talking earnestly at the edge of the footway.\r\nShe hurried downstairs again, surprised to see them back so soon, and\r\nscarcely had she reached her counter when Mademoiselle Saget entered\r\nthe shop.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey have found that scamp of a Marjolin in the cellar, with his head\r\nsplit open,\u201D exclaimed the old maid. \u201CWon\u2019t you come to see him, Madame\r\nQuenu?\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa crossed the road to look at him. The young fellow was lying on his\r\nback on the stretcher, looking very pale. His eyes were closed, and a\r\nstiff wisp of his fair hair was clotted with blood. The bystanders,\r\nhowever, declared that there was no serious harm done, and, besides,\r\nthe scamp had only himself to blame, for he was always playing all\r\nsorts of wild pranks in the cellars. It was generally supposed that he\r\nhad been trying to jump over one of the stone blocks\u2014one of his\r\nfavourite amusements\u2014and had fallen with his head against the slab.\r\n\r\n\u201CI dare say that hussy there gave him a shove,\u201D remarked Mademoiselle\r\nSaget, pointing to Cadine, who was weeping. \u201CThey are always larking\r\ntogether.\u201D\r\n\r\nMeantime the fresh air had restored Marjolin to consciousness, and he\r\nopened his eyes in wide astonishment. He looked round at everybody, and\r\nthen, observing Lisa bending over him, he gently smiled at her with an\r\nexpression of mingled humility and affection. He seemed to have\r\nforgotten all that had happened. Lisa, feeling relieved, said that he\r\nought to be taken to the hospital at once, and promised to go and see\r\nhim there, and take him some oranges and biscuits. However, Marjolin\u2019s\r\nhead had fallen back, and when the stretcher was carried away Cadine\r\nfollowed it, with her flat basket slung round her neck, and her hot\r\ntears rolling down upon the bunches of violets in their mossy bed. She\r\ncertainly had no thoughts for the flowers that she was thus scalding\r\nwith her bitter grief.\r\n\r\nAs Lisa went back to her shop, she heard Claude say, as he shook hands\r\nwith Florent and parted from him: \u201CAh! the confounded young scamp! He\u2019s\r\nquite spoiled my day for me! Still, we had a very enjoyable time,\r\ndidn\u2019t we?\u201D\r\n\r\nClaude and Florent had returned both worried and happy, bringing with\r\nthem the pleasant freshness of the country air. Madame Francois had\r\ndisposed of all her vegetables that morning before daylight; and they\r\nhad all three gone to the Golden Compasses, in the Rue Montorgueil, to\r\nget the cart. Here, in the middle of Paris, they found a foretaste of\r\nthe country. Behind the Restaurant Philippe, with its frontage of gilt\r\nwoodwork rising to the first floor, there was a yard like that of a\r\nfarm, dirty, teeming with life, reeking with the odour of manure and\r\nstraw. Bands of fowls were pecking at the soft ground. Sheds and\r\nstaircases and galleries of greeny wood clung to the old houses around,\r\nand at the far end, in a shanty of big beams, was Balthazar, harnessed\r\nto the cart, and eating the oats in his nosebag. He went down the Rue\r\nMontorgueil at a slow trot, seemingly well pleased to return to\r\nNanterre so soon. However, he was not going home without a load. Madame\r\nFrancois had a contract with the company which undertook the scavenging\r\nof the markets, and twice a week she carried off with her a load of\r\nleaves, forked up from the mass of refuse which littered the square. It\r\nmade excellent manure. In a few minutes the cart was filled to\r\noverflowing. Claude and Florent stretched themselves out on the deep\r\nbed of greenery; Madame Francois grasped her reins, and Balthazar went\r\noff at his slow, steady pace, his head somewhat bent by reason of there\r\nbeing so many passengers to pull along.\r\n\r\nThis excursion had been talked of for a long time past. Madame Francois\r\nlaughed cheerily. She was partial to the two men, and promised them an\r\n_omelette au lard_ as had never been eaten, said she, in \u201Cthat\r\nvillainous Paris.\u201D Florent and Claude revelled in the thought of this\r\nday of lounging idleness which as yet had scarcely begun to dawn.\r\nNanterre seemed to be some distant paradise into which they would\r\npresently enter.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you quite comfortable?\u201D Madame Francois asked as the cart turned\r\ninto the Rue du Pont Neuf.\r\n\r\nClaude declared that their couch was as soft as a bridal bed. Lying on\r\ntheir backs, with their hands crossed under their heads, both men were\r\nlooking up at the pale sky from which the stars were vanishing. All\r\nalong the Rue de Rivoli they kept unbroken silence, waiting till they\r\nshould have got clear of the houses, and listening to the worthy woman\r\nas she chattered to Balthazar: \u201CTake your time, old man,\u201D she said to\r\nhim in kindly tones. \u201CWe\u2019re in no hurry; we shall be sure to get there\r\nat last.\u201D\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Champs Elysees, when the artist saw nothing but\r\ntree-tops on either side of him, and the great green mass of the\r\nTuileries gardens in the distance, he woke up, as it were, and began to\r\ntalk. When the cart had passed the end of the Rue du Roule he had\r\ncaught a glimpse of the side entrance of Saint Eustache under the giant\r\nroofing of one of the market covered-ways. He was constantly referring\r\nto this view of the church, and tried to give it a symbolical meaning.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s an odd mixture,\u201D he said, \u201Cthat bit of church framed round by an\r\navenue of cast iron. The one will kill the other; the iron will slay\r\nthe stone, and the time is not very far off. Do you believe in chance,\r\nFlorent? For my part, I don\u2019t think that it was any mere chance of\r\nposition that set a rose-window of Saint Eustache right in the middle\r\nof the central markets. No; there\u2019s a whole manifesto in it. It is\r\nmodern art, realism, naturalism\u2014whatever you like to call it\u2014that has\r\ngrown up and dominates ancient art. Don\u2019t you agree with me?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as Florent still kept silence, Claude continued: \u201CBesides, that\r\nchurch is a piece of bastard architecture, made up of the dying gasp of\r\nthe middle ages, and the first stammering of the Renaissance. Have you\r\nnoticed what sort of churches are built nowadays? They resemble all\r\nkinds of things\u2014libraries, observatories, pigeon-cotes, barracks; and\r\nsurely no one can imagine that the Deity dwells in such places. The\r\npious old builders are all dead and gone; and it would be better to\r\ncease erecting those hideous carcasses of stone, in which we have no\r\nbelief to enshrine. Since the beginning of the century there has only\r\nbeen one large original pile of buildings erected in Paris\u2014a pile in\r\naccordance with modern developments\u2014and that\u2019s the central markets. You\r\nhear me, Florent? Ah! they are a fine bit of building, though they but\r\nfaintly indicate what we shall see in the twentieth century! And so,\r\nyou see, Saint Eustache is done for! It stands there with its\r\nrose-windows, deserted by worshippers, while the markets spread out by\r\nits side and teem with noisy life. Yes! that\u2019s how I understand it all,\r\nmy friend.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! Monsieur Claude,\u201D said Madame Francois, laughing, \u201Cthe woman who\r\ncut your tongue-string certainly earned her money. Look at Balthazar\r\nlaying his ears back to listen to you. Come, come, get along,\r\nBalthazar!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe cart was slowly making its way up the incline. At this early hour\r\nof the morning the avenue, with its double lines of iron chairs on\r\neither pathway, and its lawns, dotted with flowerbeds and clumps of\r\nshrubbery, stretching away under the blue shadows of the trees, was\r\nquite deserted; however, at the Rond-Point a lady and gentleman on\r\nhorseback passed the cart at a gentle trot. Florent, who had made\r\nhimself a pillow with a bundle of cabbage-leaves, was still gazing at\r\nthe sky, in which a far-stretching rosy glow was appearing. Every now\r\nand then he would close his eyes, the better to enjoy the fresh breeze\r\nof the morning as it fanned his face. He was so happy to escape from\r\nthe markets, and travel on through the pure air, that he remained\r\nspeechless, and did not even listen to what was being said around him.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd then, too, what fine jokers are those fellows who imprison art in\r\na toy-box!\u201D resumed Claude, after a pause. \u201CThey are always repeating\r\nthe same idiotic words: \u2018You can\u2019t create art out of science,\u2019 says\r\none; \u2018Mechanical appliances kill poetry,\u2019 says another; and a pack of\r\nfools wail over the fate of the flowers, as though anybody wished the\r\nflowers any harm! I\u2019m sick of all such twaddle; I should like to answer\r\nall that snivelling with some work of open defiance. I should take a\r\npleasure in shocking those good people. Shall I tell you what was the\r\nfinest thing I ever produced since I first began to work, and the one\r\nwhich I recall with the greatest pleasure? It\u2019s quite a story. When I\r\nwas at my Aunt Lisa\u2019s on Christmas Eve last year that idiot of an\r\nAuguste, the assistant, was setting out the shop-window. Well, he quite\r\nirritated me by the weak, spiritless way in which he arranged the\r\ndisplay; and at last I requested him to take himself off, saying that I\r\nwould group the things myself in a proper manner. You see, I had plenty\r\nof bright colours to work with\u2014the red of the tongues, the yellow of\r\nthe hams, the blue of the paper shavings, the rosy pink of the things\r\nthat had been cut into, the green of the sprigs of heath, and the black\r\nof the black-puddings\u2014ah! a magnificent black, which I have never\r\nmanaged to produce on my palette. And naturally, the _crepine_, the\r\nsmall sausages, the chitterlings, and the crumbed trotters provided me\r\nwith delicate greys and browns. I produced a perfect work of art. I\r\ntook the dishes, the plates, the pans, and the jars, and arranged the\r\ndifferent colours; and I devised a wonderful picture of still life,\r\nwith subtle scales of tints leading up to brilliant flashes of colour.\r\nThe red tongues seemed to thrust themselves out like greedy flames, and\r\nthe black-puddings, surrounded by pale sausages, suggested a dark night\r\nfraught with terrible indigestion. I had produced, you see, a picture\r\nsymbolical of the gluttony of Christmas Eve, when people meet and\r\nsup\u2014the midnight feasting, the ravenous gorging of stomachs void and\r\nfaint after all the singing of hymns.[*] At the top of everything a\r\nhuge turkey exhibited its white breast, marbled blackly by the truffles\r\nshowing through its skin. It was something barbaric and superb,\r\nsuggesting a paunch amidst a halo of glory; but there was such a\r\ncutting, sarcastic touch about it all that people crowded to the\r\nwindow, alarmed by the fierce flare of the shop-front. When my aunt\r\nLisa came back from the kitchen she was quite frightened, and thought\r\nI\u2019d set the fat in the shop on fire; and she considered the appearance\r\nof the turkey so indelicate that she turned me out of the place while\r\nAuguste re-arranged the window after his own idiotic fashion. Such\r\nbrutes will never understand the language of a red splotch by the side\r\nof a grey one. Ah, well! that was my masterpiece. I have never done\r\nanything better.\u201D\r\n\r\n[*] An allusion to the \u201Cmidnight mass\u201D usually celebrated in Roman\r\nCatholic churches on Christmas Eve.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe relapsed into silence, smiling and dwelling with gratification on\r\nthis reminiscence. The cart had now reached the Arc de Triomphe, and\r\nstrong currents of air swept from the avenues across the expanse of\r\nopen ground. Florent sat up, and inhaled with zest the first odours of\r\ngrass wafted from the fortifications. He turned his back on Paris,\r\nanxious to behold the country in the distance. At the corner of the Rue\r\nde Longchamp, Madame Francois pointed out to him the spot where she had\r\npicked him up. This rendered him thoughtful, and he gazed at her as she\r\nsat there, so healthy-looking and serene, with her arms slightly\r\nextended so as to grasp the reins. She looked even handsomer than Lisa,\r\nwith her neckerchief tied over her head, her robust glow of health, and\r\nher brusque, kindly air. When she gave a slight cluck with her tongue,\r\nBalthazar pricked up his ears and rattled down the road at a quicker\r\npace.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Nanterre, the cart turned to the left into a narrow\r\nlane, skirted some blank walls, and finally came to a standstill at the\r\nend of a sort of blind alley. It was the end of the world, Madame\r\nFrancois used to say. The load of vegetable leaves now had to be\r\ndischarged. Claude and Florent would not hear of the journeyman\r\ngardener, who was planting lettuces, leaving his work, but armed\r\nthemselves with pitchforks and proceeded to toss the leaves into the\r\nmanure pit. This occupation afforded them much amusement. Claude had\r\nquite a liking for manure, since it symbolises the world and its life.\r\nThe strippings and parings of the vegetables, the scourings of the\r\nmarkets, the refuse that fell from that colossal table, remained full\r\nof life, and returned to the spot where the vegetables had previously\r\nsprouted, to warm and nourish fresh generations of cabbages, turnips,\r\nand carrots. They rose again in fertile crops, and once more went to\r\nspread themselves out upon the market square. Paris rotted everything,\r\nand returned everything to the soil, which never wearied of repairing\r\nthe ravages of death.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D exclaimed Claude, as he plied his fork for the last time, \u201Chere\u2019s\r\na cabbage-stalk that I\u2019m sure I recognise. It has grown up at least\r\nhalf a score of times in that corner yonder by the apricot tree.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis remark made Florent laugh. But he soon became grave again, and\r\nstrolled slowly through the kitchen garden, while Claude made a sketch\r\nof the stable, and Madame Francois got breakfast ready. The kitchen\r\ngarden was a long strip of ground, divided in the middle by a narrow\r\npath; it rose slightly, and at the top end, on raising the head, you\r\ncould perceive the low barracks of Mont Valerien. Green hedges\r\nseparated it from other plots of land, and these lofty walls of\r\nhawthorn fringed the horizon with a curtain of greenery in such wise\r\nthat of all the surrounding country Mont Valerien alone seemed to rise\r\ninquisitively on tip-toe in order to peer into Madame Francois\u2019s close.\r\nGreat peacefulness came from the countryside which could not be seen.\r\nAlong the kitchen garden, between the four hedges, the May sun shone\r\nwith a languid heat, a silence disturbed only by the buzzing of\r\ninsects, a somnolence suggestive of painless parturition. Every now and\r\nthen a faint cracking sound, a soft sigh, made one fancy that one could\r\nhear the vegetables sprout into being. The patches of spinach and\r\nsorrel, the borders of radishes, carrots, and turnips, the beds of\r\npotatoes and cabbages, spread out in even regularity, displaying their\r\ndark leaf-mould between their tufts of greenery. Farther away, the\r\ntrenched lettuces, onions, leeks, and celery, planted by line in long\r\nstraight rows, looked like soldiers on parade; while the peas and beans\r\nwere beginning to twine their slender tendrils round a forest of\r\nsticks, which, when June came, they would transform into a thick and\r\nverdant wood. There was not a weed to be seen. The garden resembled two\r\nparallel strips of carpet of a geometrical pattern of green on a\r\nreddish ground, which were carefully swept every morning. Borders of\r\nthyme grew like greyish fringe along each side of the pathway.\r\n\r\nFlorent paced backwards and forwards amidst the perfume of the thyme,\r\nwhich the sun was warming. He felt profoundly happy in the peacefulness\r\nand cleanliness of the garden. For nearly a year past he had only seen\r\nvegetables bruised and crushed by the jolting of the market-carts;\r\nvegetables torn up on the previous evening, and still bleeding. He\r\nrejoiced to find them at home, in peace in the dark mould, and sound in\r\nevery part. The cabbages had a bulky, prosperous appearance; the\r\ncarrots looked bright and gay; and the lettuces lounged in line with an\r\nair of careless indolence. And as he looked at them all, the markets\r\nwhich he had left behind him that morning seemed to him like a vast\r\nmortuary, an abode of death, where only corpses could be found, a\r\ncharnel-house reeking with foul smells and putrefaction. He slackened\r\nhis steps, and rested in that kitchen garden, as after a long\r\nperambulation amidst deafening noises and repulsive odours. The uproar\r\nand the sickening humidity of the fish market had departed from him;\r\nand he felt as though he were being born anew in the pure fresh air.\r\nClaude was right, he thought. The markets were a sphere of death. The\r\nsoil was the life, the eternal cradle, the health of the world.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe omelet\u2019s ready!\u201D suddenly cried Madame Francois.\r\n\r\nWhen they were all three seated round the table in the kitchen, with\r\nthe door thrown open to the sunshine, they ate their breakfast with\r\nsuch light-hearted gaiety that Madame Francois looked at Florent in\r\namazement, repeating between each mouthful: \u201CYou\u2019re quite altered.\r\nYou\u2019re ten years younger. It is that villainous Paris which makes you\r\nseem so gloomy. You\u2019ve got a little sunshine in your eyes now. Ah!\r\nthose big towns do one\u2019s health no good, you ought to come and live\r\nhere.\u201D\r\n\r\nClaude laughed, and retorted that Paris was a glorious place. He stuck\r\nup for it and all that belonged to it, even to its gutters; though at\r\nthe same time retaining a keen affection for the country.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Madame Francois and Florent found themselves alone at\r\nthe end of the garden, in a corner planted with a few fruit trees.\r\nSeated on the ground, they talked somewhat seriously together. The good\r\nwoman advised Florent with an affectionate and quite maternal kindness.\r\nShe asked him endless questions about his life, and his intentions for\r\nthe future, and begged him to remember that he might always count upon\r\nher, if ever he thought that she could in the slightest degree\r\ncontribute to his happiness. Florent was deeply touched. No woman had\r\never spoken to him in that way before. Madame Francois seemed to him\r\nlike some healthy, robust plant that had grown up with the vegetables\r\nin the leaf-mould of the garden; while the Lisas, the Normans, and\r\nother pretty women of the markets appeared to him like flesh of\r\ndoubtful freshness decked out for exhibition. He here enjoyed several\r\nhours of perfect well-being, delivered from all that reek of food which\r\nsickened him in the markets, and reviving to new life amidst the\r\nfertile atmosphere of the country, like that cabbage stalk which Claude\r\ndeclared he had seen sprout up more than half a score of times.\r\n\r\nThe two men took leave of Madame Francois at about five o\u2019clock. They\r\nhad decided to walk back to Paris; and the market gardener accompanied\r\nthem into the lane. As she bade good-bye to Florent, she kept his hand\r\nin her own for a moment, and said gently: \u201CIf ever anything happens to\r\ntrouble you, remember to come to me.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor a quarter of an hour Florent walked on without speaking, already\r\ngetting gloomy again, and reflecting that he was leaving health behind\r\nhim. The road to Courbevoie was white with dust. However, both men were\r\nfond of long walks and the ringing of stout boots on the hard ground.\r\nLittle clouds of dust rose up behind their heels at every step, while\r\nthe rays of the sinking sun darted obliquely over the avenue,\r\nlengthening their shadows in such wise that their heads reached the\r\nother side of the road, and journeyed along the opposite footway.\r\n\r\nClaude, swinging his arms, and taking long, regular strides,\r\ncomplacently watched these two shadows, whilst enjoying the rhythmical\r\ncadence of his steps, which he accentuated by a motion of his\r\nshoulders. Presently, however, as though just awaking from a dream, he\r\nexclaimed: \u201CDo you know the \u2018Battle of the Fat and the Thin\u2019?\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent, surprised by the question, replied in the negative; and\r\nthereupon Claude waxed enthusiastic, talking of that series of prints\r\nin very eulogical fashion. He mentioned certain incidents: the Fat, so\r\nswollen that they almost burst, preparing their evening debauch, while\r\nthe Thin, bent double by fasting, looked in from the street with the\r\nappearance of envious laths; and then, again, the Fat, with hanging\r\ncheeks, driving off one of the Thin, who had been audacious enough to\r\nintroduce himself into their midst in lowly humility, and who looked\r\nlike a ninepin amongst a population of balls.\r\n\r\nIn these designs Claude detected the entire drama of human life, and he\r\nended by classifying men into Fat and Thin, two hostile groups, one of\r\nwhich devours the other, and grows fat and sleek and enjoys itself.\r\n\r\n\u201CCain,\u201D said he, \u201Cwas certainly one of the Fat, and Abel one of the\r\nThin. Ever since that first murder, there have been rampant appetites\r\nwhich have drained the life-blood of small eaters. It\u2019s a continual\r\npreying of the stronger upon the weaker; each swallowing his neighbour,\r\nand then getting swallowed in his turn. Beware of the Fat, my friend.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe relapsed into silence for a moment, still watching their two\r\nshadows, which the setting sun elongated more than ever. Then he\r\nmurmured: \u201CYou see, we belong to the Thin\u2014you and I. Those who are no\r\nmore corpulent than we are don\u2019t take up much room in the sunlight,\r\neh?\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent glanced at the two shadows, and smiled. But Claude waxed angry,\r\nand exclaimed: \u201CYou make a mistake if you think it is a laughing\r\nmatter. For my own part, I greatly suffer from being one of the Thin.\r\nIf I were one of the Fat, I could paint at my ease; I should have a\r\nfine studio, and sell my pictures for their weight in gold. But,\r\ninstead of that, I\u2019m one of the Thin; and I have to grind my life out\r\nin producing things which simply make the Fat ones shrug their\r\nshoulders. I shall die of it all in the end, I\u2019m sure of it, with my\r\nskin clinging to my bones, and so flattened that they will be able to\r\nbury me between two leaves of a book. And you, too, you are one of the\r\nThin, a wonderful one; the very king of Thin, in fact! Do you remember\r\nyour quarrel with the fish-wives? It was magnificent; all those\r\ncolossal bosoms flying at your scraggy breast! Oh! they were simply\r\nacting from natural instinct; they were pursuing one of the Thin just\r\nas cats pursue a mouse. The Fat, you know, have an instinctive hatred\r\nof the Thin, to such an extent that they must needs drive the latter\r\nfrom their sight, either by means of their teeth or their feet. And\r\nthat is why, if I were in your place, I should take my precautions. The\r\nQuenus belong to the Fat, and so do the Mehudins; indeed, you have none\r\nbut Fat ones around you. I should feel uneasy under such\r\ncircumstances.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what about Gavard, and Mademoiselle Saget, and your friend\r\nMarjolin?\u201D asked Florent, still smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, if you like, I will classify all our acquaintances for you,\u201D\r\nreplied Claude. \u201CI\u2019ve had their heads in a portfolio in my studio for a\r\nlong time past, with memoranda of the order to which they belong.\r\nGavard is one of the Fat, but of the kind which pretends to belong to\r\nthe Thin. The variety is by no means uncommon. Mademoiselle Saget and\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur belong to the Thin, but to a variety which is much to be\r\nfeared\u2014the Thin ones whom envy drives to despair, and who are capable\r\nof anything in their craving to fatten themselves. My friend Marjolin,\r\nlittle Cadine, and La Sarriette are three Fat ones, still innocent,\r\nhowever, and having nothing but the guileless hunger of youth. I may\r\nremark that the Fat, so long as they\u2019ve not grown old, are charming\r\ncreatures. Monsieur Lebigre is one of the Fat\u2014don\u2019t you think so? As\r\nfor your political friends, Charvet, Clemence, Logre, and Lacaille,\r\nthey mostly belong to the Thin. I only except that big animal\r\nAlexandre, and that prodigy Robine, who has caused me a vast amount of\r\nannoyance.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe artist continued to talk in this strain from the Pont de Neuilly to\r\nthe Arc de Triomphe. He returned to some of those whom he had already\r\nmentioned, and completed their portraits with a few characteristic\r\ntouches. Logre, he said, was one of the Thin whose belly had been\r\nplaced between his shoulders. Beautiful Lisa was all stomach, and the\r\nbeautiful Norman all bosom. Mademoiselle Saget, in her earlier life,\r\nmust have certainly lost some opportunity to fatten herself, for she\r\ndetested the Fat, while, at the same time, she despised the Thin. As\r\nfor Gavard, he was compromising his position as one of the Fat, and\r\nwould end by becoming as flat as a bug.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what about Madame Francois?\u201D Florent asked.\r\n\r\nClaude seemed much embarrassed by this question. He cast about for an\r\nanswer, and at last stammered:\r\n\r\n\u201CMadame Francois, Madame Francois\u2014well, no, I really don\u2019t know; I\r\nnever thought about classifying her. But she\u2019s a dear good soul, and\r\nthat\u2019s quite sufficient. She\u2019s neither one of the Fat nor one of the\r\nThin!\u201D\r\n\r\nThey both laughed. They were now in front of the Arc de Triomphe. The\r\nsun, over by the hills of Suresnes, was so low on the horizon that\r\ntheir colossal shadows streaked the whiteness of the great structure\r\neven above the huge groups of statuary, like strokes made with a piece\r\nof charcoal. This increased Claude\u2019s merriment, he waved his arms and\r\nbent his body; and then, as he started on his way again, he said; \u201CDid\r\nyou notice\u2014just as the sun set our two heads shot up to the sky!\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Florent no longer smiled. Paris was grasping him again, that Paris\r\nwhich now frightened him so much, after having cost him so many tears\r\nat Cayenne. When he reached the markets night was falling, and there\r\nwas a suffocating smell. He bent his head as he once more returned to\r\nthe nightmare of endless food, whilst preserving the sweet yet sad\r\nrecollection of that day of bright health odorous with the perfume of\r\nthyme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAt about four o\u2019clock on the afternoon of the following day Lisa betook\r\nherself to Saint Eustache. For the short walk across the square she had\r\narrayed herself very seriously in a black silk gown and thick woollen\r\nshawl. The handsome Norman, who, from her stall in the fish market,\r\nwatched her till she vanished into the church porch, was quite amazed.\r\n\r\n\u201CHallo! So the fat thing\u2019s gone in for priests now, has she?\u201D she\r\nexclaimed, with a sneer. \u201CWell, a little holy water may do her good!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was mistaken in her surmises, however, for Lisa was not a devotee.\r\nShe did not observe the ordinances of the Church, but said that she did\r\nher best to lead an honest life, and that this was all that was\r\nnecessary. At the same time, however, she disliked to hear religion\r\nspoken ill of, and often silenced Gavard, who delighted in scandalous\r\nstories of priests and their doings. Talk of that sort seemed to her\r\naltogether improper. Everyone, in her opinion, should be allowed to\r\nbelieve as they pleased, and every scruple should be respected.\r\nBesides, the majority of the clergy were most estimable men. She knew\r\nAbb\u00E9 Roustan, of Saint Eustache\u2014a distinguished priest, a man of shrewd\r\nsense, and one, she thought, whose friendship might be safely relied\r\nupon. And she would wind up by explaining that religion was absolutely\r\nnecessary for the people; she looked upon it as a sort of police force\r\nthat helped to maintain order, and without which no government would be\r\npossible. When Gavard went too far on this subject and asserted that\r\nthe priests ought to be turned into the streets and have their shops\r\nshut up, Lisa, shrugged her shoulders and replied: \u201CA great deal of\r\ngood that would do! Why, before a month was over the people would be\r\nmurdering one another in the streets, and you would be compelled to\r\ninvent another God. That was just what happened in \u201893. You know very\r\nwell that I\u2019m not given to mixing with the priests, but for all that I\r\nsay that they are necessary, as we couldn\u2019t do without them.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd so when Lisa happened to enter a church she always manifested the\r\nutmost decorum. She had bought a handsome missal, which she never\r\nopened, for use when she was invited to a funeral or a wedding. She\r\nknelt and rose at the proper times, and made a point of conducting\r\nherself with all propriety. She assumed, indeed, what she considered a\r\nsort of official demeanour, such as all well-to-do folks, tradespeople,\r\nand house-owners ought to observe with regard to religion.\r\n\r\nAs she entered Saint Eustache that afternoon she let the double doors,\r\ncovered with green baize, faded and worn by the frequent touch of pious\r\nhands, close gently behind her. Then she dipped her fingers in the holy\r\nwater and crossed herself in the correct fashion. And afterwards, with\r\nhushed footsteps, she made her way to the chapel of Saint Agnes, where\r\ntwo kneeling women with their faces buried in their hands were waiting,\r\nwhilst the blue skirts of a third protruded from the confessional. Lisa\r\nseemed rather put out by the sight of these women, and, addressing a\r\nverger who happened to pass along, wearing a black skullcap and\r\ndragging his feet over the slabs, she inquired: \u201CIs this Monsieur\r\nl\u2019Abb\u00E9 Roustan\u2019s day for hearing confessions?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe verger replied that his reverence had only two more penitents\r\nwaiting, and that they would not detain him long, so that if Lisa would\r\ntake a chair her turn would speedily come. She thanked him, without\r\ntelling him that she had not come to confess; and, making up her mind\r\nto wait, she began to pace the church, going as far as the chief\r\nentrance, whence she gazed at the lofty, severe, bare nave stretching\r\nbetween the brightly coloured aisles. Raising her head a little, she\r\nexamined the high altar, which she considered too plain, having no\r\ntaste for the cold grandeur of stonework, but preferring the gilding\r\nand gaudy colouring of the side chapels. Those on the side of the Rue\r\ndu Jour looked greyish in the light which filtered through their dusty\r\nwindows, but on the side of the markets the sunset was lighting up the\r\nstained glass with lovely tints, limpid greens and yellows in\r\nparticular, which reminded Lisa of the bottle of liqueurs in front of\r\nMonsieur Lebigre\u2019s mirror. She came back by this side, which seemed to\r\nbe warmed by the glow of light, and took a passing interest in the\r\nreliquaries, altar ornaments, and paintings steeped in prismatic\r\nreflections. The church was empty, quivering with the silence that fell\r\nfrom its vaulted roofing. Here and there a woman\u2019s dress showed like a\r\ndark splotch amidst the vague yellow of the chairs; and a low buzzing\r\ncame from the closed confessionals. As Lisa again passed the chapel of\r\nSaint Agnes she saw the blue dress still kneeling at Abb\u00E9 Roustan\u2019s\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, if I\u2019d wanted to confess I could have said everything in ten\r\nseconds,\u201D she thought, proud of her irreproachable integrity.\r\n\r\nThen she went on to the end of the church. Behind the high altar, in\r\nthe gloom of a double row of pillars, is the chapel of the Blessed\r\nVirgin, damp and dark and silent. The dim stained windows only show the\r\nflowing crimson and violet robes of saints, which blaze like flames of\r\nmystic love in the solemn, silent adoration of the darkness. It is a\r\nweird, mysterious spot, like some crepuscular nook of paradise solely\r\nillumined by the gleaming stars of two tapers. The four brass lamps\r\nhanging from the roof remain unlighted, and are but faintly seen; on\r\nespying them you think of the golden censers which the angels swing\r\nbefore the throne of Mary. And kneeling on the chairs between the\r\npillars there are always women surrendering themselves languorously to\r\nthe dim spot\u2019s voluptuous charm.\r\n\r\nLisa stood and gazed tranquilly around her. She did not feel the least\r\nemotion, but considered that it was a mistake not to light the lamps.\r\nTheir brightness would have given the place a more cheerful look. The\r\ngloom even struck her as savouring of impropriety. Her face was warmed\r\nby the flames of some candles burning in a candelabrum by her side, and\r\nan old woman armed with a big knife was scraping off the wax which had\r\ntrickled down and congealed into pale tears. And amidst the quivering\r\nsilence, the mute ecstasy of adoration prevailing in the chapel, Lisa\r\nwould distinctly hear the rumbling of the vehicles turning out of the\r\nRue Montmartre, behind the scarlet and purple saints on the windows,\r\nwhilst in the distance the markets roared without a moment\u2019s pause.\r\n\r\nJust as Lisa was leaving the chapel, she saw the younger of the\r\nMehudins, Claire, the dealer in fresh water fish, come in. The girl\r\nlighted a taper at the candelabrum, and then went to kneel behind a\r\npillar, her knees pressed upon the hard stones, and her face so pale\r\nbeneath her loose fair hair that she seemed a corpse. And believing\r\nherself to be securely screened from observation, she gave way to\r\nviolent emotion, and wept hot tears with a passionate outpouring of\r\nprayer which bent her like a rushing wind. Lisa looked on in amazement,\r\nfor the Mehudins were not known to be particularly pious; indeed,\r\nClaire was accustomed to speak of religion and priests in such terms as\r\nto horrify one.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the meaning of this, I wonder?\u201D pondered Lisa, as she again\r\nmade her way to the chapel of Saint Agnes. \u201CThe hussy must have been\r\npoisoning some one or other.\u201D\r\n\r\nAbb\u00E9 Roustan was at last coming out of his confessional. He was a\r\nhandsome man, of some forty years of age, with a smiling, kindly air.\r\nWhen he recognised Madame Quenu he grasped her hand, called her \u201Cdear\r\nlady,\u201D and conducted her to the vestry, where, taking off his surplice,\r\nhe told her that he would be entirely at her service in a moment. They\r\nreturned, the priest in his cassock, bareheaded, and Lisa strutting\r\nalong in her shawl, and paced up and down in front of the side-chapels\r\nadjacent to the Rue du Jour. They conversed together in low tones. The\r\nsunlight was departing from the stained windows, the church was growing\r\ndark, and the retreating footsteps of the last worshippers sounded but\r\nfaintly over the flagstones.\r\n\r\nLisa explained her doubts and scruples to Abb\u00E9 Roustan. There had never\r\nbeen any question of religion between them; she never confessed, but\r\nmerely consulted him in cases of difficulty, because he was shrewd and\r\ndiscreet, and she preferred him, as she sometimes said, to shady\r\nbusiness men redolent of the galleys. The abbe, on his side, manifested\r\ninexhaustible complaisance. He looked up points of law for her in the\r\nCode, pointed out profitable investments, resolved her moral\r\ndifficulties with great tact, recommended tradespeople to her,\r\ninvariably having an answer ready however diverse and complicated her\r\nrequirements might be. And he supplied all this help in a natural\r\nmatter-of-fact way, without ever introducing the Deity into his talk,\r\nor seeking to obtain any advantage either for himself or the cause of\r\nreligion. A word of thanks and a smile sufficed him. He seemed glad to\r\nhave an opportunity of obliging the handsome Madame Quenu, of whom his\r\nhousekeeper often spoke to him in terms of praise, as of a woman who\r\nwas highly respected in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nTheir consultation that afternoon was of a peculiarly delicate nature.\r\nLisa was anxious to know what steps she might legitimately take, as a\r\nwoman of honour, with respect to her brother-in-law. Had she a right to\r\nkeep a watch upon him, and to do what she could to prevent him from\r\ncompromising her husband, her daughter, and herself? And then how far\r\nmight she go in circumstances of pressing danger? She did not bluntly\r\nput these questions to the abbe, but asked them with such skilful\r\ncircumlocutions that he was able to discuss the matter without entering\r\ninto personalities. He brought forward arguments on both sides of the\r\nquestion, but the conclusion he came to was that a person of integrity\r\nwas entitled, indeed bound, to prevent evil, and was justified in using\r\nwhatever means might be necessary to ensure the triumph of that which\r\nwas right and proper.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is my opinion, dear lady,\u201D he said in conclusion. \u201CThe question\r\nof means is always a very grave one. It is a snare in which souls of\r\naverage virtue often become entangled. But I know your scrupulous\r\nconscience. Deliberate carefully over each step you think of taking,\r\nand if it contains nothing repugnant to you, go on boldly. Pure natures\r\nhave the marvelous gift of purifying all that they touch.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, changing his tone of voice, he continued: \u201CPray give my kind\r\nregards to Monsieur Quenu. I\u2019ll come in to kiss my dear little Pauline\r\nsome time when I\u2019m passing. And now good-bye, dear lady; remember that\r\nI\u2019m always at your service.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon he returned to the vestry. Lisa, on her way out, was curious\r\nto see if Claire was still praying, but the girl had gone back to her\r\neels and carp; and in front of the Lady-chapel, which was already\r\nshrouded in darkness, there was now but a litter of chairs overturned\r\nby the ardent vehemence of the woman who had knelt there.\r\n\r\nWhen the handsome Lisa again crossed the square, La Normande, who had\r\nbeen watching for her exit from the church, recognised her in the\r\ntwilight by the rotundity of her skirts.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood gracious!\u201D she exclaimed, \u201Cshe\u2019s been more than an hour in there!\r\nWhen the priests set about cleansing her of her sins, the choir-boys\r\nhave to form in line to pass the buckets of filth and empty them in the\r\nstreet!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe next morning Lisa went straight up to Florent\u2019s bedroom and settled\r\nherself there with perfect equanimity. She felt certain that she would\r\nnot be disturbed, and, moreover, she had made up her mind to tell a\r\nfalsehood and say that she had come to see if the linen was clean,\r\nshould Florent by any chance return. Whilst in the shop, however, she\r\nhad observed him busily engaged in the fish market. Seating herself in\r\nfront of the little table, she pulled out the drawer, placed it upon\r\nher knees, and began to examine its contents, taking the greatest care\r\nto restore them to their original positions.\r\n\r\nFirst of all she came upon the opening chapters of the work on Cayenne;\r\nthen upon the drafts of Florent\u2019s various plans and projects, his\r\nschemes for converting the Octroi duties into taxes upon sales, for\r\nreforming the administrative system of the markets, and all the others.\r\nThese pages of small writing, which she set herself to read, bored her\r\nextremely, and she was about to restore the drawer to its place,\r\nfeeling convinced that Florent concealed the proofs of his wicked\r\ndesigns elsewhere, and already contemplating a searching visitation of\r\nhis mattress, when she discovered a photograph of La Normande in an\r\nenvelope. The impression was rather dark. La Normande was standing up\r\nwith her right arm resting on a broken column. Decked out with all her\r\njewels, and attired in a new silk dress, the fish-girl was smiling\r\nimpudently, and Lisa, at the sight, forgot all about her\r\nbrother-in-law, her fears, and the purpose for which she had come into\r\nthe room. She became quite absorbed in her examination of the portrait,\r\nas often happens when one woman scrutinises the photograph of another\r\nat her ease, without fear of being seen. Never before had she so\r\nfavourable an opportunity to study her rival. She scrutinised her hair,\r\nher nose, her mouth; held the photograph at a distance, and then\r\nbrought it closer again. And, finally, with compressed lips, she read\r\non the back of it, in a big, ugly scrawl: \u201CLouise, to her friend,\r\nFlorent.\u201D This quite scandalised her; to her mind it was a confession,\r\nand she felt a strong impulse to take possession of the photograph, and\r\nkeep it as a weapon against her enemy. However, she slowly replaced it\r\nin the envelope on coming to the conclusion that this course would be\r\nwrong, and reflecting that she would always know where to find it\r\nshould she want it again.\r\n\r\nThen, as she again began turning over the loose sheets of paper, it\r\noccurred to her to look at the back end of the drawer, where Florent\r\nhad relegated Augustine\u2019s needles and thread; and there, between the\r\nmissal and the Dream-book, she discovered what she sought, some\r\nextremely compromising memoranda, simply screened from observation by a\r\nwrapper of grey paper.\r\n\r\nThat idea of an insurrection, of the overthrow of the Empire by means\r\nof an armed rising, which Logre had one evening propounded at Monsieur\r\nLebigre\u2019s, had slowly ripened in Florent\u2019s feverish brain. He soon grew\r\nto see a duty, a mission in it. Therein undoubtedly lay the task to\r\nwhich his escape from Cayenne and his return to Paris predestined him.\r\nBelieving in a call to avenge his leanness upon the city which wallowed\r\nin food while the upholders of right and equity were racked by hunger\r\nin exile, he took upon himself the duties of a justiciary, and dreamt\r\nof rising up, even in the midst of those markets, to sweep away the\r\nreign of gluttony and drunkenness. In a sensitive nature like his, this\r\nidea quickly took root. Everything about him assumed exaggerated\r\nproportions, the wildest fancies possessed him. He imagined that the\r\nmarkets had been conscious of his arrival, and had seized hold of him\r\nthat they might enervate him and poison him with their stenches. Then,\r\ntoo, Lisa wanted to cast a spell over him, and for two or three days at\r\na time he would avoid her, as though she were some dissolving agency\r\nwhich would destroy all his power of will should he approach too\r\nclosely. However, these paroxysms of puerile fear, these wild surgings\r\nof his rebellious brain, always ended in thrills of the gentlest\r\ntenderness, with yearnings to love and be loved, which he concealed\r\nwith a boyish shame.\r\n\r\nIt was more especially in the evening that his mind became blurred by\r\nall his wild imaginings. Depressed by his day\u2019s work, but shunning\r\nsleep from a covert fear\u2014the fear of the annihilation it brought with\r\nit\u2014he would remain later than ever at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, or at the\r\nMehudins\u2019; and on his return home he still refrained from going to bed,\r\nand sat up writing and preparing for the great insurrection. By slow\r\ndegrees he devised a complete system of organisation. He divided Paris\r\ninto twenty sections, one for each arrondissement. Each section would\r\nhave a chief, a sort of general, under whose orders there were to be\r\ntwenty lieutenants commanding twenty companies of affiliated\r\nassociates. Every week, among the chiefs, there would be a\r\nconsultation, which was to be held in a different place each time; and,\r\nthe better to ensure secrecy and discretion, the associates would only\r\ncome in contact with their respective lieutenants, these alone\r\ncommunicating with the chiefs of the sections. It also occurred to\r\nFlorent that it would be as well that the companies should believe\r\nthemselves charged with imaginary missions, as a means of putting the\r\npolice upon a wrong scent.\r\n\r\nAs for the employment of the insurrectionary forces, that would be all\r\nsimplicity. It would, of course, be necessary to wait till the\r\ncompanies were quite complete, and then advantage would be taken of the\r\nfirst public commotion. They would doubtless only have a certain number\r\nof guns used for sporting purposes in their possession, so they would\r\ncommence by seizing the police stations and guard-houses, disarming the\r\nsoldiers of the line; resorting to violence as little as possible, and\r\ninviting the men to make common cause with the people. Afterwards they\r\nwould march upon the Corps L\u00E9gislatif, and thence to the H\u00F4tel de\r\nVille. This plan, to which Florent returned night after night, as\r\nthough it were some dramatic scenario which relieved his over-excited\r\nnervous system, was as yet simply jotted down on scraps of paper, full\r\nof erasures, which showed how the writer had felt his way, and revealed\r\neach successive phase of his scientific yet puerile conception. When\r\nLisa had glanced through the notes, without understanding some of them,\r\nshe remained there trembling with fear; afraid to touch them further\r\nlest they should explode in her hands like live shells.\r\n\r\nA last memorandum frightened her more than any of the others. It was a\r\nhalf sheet of paper on which Florent had sketched the distinguishing\r\ninsignia which the chiefs and the lieutenants were to wear. By the side\r\nof these were rough drawings of the standards which the different\r\ncompanies were to carry; and notes in pencil even described what\r\ncolours the banners should assume. The chiefs were to wear red scarves,\r\nand the lieutenants red armlets.\r\n\r\nTo Lisa this seemed like an immediate realisation of the rising; she\r\nsaw all the men with their red badges marching past the pork shop,\r\nfiring bullets into her mirrors and marble, and carrying off sausages\r\nand chitterlings from the window. The infamous projects of her\r\nbrother-in-law were surely directed against herself\u2014against her own\r\nhappiness. She closed the drawer and looked round the room, reflecting\r\nthat it was she herself who had provided this man with a home\u2014that he\r\nslept between her sheets and used her furniture. And she was especially\r\nexasperated at his keeping his abominable infernal machine in that\r\nlittle deal table which she herself had used at Uncle Gradelle\u2019s before\r\nher marriage\u2014a perfectly innocent, rickety little table.\r\n\r\nFor a while she stood thinking what she should do. In the first place,\r\nit was useless to say anything to Quenu. For a moment it occurred to\r\nher to provoke an explanation with Florent, but she dismissed that\r\nidea, fearing lest he would only go and perpetrate his crime elsewhere,\r\nand maliciously make a point of compromising them. Then gradually\r\ngrowing somewhat calmer, she came to the conclusion that her best plan\r\nwould be to keep a careful watch over her brother-in-law. It would be\r\ntime enough to take further steps at the first sign of danger. She\r\nalready had quite sufficient evidence to send him back to the galleys.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the shop again, she found Augustine in a state of great\r\nexcitement. Little Pauline had disappeared more than half an hour\r\nbefore, and to Lisa\u2019s anxious questions the young woman could only\r\nreply: \u201CI don\u2019t know where she can have got to, madame. She was on the\r\npavement there with a little boy. I was watching them, and then I had\r\nto cut some ham for a gentleman, and I never saw them again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll wager it was Muche!\u201D cried Lisa. \u201CAh, the young scoundrel!\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, Muche who had enticed Pauline away. The little girl,\r\nwho was wearing a new blue-striped frock that day for the first time,\r\nhad been anxious to exhibit it, and had accordingly taken her stand\r\noutside the shop, manifesting great propriety of bearing, and\r\ncompressing her lips with the grave expression of a little woman of six\r\nwho is afraid of soiling her clothes. Her short and stiffly-starched\r\npetticoats stood out like the skirts of a ballet girl, allowing a full\r\nview of her tightly stretched white stockings and little sky-blue\r\nboots. Her pinafore, which hung low about her neck, was finished off at\r\nthe shoulders with an edging of embroidery, below which appeared her\r\npretty little arms, bare and rosy. She had small turquoise rings in her\r\nears, a cross at her neck, a blue velvet ribbon in her well-brushed\r\nhair; and she displayed all her mother\u2019s plumpness and softness\u2014the\r\ngracefulness, indeed, of a new doll.\r\n\r\nMuche had caught sight of her from the market, where he was amusing\r\nhimself by dropping little dead fishes into the gutter, following them\r\nalong the kerb as the water carried them away, and declaring that they\r\nwere swimming. However, the sight of Pauline standing in front of the\r\nshop and looking so smart and pretty made him cross over to her,\r\ncapless as he was, with his blouse ragged, his trousers slipping down,\r\nand his whole appearance suggestive of a seven-year-old street-arab.\r\nHis mother had certainly forbidden him to play any more with \u201Cthat fat\r\nbooby of a girl who was stuffed by her parents till she almost burst\u201D;\r\nso he stood hesitating for a moment, but at last came up to Pauline,\r\nand wanted to feel her pretty striped frock. The little girl, who had\r\nat first felt flattered, then put on a prim air and stepped back,\r\nexclaiming in a tone of displeasure: \u201CLeave me alone. Mother says I\u2019m\r\nnot to have anything to do with you.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis brought a laugh to the lips of Muche, who was a wily, enterprising\r\nyoung scamp.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a little flat you are!\u201D he retorted. \u201CWhat does it matter what\r\nyour mother says? Let\u2019s go and play at shoving each other, eh?\u201D\r\n\r\nHe doubtless nourished some wicked idea of dirtying the neat little\r\ngirl; but she, on seeing him prepare to give her a push in the back,\r\nretreated as though about to return inside the shop. Muche thereupon\r\nadopted a flattering tone like a born cajoler.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou silly! I didn\u2019t mean it,\u201D said he. \u201CHow nice you look like that!\r\nIs that little cross your mother\u2019s?\u201D\r\n\r\nPauline perked herself up, and replied that it was her own, whereupon\r\nMuche gently led her to the corner of the Rue Pirouette, touching her\r\nskirts the while and expressing his astonishment at their wonderful\r\nstiffness. All this pleased the little girl immensely. She had been\r\nvery much vexed at not receiving any notice while she was exhibiting\r\nherself outside the shop. However, in spite of all Muche\u2019s\r\nblandishments, she still refused to leave the footway.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou stupid fatty!\u201D thereupon exclaimed the youngster, relapsing into\r\ncoarseness. \u201CI\u2019ll squat you down in the gutter if you don\u2019t look out,\r\nMiss Fine-airs!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe girl was dreadfully alarmed. Muche had caught hold of her by the\r\nhand; but, recognising his mistake in policy, he again put on a\r\nwheedling air, and began to fumble in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve got a sou,\u201D said he.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the coin had a soothing effect upon Pauline. The boy held\r\nup the sou with the tips of his fingers, and the temptation to follow\r\nit proved so great that the girl at last stepped down into the roadway.\r\nMuche\u2019s diplomacy was eminently successful.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you like best?\u201D he asked.\r\n\r\nPauline gave no immediate answer. She could not make up her mind; there\r\nwere so many things that she liked. Muche, however, ran over a whole\r\nlist of dainties\u2014liquorice, molasses, gum-balls, and powdered sugar.\r\nThe powdered sugar made the girl ponder. One dipped one\u2019s fingers into\r\nit and sucked them; it was very nice. For a while she gravely\r\nconsidered the matter. Then, at last making up her mind, she said:\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, I like the mixed screws the best.\u201D\r\n\r\nMuche thereupon took hold of her arm, and she unresistingly allowed him\r\nto lead her away. They crossed the Rue Rambuteau, followed the broad\r\nfootway skirting the markets, and went as far as a grocer\u2019s shop in the\r\nRue de la Cossonnerie which was celebrated for its mixed screws. These\r\nmixed screws are small screws of paper in which grocers put up all\r\nsorts of damaged odds and ends, broken sugar-plums, fragments of\r\ncrystallised chestnuts\u2014all the doubtful residuum of their jars of\r\nsweets. Muche showed himself very gallant, allowed Pauline to choose\r\nthe screw\u2014a blue one\u2014paid his sou, and did not attempt to dispossess\r\nher of the sweets. Outside, on the footway, she emptied the\r\nmiscellaneous collection of scraps into both pockets of her pinafore;\r\nand they were such little pockets that they were quite filled. Then in\r\ndelight she began to munch the fragments one by one, wetting her\r\nfingers to catch the fine sugary dust, with such effect that she melted\r\nthe scraps of sweets, and the pockets of her pinafore soon showed two\r\nbrownish stains. Muche laughed slily to himself. He had his arm about\r\nthe girl\u2019s waist, and rumpled her frock at his ease whilst leading her\r\nround the corner of the Rue Pierre Lescot, in the direction of the\r\nPlace des Innocents.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll come and play now, won\u2019t you?\u201D he asked. \u201CThat\u2019s nice what\r\nyou\u2019ve got in your pockets, ain\u2019t it? You see that I didn\u2019t want to do\r\nyou any harm, you big silly!\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon he plunged his own fingers into her pockets, and they entered\r\nthe square together. To this spot, no doubt, he had all along intended\r\nto lure his victim. He did the honours of the square as though it were\r\nhis own private property, and indeed it was a favourite haunt of his,\r\nwhere he often larked about for whole afternoons. Pauline had never\r\nbefore strayed so far from home, and would have wept like an abducted\r\ndamsel had it not been that her pockets were full of sweets. The\r\nfountain in the middle of the flowered lawn was sending sheets of water\r\ndown its tiers of basins, whilst, between the pilasters above, Jean\r\nGoujon\u2019s nymphs, looking very white beside the dingy grey stonework,\r\ninclined their urns and displayed their nude graces in the grimy air of\r\nthe Saint Denis quarter. The two children walked round the fountain,\r\nwatching the water fall into the basins, and taking an interest in the\r\ngrass, with thoughts, no doubt, of crossing the central lawn, or\r\ngliding into the clumps of holly and rhododendrons that bordered the\r\nrailings of the square. Little Muche, however, who had now effectually\r\nrumpled the back of the pretty frock, said with his sly smile:\r\n\r\n\u201CLet\u2019s play at throwing sand at each other, eh?\u201D\r\n\r\nPauline had no will of her own left; and they began to throw the sand\r\nat each other, keeping their eyes closed meanwhile. The sand made its\r\nway in at the neck of the girl\u2019s low bodice, and trickled down into her\r\nstockings and boots. Muche was delighted to see the white pinafore\r\nbecome quite yellow. But he doubtless considered that it was still far\r\ntoo clean.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet\u2019s go and plant trees, shall we?\u201D he exclaimed suddenly. \u201CI know\r\nhow to make such pretty gardens.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, gardens!\u201D murmured Pauline full of admiration.\r\n\r\nThen, as the keeper of the square happened to be absent, Muche told her\r\nto make some holes in one of the borders; and dropping on her knees in\r\nthe middle of the soft mould, and leaning forward till she lay at full\r\nlength on her stomach, she dug her pretty little arms into the ground.\r\nHe, meantime, began to hunt for scraps of wood, and broke off branches.\r\nThese were the garden-trees which he planted in the holes that Pauline\r\nmade. He invariably complained, however, that the holes were not deep\r\nenough, and rated the girl as though she were an idle workman and he an\r\nindignant master. When she at last got up, she was black from head to\r\nfoot. Her hair was full of mould, her face was smeared with it, she\r\nlooked such a sight with her arms as black as a coalheaver\u2019s that Muche\r\nclapped his hands with glee, and exclaimed: \u201CNow we must water the\r\ntrees. They won\u2019t grow, you know, if we don\u2019t water them.\u201D\r\n\r\nThat was the finishing stroke. They went outside the square, scooped\r\nthe gutter-water up in the palms of their hands, and then ran back to\r\npour it over the bits of wood. On the way, Pauline, who was so fat that\r\nshe couldn\u2019t run properly, let the water trickle between her fingers on\r\nto her frock, so that by the time of her sixth journey she looked as if\r\nshe had been rolled in the gutter. Muche chuckled with delight on\r\nbeholding her dreadful condition. He made her sit down beside him under\r\na rhododendron near the garden they had made, and told her that the\r\ntrees were already beginning to grow. He had taken hold of her hand and\r\ncalled her his little wife.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re not sorry now that you came, are you,\u201D he asked, \u201Cinstead of\r\nmooning about on the pavement, where there was nothing to do? I know\r\nall sorts of fun we can have in the streets; you must come with me\r\nagain. You will, won\u2019t you? But you mustn\u2019t say anything to your\r\nmother, mind. If you say a word to her, I\u2019ll pull your hair the next\r\ntime I come past your shop.\u201D\r\n\r\nPauline consented to everything; and then, as a last attention, Muche\r\nfilled both pockets of her pinafore with mould. However, all the sweets\r\nwere finished, and the girl began to get uneasy, and ceased playing.\r\nMuche thereupon started pinching her, and she burst into tears, sobbing\r\nthat she wanted to go away. But at this the lad only grinned, and\r\nplayed the bully, threatening that he would not take her home at all.\r\nThen she grew terribly alarmed, and sobbed and gasped like a maiden in\r\nthe power of a libertine. Muche would certainly have ended by punching\r\nher in order to stop her row, had not a shrill voice, the voice of\r\nMademoiselle Saget, exclaimed, close by: \u201CWhy, I declare it\u2019s Pauline!\r\nLeave her alone, you wicked young scoundrel!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen the old maid took the girl by the hand, with endless expressions\r\nof amazement at the pitiful condition of her clothes. Muche showed no\r\nalarm, but followed them, chuckling to himself, and declaring that it\r\nwas Pauline who had wanted to come with him, and had tumbled down.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget was a regular frequenter of the Square des\r\nInnocents. Every afternoon she would spend a good hour there to keep\r\nherself well posted in the gossip of the common people. On either side\r\nthere is a long crescent of benches placed end to end; and on these the\r\npoor folks who stifle in the hovels of the neighbouring narrow streets\r\nassemble in crowds. There are withered, chilly-looking old women in\r\ntumbled caps, and young ones in loose jackets and carelessly fastened\r\nskirts, with bare heads and tired, faded faces, eloquent of the\r\nwretchedness of their lives. There are some men also: tidy old buffers,\r\nporters in greasy jackets, and equivocal-looking individuals in black\r\nsilk hats, while the foot-path is overrun by a swarm of youngsters\r\ndragging toy carts without wheels about, filling pails with sand, and\r\nscreaming and fighting; a dreadful crew, with ragged clothes and dirty\r\nnoses, teeming in the sunshine like vermin.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget was so slight and thin that she always managed to\r\ninsinuate herself into a place on one of the benches. She listened to\r\nwhat was being said, and started a conversation with her neighbour,\r\nsome sallow-faced workingman\u2019s wife, who sat mending linen, from time\r\nto time producing handkerchiefs and stockings riddled with holes from a\r\nlittle basket patched up with string. Moreover, Mademoiselle Saget had\r\nplenty of acquaintances here. Amidst the excruciating squalling of the\r\nchildren, and the ceaseless rumble of the traffic in the Rue Saint\r\nDenis, she took part in no end of gossip, everlasting tales about the\r\ntradesmen of the neighbourhood, the grocers, the butchers, and the\r\nbakers, enough, indeed, to fill the columns of a local paper, and the\r\nwhole envenomed by refusals of credit and covert envy, such as is\r\nalways harboured by the poor. From these wretched creatures she also\r\nobtained the most disgusting revelations, the gossip of low\r\nlodging-houses and doorkeepers\u2019 black-holes, all the filthy scandal of\r\nthe neighbourhood, which tickled her inquisitive appetite like hot\r\nspice.\r\n\r\nAs she sat with her face turned towards the markets, she had\r\nimmediately in front of her the square and its three blocks of houses,\r\ninto the windows of which her eyes tried to pry. She seemed to\r\ngradually rise and traverse the successive floors right up to the\r\ngarret skylights. She stared at the curtains; based an entire drama on\r\nthe appearance of a head between two shutters; and, by simply gazing at\r\nthe facades, ended by knowing the history of all the dwellers in these\r\nhouses. The Baratte Restaurant, with its wine shop, its gilt\r\nwrought-iron _marquise_, forming a sort of terrace whence peeped the\r\nfoliage of a few plants in flower-pots, and its four low storeys, all\r\npainted and decorated, had an especial interest for her. She gazed at\r\nits yellow columns standing out against a background of tender blue, at\r\nthe whole of its imitation temple-front daubed on the facade of a\r\ndecrepit, tumble-down house, crowned at the summit by a parapet of\r\npainted zinc. Behind the red-striped window-blinds she espied visions\r\nof nice little lunches, delicate suppers, and uproarious, unlimited\r\norgies. And she did not hesitate to invent lies about the place. It was\r\nthere, she declared, that Florent came to gorge with those two hussies,\r\nthe Mehudins, on whom he lavished his money.\r\n\r\nHowever, Pauline cried yet louder than before when the old maid took\r\nhold of her hand. Mademoiselle Saget at first led her towards the gate\r\nof the square; but before she got there she seemed to change her mind;\r\nfor she sat down at the end of a bench and tried to pacify the child.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, now, give over crying, or the policeman will lock you up,\u201D she\r\nsaid to Pauline. \u201CI\u2019ll take you home safely. You know me, don\u2019t you?\r\nI\u2019m a good friend. Come, come, let me see how prettily you can smile.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe child, however, was choking with sobs and wanted to go away.\r\nMademoiselle Saget thereupon quietly allowed her to continue weeping,\r\nreserving further remarks till she should have finished. The poor\r\nlittle creature was shivering all over; her petticoats and stockings\r\nwere wet through, and as she wiped her tears away with her dirty hands\r\nshe plastered the whole of her face with earth to the very tips of her\r\nears. When at last she became a little calmer the old maid resumed in a\r\ncaressing tone: \u201CYour mamma isn\u2019t unkind, is she? She\u2019s very fond of\r\nyou, isn\u2019t she?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes, indeed,\u201D replied Pauline, still sobbing.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd your papa, he\u2019s good to you, too, isn\u2019t he? He doesn\u2019t flog you,\r\nor quarrel with your mother, does he? What do they talk about when they\r\ngo to bed?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m asleep then.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo they talk about your cousin Florent?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget thereupon assumed a severe expression, and got up as\r\nif about to go away.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid you are a little story-teller,\u201D she said. \u201CDon\u2019t you know\r\nthat it\u2019s very wicked to tell stories? I shall go away and leave you,\r\nif you tell me lies, and then Muche will come back and pinch you.\u201D\r\n\r\nPauline began to cry again at the threat of being abandoned. \u201CBe quiet,\r\nbe quiet, you wicked little imp!\u201D cried the old maid shaking her.\r\n\u201CThere, there, now, I won\u2019t go away. I\u2019ll buy you a stick of\r\nbarley-sugar; yes, a stick of barley-sugar! So you don\u2019t love your\r\ncousin Florent, eh?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, mamma says he isn\u2019t good.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, then, so you see your mother does say something.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COne night when I was in bed with Mouton\u2014I sleep with Mouton sometimes,\r\nyou know\u2014I heard her say to father, \u2018Your brother has only escaped from\r\nthe galleys to take us all back with him there.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget gave vent to a faint cry, and sprang to her feet,\r\nquivering all over. A ray of light had just broken upon her. Then\r\nwithout a word she caught hold of Pauline\u2019s hand and made her run till\r\nthey reached the pork shop, her lips meanwhile compressed by an inward\r\nsmile, and her eyes glistening with keen delight. At the corner of the\r\nRue Pirouette, Muche, who had so far followed them, amused at seeing\r\nthe girl running along in her muddy stockings, prudently disappeared.\r\n\r\nLisa was now in a state of terrible alarm; and when she saw her\r\ndaughter so bedraggled and limp, her consternation was such that she\r\nturned the child round and round, without even thinking of beating her.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe has been with little Muche,\u201D said the old maid, in her malicious\r\nvoice. \u201CI took her away at once, and I\u2019ve brought her home. I found\r\nthem together in the square. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve been up to; but\r\nthat young vagabond is capable of anything.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa could not find a word to say; and she did not know where to take\r\nhold of her daughter, so great was her disgust at the sight of the\r\nchild\u2019s muddy boots, soiled stockings, torn skirts, and filthy face and\r\nhands. The blue velvet ribbon, the earrings, and the necklet were all\r\nconcealed beneath a crust of mud. But what put the finishing touch to\r\nLisa\u2019s exasperation was the discovery of the two pockets filled with\r\nmould. She stooped and emptied them, regardless of the pink and white\r\nflooring of the shop. And as she dragged Pauline away, she could only\r\ngasp: \u201CCome along, you filthy thing!\u201D\r\n\r\nQuite enlivened by this scene, Mademoiselle Saget now hurriedly made\r\nher way across the Rue Rambuteau. Her little feet scarcely touched the\r\nground; her joy seemed to carry her along like a breeze which fanned\r\nher with a caressing touch. She had at last found out what she had so\r\nmuch wanted to know! For nearly a year she had been consumed by\r\ncuriosity, and now at a single stroke she had gained complete power\r\nover Florent! This was unhoped-for contentment, positive salvation, for\r\nshe felt that Florent would have brought her to the tomb had she failed\r\nmuch longer in satisfying her curiosity about him. At present she was\r\ncomplete mistress of the whole neighbourhood of the markets. There was\r\nno longer any gap in her information. She could have narrated the\r\nsecret history of every street, shop by shop. And thus, as she entered\r\nthe fruit market, she fairly gasped with delight, in a perfect\r\ntransport of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\u201CHallo, Mademoiselle Saget,\u201D cried La Sarriette from her stall, \u201Cwhat\r\nare you smiling to yourself like that about? Have you won the grand\r\nprize in the lottery?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no. Ah, my dear, if you only knew!\u201D\r\n\r\nStanding there amidst her fruit, La Sarriette, in her picturesque\r\ndisarray, looked charming. Frizzy hair fell over her brow like vine\r\nbranches. Her bare arms and neck, indeed all the rosy flesh she showed,\r\nbloomed with the freshness of peach and cherry. She had playfully hung\r\nsome cherries on her ears, black cherries which dangled against her\r\ncheeks when she stooped, shaking with merry laughter. She was eating\r\ncurrants, and her merriment arose from the way in which she was\r\nsmearing her face with them. Her lips were bright red, glistening with\r\nthe juice of the fruit, as though they had been painted and perfumed\r\nwith some seraglio face-paint. A perfume of plum exhaled from her gown,\r\nwhile from the kerchief carelessly fastened across her breast came an\r\nodour of strawberries.\r\n\r\nFruits of all kinds were piled around her in her narrow stall. On the\r\nshelves at the back were rows of melons, so-called \u201Ccantaloups\u201D\r\nswarming with wart-like knots, \u201Cmaraichers\u201D whose skin was covered with\r\ngrey lace-like netting, and \u201Cculs-de-singe\u201D displaying smooth bare\r\nbumps. In front was an array of choice fruits, carefully arranged in\r\nbaskets, and showing like smooth round cheeks seeking to hide\r\nthemselves, or glimpses of sweet childish faces, half veiled by leaves.\r\nEspecially was this the case with the peaches, the blushing peaches of\r\nMontreuil, with skin as delicate and clear as that of northern maidens,\r\nand the yellow, sun-burnt peaches from the south, brown like the\r\ndamsels of Provence. The apricots, on their beds of moss, gleamed with\r\nthe hue of amber or with that sunset glow which so warmly colours the\r\nnecks of brunettes at the nape, just under the little wavy curls which\r\nfall below the chignon. The cherries, ranged one by one, resembled the\r\nshort lips of smiling Chinese girls; the Montmorencies suggested the\r\ndumpy mouths of buxom women; the English ones were longer and\r\ngraver-looking; the common black ones seemed as though they had been\r\nbruised and crushed by kisses; while the white-hearts, with their\r\npatches of rose and white, appeared to smile with mingled merriment and\r\nvexation. Then piles of apples and pears, built up with architectural\r\nsymmetry, often in pyramids, displayed the ruddy glow of budding\r\nbreasts and the gleaming sheen of shoulders, quite a show of nudity,\r\nlurking modestly behind a screen of fern-leaves. There were all sorts\r\nof varieties\u2014little red ones so tiny that they seemed to be yet in the\r\ncradle, shapeless \u201Crambours\u201D for baking, \u201Ccalvilles\u201D in light yellow\r\ngowns, sanguineous-looking \u201CCanadas,\u201D blotched \u201Cchataignier\u201D apples,\r\nfair freckled rennets and dusky russets. Then came the pears\u2014the\r\n\u201Cblanquettes,\u201D the \u201CBritish queens,\u201D the \u201CBeurres,\u201D the \u201Cmessirejeans,\u201D\r\nand the \u201Cduchesses\u201D\u2014some dumpy, some long and tapering, some with\r\nslender necks, and others with thick-set shoulders, their green and\r\nyellow bellies picked out at times with a splotch of carmine. By the\r\nside of these the transparent plums resembled tender, chlorotic\r\nvirgins; the greengages and the Orleans plums paled as with modest\r\ninnocence, while the mirabelles lay like golden beads of a rosary\r\nforgotten in a box amongst sticks of vanilla. And the strawberries\r\nexhaled a sweet perfume\u2014a perfume of youth\u2014especially those little ones\r\nwhich are gathered in the woods, and which are far more aromatic than\r\nthe large ones grown in gardens, for these breathe an insipid odour\r\nsuggestive of the watering-pot. Raspberries added their fragrance to\r\nthe pure scent. The currants\u2014red, white, and black\u2014smiled with a\r\nknowing air; whilst the heavy clusters of grapes, laden with\r\nintoxication, lay languorously at the edges of their wicker baskets,\r\nover the sides of which dangled some of the berries, scorched by the\r\nhot caresses of the voluptuous sun.\r\n\r\nIt was there that La Sarriette lived in an orchard, as it were, in an\r\natmosphere of sweet, intoxicating scents. The cheaper fruits\u2014the\r\ncherries, plums, and strawberries\u2014were piled up in front of her in\r\npaper-lined baskets, and the juice coming from their bruised ripeness\r\nstained the stall-front, and steamed, with a strong perfume, in the\r\nheat. She would feel quite giddy on those blazing July afternoons when\r\nthe melons enveloped her with a powerful, vaporous odour of musk; and\r\nthen with her loosened kerchief, fresh as she was with the springtide\r\nof life, she brought sudden temptation to all who saw her. It was\r\nshe\u2014it was her arms and necks which gave that semblance of amorous\r\nvitality to her fruit. On the stall next to her an old woman, a hideous\r\nold drunkard, displayed nothing but wrinkled apples, pears as flabby as\r\nherself, and cadaverous apricots of a witch-like sallowness. La\r\nSarriette\u2019s stall, however, spoke of love and passion. The cherries\r\nlooked like the red kisses of her bright lips; the silky peaches were\r\nnot more delicate than her neck; to the plums she seemed to have lent\r\nthe skin from her brow and chin; while some of her own crimson blood\r\ncoursed through the veins of the currants. All the scents of the avenue\r\nof flowers behind her stall were but insipid beside the aroma of\r\nvitality which exhaled from her open baskets and falling kerchief.\r\n\r\nThat day she was quite intoxicated by the scent of a large arrival of\r\nmirabelle plums, which filled the market. She could plainly see that\r\nMademoiselle Saget had learnt some great piece of news, and she wished\r\nto make her talk. But the old maid stamped impatiently whilst she\r\nrepeated: \u201CNo, no; I\u2019ve no time. I\u2019m in a great hurry to see Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur. I\u2019ve just learnt something and no mistake. You can come with\r\nme, if you like.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, she had simply gone through the fruit market for\r\nthe purpose of enticing La Sarriette to go with her. The girl could not\r\nrefuse temptation. Monsieur Jules, clean-shaven and as fresh as a\r\ncherub, was seated there, swaying to and fro on his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201CJust look after the stall for a minute, will you?\u201D La Sarriette said\r\nto him. \u201CI\u2019ll be back directly.\u201D\r\n\r\nJules, however, got up and called after her, in a thick voice: \u201CNot I;\r\nno fear! I\u2019m off! I\u2019m not going to wait an hour for you, as I did the\r\nother day. And, besides, those cursed plums of yours quite make my head\r\nache.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he calmly strolled off, with his hands in his pockets, and the\r\nstall was left to look after itself. Mademoiselle Saget went so fast\r\nthat La Sarriette had to run. In the butter pavilion a neighbour of\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur\u2019s told them that she was below in the cellar; and so,\r\nwhilst La Sarriette went down to find her, the old maid installed\r\nherself amidst the cheeses.\r\n\r\nThe cellar under the butter market is a very gloomy spot. The rows of\r\nstorerooms are protected by a very fine wire meshing, as a safeguard\r\nagainst fire; and the gas jets, which are very few and far between,\r\nglimmer like yellow splotches destitute of radiance in the heavy,\r\nmalordorous atmosphere beneath the low vault. Madame Lec\u0153ur, however,\r\nwas at work on her butter at one of the tables placed parallel with the\r\nRue Berger, and here a pale light filtered through the vent-holes. The\r\ntables, which are continually sluiced with a flood of water from the\r\ntaps, are as white as though they were quite new. With her back turned\r\nto the pump in the rear, Madame Lec\u0153ur was kneading her butter in a\r\nkind of oak box. She took some of different sorts which lay beside her,\r\nand mixed the varieties together, correcting one by another, just as is\r\ndone in the blending of wines. Bent almost double, and showing sharp,\r\nbony shoulders, and arms bared to the elbows, as scraggy and knotted as\r\npea-rods, she dug her fists into the greasy paste in front of her,\r\nwhich was assuming a whitish and chalky appearance. It was trying work,\r\nand she heaved a sigh at each fresh effort.\r\n\r\n\u201CMademoiselle Saget wants to speak to you, aunt,\u201D said La Sarriette.\r\n\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur stopped her work, and pulled her cap over her hair with\r\nher greasy fingers, seemingly quite careless of staining it. \u201CI\u2019ve\r\nnearly finished. Ask her to wait a moment,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s got something very particular to tell you,\u201D continued La\r\nSarriette.\r\n\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t be more than a minute, my dear.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she again plunged her arms into the butter, which buried them up\r\nto the elbows. Previously softened in warm water, it covered Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur\u2019s parchment-like skin as with an oily film, and threw the big\r\npurple veins that streaked her flesh into strong relief. La Sarriette\r\nwas quite disgusted by the sight of those hideous arms working so\r\nfrantically amidst the melting mass. However, she could recall the time\r\nwhen her own pretty little hands had manipulated the butter for whole\r\nafternoons at a time. It had even been a sort of almond-paste to her, a\r\ncosmetic which had kept her skin white and her nails delicately pink;\r\nand even now her slender fingers retained the suppleness it had endowed\r\nthem with.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think that butter of yours will be very good, aunt,\u201D she\r\ncontinued, after a pause. \u201CSome of the sorts seem much too strong.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m quite aware of that,\u201D replied Madame Lec\u0153ur, between a couple of\r\ngroans. \u201CBut what can I do? I must use everything up. There are some\r\nfolks who insist upon having butter cheap, and so cheap butter must be\r\nmade for them. Oh! it\u2019s always quite good enough for those who buy it.\u201D\r\n\r\nLa Sarriette reflected that she would hardly care to eat butter which\r\nhad been worked by her aunt\u2019s arms. Then she glanced at a little jar\r\nfull of a sort of reddish dye. \u201CYour colouring is too pale,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\nThis colouring-matter\u2014\u201Craucourt,\u201D as the Parisians call it is used to\r\ngive the butter a fine yellow tint. The butter women imagine that its\r\ncomposition is known only to themselves, and keep it very secret.\r\nHowever, it is merely made from anotta;[*] though a composition of\r\ncarrots and marigold is at times substituted for it.\r\n\r\n[*] Anotta, which is obtained from the pulp surrounding the seeds of\r\nthe _Bixa Orellana_, is used for a good many purposes besides the\r\ncolouring of butter and cheese. It frequently enters into the\r\ncomposition of chocolate, and is employed to dye nankeen. Police court\r\nproceedings have also shown that it is well known to the London\r\nmilkmen, who are in the habit of adding water to their merchandise.\r\n\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, do be quick!\u201D La Sarriette now exclaimed, for she was getting\r\nimpatient, and was, moreover, no longer accustomed to the malodorous\r\natmosphere of the cellar. \u201CMademoiselle Saget will be going. I fancy\r\nshe\u2019s got something very important to tell you abut my uncle Gavard.\u201D\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Madame Lec\u0153ur abruptly ceased working. She at once\r\nabandoned both butter and dye, and did not even wait to wipe her arms.\r\nWith a slight tap of her hand she settled her cap on her head again,\r\nand made her way up the steps, at her niece\u2019s heels, anxiously\r\nrepeating: \u201CDo you really think that she\u2019ll have gone away?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was reassured, however, on catching sight of Mademoiselle Saget\r\namidst the cheeses. The old maid had taken good care not to go away\r\nbefore Madame Lec\u0153ur\u2019s arrival. The three women seated themselves at\r\nthe far end of the stall, crowding closely together, and their faces\r\nalmost touching one another. Mademoiselle Saget remained silent for two\r\nlong minutes, and then, seeing that the others were burning with\r\ncuriosity, she began, in her shrill voice: \u201CYou know that Florent!\r\nWell, I can tell you now where he comes from.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor another moment she kept them in suspense; and then, in a deep,\r\nmelodramatic voice, she said: \u201CHe comes from the galleys!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe cheeses were reeking around the three women. On the two shelves at\r\nthe far end of the stall were huge masses of butter: Brittany butters\r\noverflowing from baskets; Normandy butters, wrapped in canvas, and\r\nresembling models of stomachs over which some sculptor had thrown damp\r\ncloths to keep them from drying; while other great blocks had been cut\r\ninto, fashioned into perpendicular rocky masses full of crevasses and\r\nvalleys, and resembling fallen mountain crests gilded by the pale sun\r\nof an autumn evening.\r\n\r\nBeneath the stall show-table, formed of a slab of red marble veined\r\nwith grey, baskets of eggs gleamed with a chalky whiteness; while on\r\nlayers of straw in boxes were Bondons, placed end to end, and Gournays,\r\narranged like medals, forming darker patches tinted with green. But it\r\nwas upon the table that the cheeses appeared in greatest profusion.\r\nHere, by the side of the pound-rolls of butter lying on white-beet\r\nleaves, spread a gigantic Cantal cheese, cloven here and there as by an\r\naxe; then came a golden-hued Cheshire, and next a Gruyere, resembling a\r\nwheel fallen from some barbarian chariot; whilst farther on were some\r\nDutch cheeses, suggesting decapitated heads suffused with dry blood,\r\nand having all that hardness of skulls which in France has gained them\r\nthe name of \u201Cdeath\u2019s heads.\u201D Amidst the heavy exhalations of these, a\r\nParmesan set a spicy aroma. Then there came three Brie cheeses\r\ndisplayed on round platters, and looking like melancholy extinct moons.\r\nTwo of them, very dry, were at the full; the third, in its second\r\nquarter, was melting away in a white cream, which had spread into a\r\npool and flowed over the little wooden barriers with which an attempt\r\nhad been made to arrest its course. Next came some Port Saluts, similar\r\nto antique discs, with exergues bearing their makers\u2019 names in print. A\r\nRomantour, in its tin-foil wrapper, suggested a bar of nougat or some\r\nsweet cheese astray amidst all these pungent, fermenting curds. The\r\nRoqueforts under their glass covers also had a princely air, their fat\r\nfaces marbled with blue and yellow, as though they were suffering from\r\nsome unpleasant malady such as attacks the wealthy gluttons who eat too\r\nmany truffles. And on a dish by the side of these, the hard grey goats\u2019\r\nmilk cheeses, about the size of a child\u2019s fist, resembled the pebbles\r\nwhich the billy-goats send rolling down the stony paths as they clamber\r\nalong ahead of their flocks. Next came the strong smelling cheeses: the\r\nMont d\u2019Ors, of a bright yellow hue, and exhaling a comparatively mild\r\nodour; the Troyes, very thick, and bruised at the edges, and of a far\r\nmore pungent smell, recalling the dampness of a cellar; the Camemberts,\r\nsuggestive of high game; the square Neufchatels, Limbourgs, Marolles,\r\nand Pont l\u2019Eveques, each adding its own particular sharp scent to the\r\nmalodorous bouquet, till it became perfectly pestilential; the\r\nLivarots, ruddy in hue, and as irritating to the throat as sulphur\r\nfumes; and, lastly, stronger than all the others, the Olivets, wrapped\r\nin walnut leaves, like the carrion which peasants cover with branches\r\nas it lies rotting in the hedgerow under the blazing sun.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the afternoon had softened the cheeses; the patches of\r\nmould on their crusts were melting, and glistening with tints of ruddy\r\nbronze and verdigris. Beneath their cover of leaves, the skins of the\r\nOlivets seemed to be heaving as with the slow, deep respiration of a\r\nsleeping man. A Livarot was swarming with life; and in a fragile box\r\nbehind the scales a Gerome flavoured with aniseed diffused such a\r\npestilential smell that all around it the very flies had fallen\r\nlifeless on the gray-veined slap of ruddy marble.\r\n\r\nThis Gerome was almost immediately under Mademoiselle Saget\u2019s nose; so\r\nshe drew back, and leaned her head against the big sheets of white and\r\nyellow paper which were hanging in a corner.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D she repeated, with an expression of disgust, \u201Che comes from the\r\ngalleys! Ah, those Quenu-Gradelles have no reason to put on so many\r\nairs!\u201D\r\n\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur and La Sarriette, however, had burst into exclamations of\r\nastonishment: \u201CIt wasn\u2019t possible, surely! What had he done to be sent\r\nto the galleys? Could anyone, now, have ever suspected that Madame\r\nQuenu, whose virtue was the pride of the whole neighbourhood, would\r\nchoose a convict for a lover?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, but you don\u2019t understand at all!\u201D cried the old maid impatiently.\r\n\u201CJust listen, now, while I explain things. I was quite certain that I\r\nhad seen that great lanky fellow somewhere before.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she proceeded to tell them Florent\u2019s story. She had recalled to\r\nmind a vague report which had circulated of a nephew of old Gradelle\r\nbeing transported to Cayenne for murdering six gendarmes at a\r\nbarricade. She had even seen this nephew on one occasion in the Rue\r\nPirouette. The pretended cousin was undoubtedly the same man. Then she\r\nbegan to bemoan her waning powers. Her memory was quite going, she\r\nsaid; she would soon be unable to remember anything. And she bewailed\r\nher perishing memory as bitterly as any learned man might bewail the\r\nloss of his notes representing the work of a life-time, on seeing them\r\nswept away by a gust of wind.\r\n\r\n\u201CSix gendarmes!\u201D murmured La Sarriette, admiringly; \u201Che must have a\r\nvery heavy fist!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd he\u2019s made away with plenty of others, as well,\u201D added Mademoiselle\r\nSaget. \u201CI shouldn\u2019t advise you to meet him at night!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a villain!\u201D stammered out Madame Lec\u0153ur, quite terrified.\r\n\r\nThe slanting beams of the sinking sun were now enfilading the pavilion,\r\nand the odour of the cheeses became stronger than ever. That of the\r\nMarolles seemed to predominate, borne hither and thither in powerful\r\nwhiffs. Then, however, the wind appeared to change, and suddenly the\r\nemanations of the Limbourgs were wafted towards the three women,\r\npungent and bitter, like the last gasps of a dying man.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut in that case,\u201D resumed Madame Lec\u0153ur, \u201Che must be fat Lisa\u2019s\r\nbrother-in-law. And we thought that he was her lover!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe women exchanged glances. This aspect of the case took them by\r\nsurprise. They were loth to give up their first theory. However, La\r\nSarriette, turning to Mademoiselle Saget, remarked: \u201CThat must have\r\nbeen all wrong. Besides, you yourself say that he\u2019s always running\r\nafter the two Mehudin girls.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly he is,\u201D exclaimed Mademoiselle Saget sharply, fancying that\r\nher word was doubted. \u201CHe dangles about them every evening. But, after\r\nall, it\u2019s no concern of ours, is it? We are virtuous women, and what he\r\ndoes makes no difference to us, the horrid scoundrel!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, certainly not,\u201D agreed the other two. \u201CHe\u2019s a consummate villain.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe affair was becoming tragical. Of course beautiful Lisa was now out\r\nof the question, but for this they found ample consolation in\r\nprophesying that Florent would bring about some frightful catastrophe.\r\nIt was quite clear, they said, that he had got some base design in his\r\nhead. When people like him escaped from gaol it was only to burn\r\neverything down; and if he had come to the markets it must assuredly be\r\nfor some abominable purpose. Then they began to indulge in the wildest\r\nsuppositions. The two dealers declared that they would put additional\r\npadlocks to the doors of their storerooms; and La Sarriette called to\r\nmind that a basket of peaches had been stolen from her during the\r\nprevious week. Mademoiselle Saget, however, quite frightened the two\r\nothers by informing them that that was not the way in which the Reds\r\nbehaved; they despised such trifles as baskets of peaches; their plan\r\nwas to band themselves together in companies of two or three hundred,\r\nkill everybody they came across, and then plunder and pillage at their\r\nease. That was \u201Cpolitics,\u201D she said, with the superior air of one who\r\nknew what she was talking about. Madame Lec\u0153ur felt quite ill. She\r\nalready saw Florent and his accomplices hiding in the cellars, and\r\nrushing out during the night to set the markets in flames and sack\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! by the way,\u201D suddenly exclaimed the old maid, \u201Cnow I think of it,\r\nthere\u2019s all that money of old Gradelle\u2019s! Dear me, dear me, those\r\nQuenus can\u2019t be at all at their ease!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe now looked quite gay again. The conversation took a fresh turn, and\r\nthe others fell foul of the Quenus when Mademoiselle Saget had told\r\nthem the history of the treasure discovered in the salting-tub, with\r\nevery particular of which she was acquainted. She was even able to\r\ninform them of the exact amount of the money found\u2014eighty-five thousand\r\nfrancs\u2014though neither Lisa nor Quenu was aware of having revealed this\r\nto a living soul. However, it was clear that the Quenus had not given\r\nthe great lanky fellow his share. He was too shabbily dressed for that.\r\nPerhaps he had never even heard of the discovery of the treasure.\r\nPlainly enough, they were all thieves in his family. Then the three\r\nwomen bent their heads together and spoke in lower tones. They were\r\nunanimously of opinion that it might perhaps be dangerous to attack the\r\nbeautiful Lisa, but it was decidedly necessary that they should settle\r\nthe Red Republican\u2019s hash, so that he might no longer prey upon the\r\npurse of poor Monsieur Gavard.\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Gavard there came a pause. The gossips looked at each\r\nother with a circumspect air. And then, as they drew breath, they\r\ninhaled the odour of the Camemberts, whose gamy scent had overpowered\r\nthe less penetrating emanations of the Marolles and the Limbourgs, and\r\nspread around with remarkable power. Every now and then, however, a\r\nslight whiff, a flutelike note, came from the Parmesan, while the Bries\r\ncontributed a soft, musty scent, the gentle, insipid sound, as it were,\r\nof damp tambourines. Next followed an overpowering refrain from the\r\nLivarots, and afterwards the Gerome, flavoured with aniseed, kept up\r\nthe symphony with a high prolonged note, like that of a vocalist during\r\na pause in the accompaniment.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have seen Madame Leonce,\u201D Mademoiselle Saget at last continued, with\r\na significant expression.\r\n\r\nAt this the two others became extremely attentive. Madame Leonce was\r\nthe doorkeeper of the house where Gavard lived in the Rue de la\r\nCossonnerie. It was an old house standing back, with its ground floor\r\noccupied by an importer of oranges and lemons, who had had the frontage\r\ncoloured blue as high as the first floor. Madame Leonce acted as\r\nGavard\u2019s housekeeper, kept the keys of his cupboards and closets, and\r\nbrought him up tisane when he happened to catch cold. She was a\r\nsevere-looking woman, between fifty and sixty years of age, and spoke\r\nslowly, but at endless length. Mademoiselle Saget, who went to drink\r\ncoffee with her every Wednesday evening, had cultivated her friendship\r\nmore closely than ever since the poultry dealer had gone to lodge in\r\nthe house. They would talk about the worthy man for hours at a time.\r\nThey both professed the greatest affection for him, and a keen desire\r\nto ensure his comfort and happiness.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I have seen Madame Leonce,\u201D repeated the old maid. \u201CWe had a cup\r\nof coffee together last night. She was greatly worried. It seems that\r\nMonsieur Gavard never comes home now before one o\u2019clock in the morning.\r\nLast Sunday she took him up some broth, as she thought he looked quite\r\nill.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, she knows very well what she\u2019s about,\u201D exclaimed Madame Lec\u0153ur,\r\nwhom these attentions to Gavard somewhat alarmed.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget felt bound to defend her friend. \u201COh, really, you\r\nare quite mistaken,\u201D said she. \u201CMadame Leonce is much above her\r\nposition; she is quite a lady. If she wanted to enrich herself at\r\nMonsieur Gavard\u2019s expense, she might easily have done so long ago. It\r\nseems that he leaves everything lying about in the most careless\r\nfashion. It\u2019s about that, indeed, that I want to speak to you. But\r\nyou\u2019ll not repeat anything I say, will you? I am telling it you in\r\nstrict confidence.\u201D\r\n\r\nBoth the others swore that they would never breathe a word of what they\r\nmight hear; and they craned out their necks with eager curiosity,\r\nwhilst the old maid solemnly resumed: \u201CWell, then, Monsieur Gavard has\r\nbeen behaving very strangely of late. He has been buying firearms\u2014a\r\ngreat big pistol\u2014one of those which revolve, you know. Madame Leonce\r\nsays that things are awful, for this pistol is always lying about on\r\nthe table or the mantelpiece; and she daren\u2019t dust anywhere near it.\r\nBut that isn\u2019t all. His money\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHis money!\u201D echoed Madame Lec\u0153ur, with blazing cheeks.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, he\u2019s disposed of all his stocks and shares. He\u2019s sold\r\neverything, and keeps a great heap of gold in a cupboard.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA heap of gold!\u201D exclaimed La Sarriette in ecstasy.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, a great heap of gold. It covers a whole shelf, and is quite\r\ndazzling. Madame Leonce told me that one morning Gavard opened the\r\ncupboard in her presence, and that the money quite blinded her, it\r\nshone so.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. The eyes of the three women were blinking as\r\nthough the dazzling pile of gold was before them. Presently La\r\nSarriette began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a jolly time I would have with Jules if my uncle would give that\r\nmoney to me!\u201D said she.\r\n\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur, however, seemed quite overwhelmed by this revelation,\r\ncrushed beneath the weight of the gold which she could not banish from\r\nher sight. Covetous envy thrilled her. But at last, raising her skinny\r\narms and shrivelled hands, her finger-nails still stuffed with butter,\r\nshe stammered in a voice full of bitter distress: \u201COh, I mustn\u2019t think\r\nof it! It\u2019s too dreadful!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, it would all be yours, you know, if anything were to happen to\r\nMonsieur Gavard,\u201D retorted Mademoiselle Saget. \u201CIf I were in your\r\nplace, I would look after my interests. That revolver means nothing\r\ngood, you may depend upon it. Monsieur Gavard has got into the hands of\r\nevil counsellors; and I\u2019m afraid it will all end badly.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen the conversation again turned upon Florent. The three women\r\nassailed him more violently than ever. And afterwards, with perfect\r\ncomposure, they began to discuss what would be the result of all these\r\ndark goings-on so far as he and Gavard were concerned; certainly it\r\nwould be no pleasant one if there was any gossiping. And thereupon they\r\nswore that they themselves would never repeat a word of what they knew;\r\nnot, however, because that scoundrel Florent merited any consideration,\r\nbut because it was necessary, at all costs, to save that worthy\r\nMonsieur Gavard from being compromised. Then they rose from their\r\nseats, and Mademoiselle Saget was burning as if to go away when the\r\nbutter dealer asked her: \u201CAll the same, in case of accident, do you\r\nthink that Madame Leonce can be trusted? I dare say she has the key of\r\nthe cupboard.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, that\u2019s more than I can tell you,\u201D replied the old maid. \u201CI\r\nbelieve she\u2019s a very honest woman; but, after all, there\u2019s no telling.\r\nThere are circumstances, you know, which tempt the best of people.\r\nAnyhow, I\u2019ve warned you both; and you must do what you think proper.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs the three women stood there, taking leave of each other, the odour\r\nof the cheeses seemed to become more pestilential than ever. It was a\r\ncacophony of smells, ranging from the heavily oppressive odour of the\r\nDutch cheeses and the Gruyeres to the alkaline pungency of the Olivets.\r\nFrom the Cantal, the Cheshire, and the goats\u2019 milk cheeses there seemed\r\nto come a deep breath like the sound of a bassoon, amidst which the\r\nsharp, sudden whiffs of the Neufchatels, the Troyes, and the Mont d\u2019Ors\r\ncontributed short, detached notes. And then the different odours\r\nappeared to mingle one with another, the reek of the Limbourgs, the\r\nPort Saluts, the Geromes, the Marolles, the Livarots, and the Pont\r\nl\u2019Eveques uniting in one general, overpowering stench sufficient to\r\nprovoke asphyxia. And yet it almost seemed as though it were not the\r\ncheeses but the vile words of Madame Lec\u0153ur and Mademoiselle Saget that\r\ndiffused this awful odour.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m very much obliged to you, indeed I am,\u201D said the butter dealer.\r\n\u201CIf ever I get rich, you shall not find yourself forgotten.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe old maid still lingered in the stall. Taking up a Bondon, she\r\nturned it round, and put it down on the slab again. Then she asked its\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\u201CTo me!\u201D she added, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, nothing to you,\u201D replied Madame Lec\u0153ur. \u201CI\u2019ll make you a present\r\nof it.\u201D And again she exclaimed: \u201CAh, if I were only rich!\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget thereupon told her that some day or other she would\r\nbe rich. The Bondon had already disappeared within the old maid\u2019s bag.\r\nAnd now the butter dealer returned to the cellar, while Mademoiselle\r\nSaget escorted La Sarriette back to her stall. On reaching it they\r\ntalked for a moment or two about Monsieur Jules. The fruits around them\r\ndiffused a fresh scent of summer.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt smells much nicer here than at your aunt\u2019s,\u201D said the old maid. \u201CI\r\nfelt quite ill a little time ago. I can\u2019t think how she manages to\r\nexist there. But here it\u2019s very sweet and pleasant. It makes you look\r\nquite rosy, my dear.\u201D\r\n\r\nLa Sarriette began to laugh, for she was fond of compliments. Then she\r\nserved a lady with a pound of mirabelle plums, telling her that they\r\nwere as sweet as sugar.\r\n\r\n\u201CI should like to buy some of those mirabelles too,\u201D murmured\r\nMademoiselle Saget, when the lady had gone away; \u201Conly I want so few. A\r\nlone woman, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTake a handful of them,\u201D exclaimed the pretty brunette. \u201CThat won\u2019t\r\nruin me. Send Jules back to me if you see him, will you? You\u2019ll most\r\nlikely find him smoking his cigar on the first bench to the right as\r\nyou turn out of the covered way.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget distended her fingers as widely as possible in order\r\nto take a handful of mirabelles, which joined the Bondon in the bag.\r\nThen she pretended to leave the market, but in reality made a detour by\r\none of the covered ways, thinking, as she walked slowly along, that the\r\nmirabelles and Bondon would not make a very substantial dinner. When\r\nshe was unable, during her afternoon perambulations, to wheedle\r\nstallkeepers into filling her bag for her, she was reduced to dining\r\noff the merest scraps. So she now slyly made her way back to the butter\r\npavilions, where, on the side of the Rue Berger, at the back of the\r\noffices of the oyster salesmen, there were some stalls at which cooked\r\nmeat was sold. Every morning little closed box-like carts, lined with\r\nzinc and furnished with ventilators, drew up in front of the larger\r\nParisian kitchens and carried away the leavings of the restaurants, the\r\nembassies, and State Ministries. These leavings were conveyed to the\r\nmarket cellars and there sorted. By nine o\u2019clock plates of food were\r\ndisplayed for sale at prices ranging from three to five sous, their\r\ncontents comprising slices of meat, scraps of game, heads and tails of\r\nfishes, bits of galantine, stray vegetables, and, by way of dessert,\r\ncakes scarcely cut into, and other confectionery. Poor starving\r\nwretches, scantily-paid clerks, and women shivering with fever were to\r\nbe seen crowding around, and the street lads occasionally amused\r\nthemselves by hooting the pale-faced individuals, known to be misers,\r\nwho only made their purchases after slyly glancing about them to see\r\nthat they were not observed.[*] Mademoiselle Saget wriggled her way to\r\na stall, the keeper of which boasted that the scraps she sold came\r\nexclusively from the Tuileries. One day, indeed, she had induced the\r\nold maid to buy a slice of leg of mutton by informing that it had come\r\nfrom the plate of the Emperor himself; and this slice of mutton, eaten\r\nwith no little pride, had been a soothing consolation to Mademoiselle\r\nSaget\u2019s vanity. The wariness of her approach to the stall was,\r\nmoreover, solely caused by her desire to keep well with the\r\nneighbouring shop people, whose premises she was eternally haunting\r\nwithout ever buying anything. Her usual tactics were to quarrel with\r\nthem as soon as she had managed to learn their histories, when she\r\nwould bestow her patronage upon a fresh set, desert it in due course,\r\nand then gradually make friends again with those with whom she had\r\nquarrelled. In this way she made the complete circuit of the market\r\nneighbourhood, ferreting about in every shop and stall. Anyone would\r\nhave imagined that she consumed an enormous amount of provisions,\r\nwhereas, in point of fact, she lived solely upon presents and the few\r\nscraps which she was compelled to buy when people were not in the\r\ngiving vein.\r\n\r\n[*] The dealers in these scraps are called _bijoutiers_, or jewellers,\r\nwhilst the scraps themselves are known as _harlequins_, the idea being\r\nthat they are of all colours and shapes when mingled together, thus\r\nsuggesting harlequin\u2019s variegated attire.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that particular evening there was only a tall old man standing in\r\nfront of the stall. He was sniffing at a plate containing a mixture of\r\nmeat and fish. Mademoiselle Saget, in her turn, began to sniff at a\r\nplate of cold fried fish. The price of it was three sous, but, by dint\r\nof bargaining, she got it for two. The cold fish then vanished into the\r\nbag. Other customers now arrived, and with a uniform impulse lowered\r\ntheir noses over the plates. The smell of the stall was very\r\ndisgusting, suggestive alike of greasy dishes and a dirty sink.[*]\r\n\r\n[*] Particulars of the strange and repulsive trade in harlequins, which\r\neven nowadays is not extinct, will be found in Privat d\u2019Anglemont\u2019s\r\nwell-known book _Paris Anecdote_, written at the very period with which\r\nM. Zola deals in the present work. My father, Henry Vizetelly, also\r\ngave some account of it in his _Glances Back through Seventy Years_, in\r\na chapter describing the odd ways in which certain Parisians contrive\r\nto get a living.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CCome and see me to-morrow,\u201D the stallkeeper called out to the old\r\nmaid, \u201Cand I\u2019ll put something nice on one side for you. There\u2019s going\r\nto be a grand dinner at the Tuileries to-night.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget was just promising to come, when, happening to turn\r\nround, she discovered Gavard looking at her and listening to what she\r\nwas saying. She turned very red, and, contracting her skinny shoulders,\r\nhurried away, affecting not to recognise him. Gavard, however, followed\r\nher for a few yards, shrugging his shoulders and muttering to himself\r\nthat he was no longer surprised at the old shrew\u2019s malice, now he knew\r\nthat \u201Cshe poisoned herself with the filth carted away from the\r\nTuileries.\u201D\r\n\r\nOn the very next morning vague rumours began to circulate in the\r\nmarkets. Madame Lec\u0153ur and La Sarriette were in their own fashion\r\nkeeping the oaths of silence they had taken. For her own part,\r\nMademoiselle Saget warily held her tongue, leaving the two others to\r\ncirculate the story of Florent\u2019s antecedents. At first only a few\r\nmeagre details were hawked about in low tones; then various versions of\r\nthe facts got into circulation, incidents were exaggerated, and\r\ngradually quite a legend was constructed, in which Florent played the\r\npart of a perfect bogey man. He had killed ten gendarmes at the\r\nbarricade in the Rue Greneta, said some; he had returned to France on a\r\npirate ship whose crew scoured the seas to murder everyone they came\r\nacross, said others; whilst a third set declared that ever since his\r\narrival he had been observed prowling about at nighttime with\r\nsuspicious-looking characters, of whom he was undoubtedly the leader.\r\nSoon the imaginative market women indulged in the highest flights of\r\nfancy, revelled in the most melodramatic ideas. There was talk of a\r\nband of smugglers plying their nefarious calling in the very heart of\r\nParis, and of a vast central association formed for systematically\r\nrobbing the stalls in the markets. Much pity was expressed for the\r\nQuenu-Gradelles, mingled with malicious allusions to their uncle\u2019s\r\nfortune. That fortune was an endless subject of discussion. The general\r\nopinion was that Florent had returned to claim his share of the\r\ntreasure; however, as no good reason was forthcoming to explain why the\r\ndivision had not taken place already, it was asserted that Florent was\r\nwaiting for some opportunity which might enable him to pocket the whole\r\namount. The Quenu-Gradelles would certainly be found murdered some\r\nmorning, it was said; and a rumour spread that dreadful quarrels\r\nalready took place every night between the two brothers and beautiful\r\nLisa.\r\n\r\nWhen these stories reached the ears of the beautiful Norman, she\r\nshrugged her shoulders and burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201CGet away with you!\u201D she cried, \u201Cyou don\u2019t know him. Why, the dear\r\nfellow\u2019s as gentle as a lamb.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe had recently refused the hand of Monsieur Lebigre, who had at last\r\nventured upon a formal proposal. For two months past he had given the\r\nMehudins a bottle of some liqueur every Sunday. It was Rose who brought\r\nit, and she was always charged with a compliment for La Normande, some\r\npretty speech which she faithfully repeated, without appearing in the\r\nslightest degree embarrassed by the peculiar commission. When Monsieur\r\nLebigre was rejected, he did not pine, but to show that he took no\r\noffence and was still hopeful, he sent Rose on the following Sunday\r\nwith two bottles of champagne and a large bunch of flowers. She gave\r\nthem into the handsome fish-girl\u2019s own hands, repeating, as she did so,\r\nthe wine dealer\u2019s prose madrigal:\r\n\r\n\u201CMonsieur Lebigre begs you to drink this to his health, which has been\r\ngreatly shaken by you know what. He hopes that you will one day be\r\nwilling to cure him, by being for him as pretty and as sweet as these\r\nflowers.\u201D\r\n\r\nLa Normande was much amused by the servant\u2019s delighted air. She kissed\r\nher as she spoke to her of her master, and asked her if he wore braces,\r\nand snored at nights. Then she made her take the champagne and flowers\r\nback with her. \u201CTell Monsieur Lebigre,\u201D said she, \u201Cthat he\u2019s not to\r\nsend you here again. It quite vexes me to see you coming here so\r\nmeekly, with your bottles under your arms.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, he wishes me to come,\u201D replied Rose, as she went away. \u201CIt is\r\nwrong of you to distress him. He is a very handsome man.\u201D\r\n\r\nLa Normande, however, was quite conquered by Florent\u2019s affectionate\r\nnature. She continued to follow Muche\u2019s lessons of an evening in the\r\nlamplight, indulging the while in a dream of marrying this man who was\r\nso kind to children. She would still keep her fish stall, while he\r\nwould doubtless rise to a position of importance in the administrative\r\nstaff of the markets. This dream of hers, however, was scarcely\r\nfurthered by the tutor\u2019s respectful bearing towards her. He bowed to\r\nher, and kept himself at a distance, when she have liked to laugh with\r\nhim, and love him as she knew how to love. But it was just this covert\r\nresistance on Florent\u2019s part which continually brought her back to the\r\ndream of marrying him. She realised that he lived in a loftier sphere\r\nthan her own; and by becoming his wife she imagined that her vanity\r\nwould reap no little satisfaction.\r\n\r\nShe was greatly surprised when she learned the history of the man she\r\nloved. He had never mentioned a word of those things to her; and she\r\nscolded him about it. His extraordinary adventures only increased her\r\ntenderness for him, and for evenings together she made him relate all\r\nthat had befallen him. She trembled with fear lest the police should\r\ndiscover him; but he reassured her, saying that the matter was now too\r\nold for the police to trouble their heads about it. One evening he told\r\nher of the woman on the Boulevard Montmartre, the woman in the pink\r\nbonnet, whose blood had dyed his hands. He still frequently thought of\r\nthat poor creature. His anguish-stricken mind had often dwelt upon her\r\nduring the clear nights he had passed in Cayenne; and he had returned\r\nto France with a wild dream of meeting her again on some footway in the\r\nbright sunshine, even though he could still feel her corpse-like weight\r\nacross his legs. And yet, he thought, she might perhaps have recovered.\r\nAt times he received quite a shock while he was walking through the\r\nstreets, on fancying that he recognised her; and he followed pink\r\nbonnets and shawl-draped shoulders with a wildly beating heart. When he\r\nclosed his eyes he could see her walking, and advancing towards him;\r\nbut she let her shawl slip down, showing the two red stains on her\r\nchemisette; and then he saw that her face was pale as wax, and that her\r\neyes were blank, and her lips distorted by pain. For a long time he\r\nsuffered from not knowing her name, from being forced to look upon her\r\nas a mere shadow, whose recollection filled him with sorrow. Whenever\r\nany idea of woman crossed his mind it was always she that rose up\r\nbefore him, as the one pure, tender wife. He often found himself\r\nfancying that she might be looking for him on that boulevard where she\r\nhad fallen dead, and that if she had met him a few seconds sooner she\r\nwould have given him a life of joy. And he wished for no other wife;\r\nnone other existed for him. When he spoke of her, his voice trembled to\r\nsuch a degree that La Normande, her wits quickened by her love, guessed\r\nhis secret, and felt jealous.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, it\u2019s really much better that you shouldn\u2019t see her again,\u201D she\r\nsaid maliciously. \u201CShe can\u2019t look particularly nice by this time.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent turned pale with horror at the vision which these words evoked.\r\nHis love was rotting in her grave. He could not forgive La Normande\u2019s\r\nsavage cruelty, which henceforth made him see the grinning jaws and\r\nhollow eyes of a skeleton within that lovely pink bonnet. Whenever the\r\nfish-girl tried to joke with him on the subject he turned quite angry,\r\nand silenced her with almost coarse language.\r\n\r\nThat, however, which especially surprised the beautiful Norman in these\r\nrevelations was the discovery that she had been quite mistaken in\r\nsupposing that she was enticing a lover away from handsome Lisa. This\r\nso diminished her feeling of triumph, that for a week or so her love\r\nfor Florent abated. She consoled herself, however, with the story of\r\nthe inheritance, no longer calling Lisa a strait-laced prude, but a\r\nthief who kept back her brother-in-law\u2019s money, and assumed\r\nsanctimonious airs to deceive people. Every evening, while Muche took\r\nhis writing lesson, the conversation turned upon old Gradelle\u2019s\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid anyone ever hear of such an idea?\u201D the fish-girl would exclaim,\r\nwith a laugh. \u201CDid the old man want to salt his money, since he put it\r\nin a salting-tub? Eighty-five thousand francs! That\u2019s a nice sum of\r\nmoney! And, besides, the Quenus, no doubt, lied about it\u2014there was\r\nperhaps two or three times as much. Ah, if I were in your place, I\r\nshouldn\u2019t lose any time about claiming my share; indeed I shouldn\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve no need of anything,\u201D was Florent\u2019s invariable answer. \u201CI\r\nshouldn\u2019t know what to do with the money if I had it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, you\u2019re no man!\u201D cried La Normande, losing all control over\r\nherself. \u201CIt\u2019s pitiful! Can\u2019t you see that the Quenus are laughing at\r\nyou? That great fat thing passes all her husband\u2019s old clothes over to\r\nyou. I\u2019m not saying this to hurt your feelings, but everybody makes\r\nremarks about it. Why, the whole neighbourhood has seen the greasy pair\r\nof trousers, which you\u2019re now wearing, on your brother\u2019s legs for three\r\nyears and more! If I were in your place I\u2019d throw their dirty rags in\r\ntheir faces, and insist upon my rights. Your share comes to forty-two\r\nthousand five hundred francs, doesn\u2019t it? Well, I shouldn\u2019t go out of\r\nthe place till I\u2019d got forty-two thousand five hundred francs.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was useless for Florent to explain to her that his sister-in-law had\r\noffered to pay him his share, that she was taking care of it for him,\r\nand that it was he himself who had refused to receive it. He entered\r\ninto the most minute particulars, seeking to convince her of the\r\nQuenus\u2019 honesty, but she sarcastically replied: \u201COh, yes, I dare say! I\r\nknow all about their honesty. That fat thing folds it up every morning\r\nand puts it away in her wardrobe for fear it should get soiled. Really,\r\nI quite pity you, my poor friend. It\u2019s easy to gull you, for you can\u2019t\r\nsee any further than a child of five. One of these days she\u2019ll simply\r\nput your money in her pocket, and you\u2019ll never look on it again. Shall\r\nI go, now, and claim your share for you, just to see what she says?\r\nThere\u2019d be some fine fun, I can tell you! I\u2019d either have the money, or\r\nI\u2019d break everything in the house\u2014I swear I would!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, it\u2019s no business of yours,\u201D Florent replied, quite alarmed.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll see about it; I may possibly be wanting some money soon.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this La Normande assumed an air of doubt, shrugged her shoulders,\r\nand told him that he was really too chicken-hearted. Her one great aim\r\nnow was to embroil him with the Quenu-Gradelles, and she employed every\r\nmeans she could think of to effect her purpose, both anger and banter,\r\nas well as affectionate tenderness. She also cherished another design.\r\nWhen she had succeeded in marrying Florent, she would go and administer\r\na sound cuffing to beautiful Lisa, if the latter did not yield up the\r\nmoney. As she lay awake in her bed at night she pictured every detail\r\nof the scene. She saw herself sitting down in the middle of the pork\r\nshop in the busiest part of the day, and making a terrible fuss. She\r\nbrooded over this idea to such an extent, it obtained such a hold upon\r\nher, that she would have been willing to marry Florent simply in order\r\nto be able to go and demand old Gradelle\u2019s forty-two thousand five\r\nhundred francs.\r\n\r\nOld Madame Mehudin, exasperated by La Normande\u2019s dismissal of Monsieur\r\nLebigre, proclaimed everywhere that her daughter was mad, and that the\r\n\u201Clong spindle-shanks\u201D must have administered some insidious drug to\r\nher. When she learned the Cayenne story, her anger was terrible. She\r\ncalled Florent a convict and murderer, and said it was no wonder that\r\nhis villainy had kept him lank and flat. Her versions of Florent\u2019s\r\nbiography were the most horrible of all that were circulated in the\r\nneighbourhood. At home she kept a moderately quiet tongue in her head,\r\nand restricted herself to muttered indignation, and a show of locking\r\nup the drawer where the silver was kept whenever Florent arrived. One\r\nday, however, after a quarrel with her elder daughter, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\u201CThings can\u2019t go on much longer like this! It is that vile man who is\r\nsetting you against me. Take care that you don\u2019t try me too far, or\r\nI\u2019ll go and denounce him to the police. I will, as true as I stand\r\nhere!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll denounce him!\u201D echoed La Normande, trembling violently, and\r\nclenching her fists. \u201CYou\u2019d better not! Ah, if you weren\u2019t my mother\u2014\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this, Claire, who was a spectator of the quarrel, began to laugh,\r\nwith a nervous laughter that seemed to rasp her throat. For some time\r\npast she had been gloomier and more erratic than ever, invariably\r\nshowing red eyes and a pale face.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, what would you do?\u201D she asked. \u201CWould you give her a cuffing?\r\nPerhaps you\u2019d like to give me, your sister, one as well? I dare say it\r\nwill end in that. But I\u2019ll clear the house of him. I\u2019ll go to the\r\npolice to save mother the trouble.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as La Normande almost choked with the angry threats that rose to\r\nher throat, the younger girl added: \u201CI\u2019ll spare you the exertion of\r\nbeating me. I\u2019ll throw myself into the river as I come back over the\r\nbridge.\u201D\r\n\r\nBig tears were streaming from her eyes; and she rushed off to her\r\nbedroom, banging the doors violently behind her. Old Madame Mehudin\r\nsaid nothing more about denouncing Florent. Muche, however, told La\r\nNormande that he met his grandma talking with Monsieur Lebigre in every\r\ncorner of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between the beautiful Norman and the beautiful Lisa now\r\nassumed a less aggressive but more disturbing character. In the\r\nafternoon, when the red-striped canvas awning was drawn down in front\r\nof the pork shop, the fish-girl would remark that the big fat thing\r\nfelt afraid, and was concealing herself. She was also much exasperated\r\nby the occasional lowering of the window-blind, on which was pictured a\r\nhunting-breakfast in a forest glade, with ladies and gentlemen in\r\nevening dress partaking of a red pasty, as big as themselves, on the\r\nyellow grass.\r\n\r\nBeautiful Lisa, however, was by no means afraid. As soon as the sun\r\nbegan to sink she drew up the blind; and, as she sat knitting behind\r\nher counter, she serenely scanned the market square, where numerous\r\nurchins were poking about in the soil under the gratings which\r\nprotected the roots of the plane-trees, while porters smoked their\r\npipes on the benches along the footway, at either end of which was an\r\nadvertisement column covered with theatrical posters, alternately\r\ngreen, yellow, red, and blue, like some harlequin\u2019s costume. And while\r\npretending to watch the passing vehicles, Lisa would really be\r\nscrutinising the beautiful Norman. She might occasionally be seen\r\nbending forward, as though her eyes were following the Bastille and\r\nPlace Wagram omnibus to the Pointe Saint Eustache, where it always\r\nstopped for a time. But this was only a manoeuvre to enable her to get\r\na better view of the fish-girl, who, as a set-off against the blind,\r\nretorted by covering her head and fish with large sheets of brown\r\npaper, on the pretext of warding off the rays of the setting sun. The\r\nadvantage at present was on Lisa\u2019s side, for as the time for striking\r\nthe decisive blow approached she manifested the calmest serenity of\r\nbearing, whereas her rival, in spite of all her efforts to attain the\r\nsame air of distinction, always lapsed into some piece of gross\r\nvulgarity, which she afterwards regretted. La Normande\u2019s ambition was\r\nto look \u201Clike a lady.\u201D Nothing irritated her more than to hear people\r\nextolling the good manners of her rival. This weak point of hers had\r\nnot escaped old Madame Mehudin\u2019s observation, and she now directed all\r\nher attacks upon it.\r\n\r\n\u201CI saw Madame Quenu standing at her door this evening,\u201D she would say\r\nsometimes. \u201CIt is quite amazing how well she wears. And she\u2019s so\r\nrefined-looking, too; quite the lady, indeed. It\u2019s the counter that\r\ndoes it, I\u2019m sure. A fine counter gives a woman such a respectable\r\nlook.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn this remark there was a veiled allusion to Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s\r\nproposal. The beautiful Norman would make no reply; but for a moment or\r\ntwo she would seem deep in thought. In her mind\u2019s eye she saw herself\r\nbehind the counter of the wine shop at the other corner of the street,\r\nforming a pendent, as it were, to beautiful Lisa. It was this that\r\nfirst shook her love for Florent.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, it was now becoming a very difficult thing to defend\r\nFlorent. The whole neighbourhood was in arms against him; it seemed as\r\nthough everyone had an immediate interest in exterminating him. Some of\r\nthe market people swore that he had sold himself to the police; while\r\nothers asserted that he had been seen in the butter-cellar, attempting\r\nto make holes in the wire grating, with the intention of tossing\r\nlighted matches through them. There was a vast increase of slander, a\r\nperfect flood of abuse, the source of which could not be exactly\r\ndetermined. The fish pavilion was the last one to join in the revolt\r\nagainst the inspector. The fish-wives liked Florent on account of his\r\ngentleness, and for some time they defended him; but, influenced by the\r\nstallkeepers of the butter and fruit pavilions, they at last gave way.\r\nThen hostilities began afresh between these huge, swelling women and\r\nthe lean and lank inspector. He was lost in the whirl of the voluminous\r\npetticoats and buxom bodices which surged furiously around his scraggy\r\nshoulders. However, he understood nothing, but pursued his course\r\ntowards the realisation of his one haunting idea.\r\n\r\nAt every hour of the day, and in every corner of the market,\r\nMademoiselle Saget\u2019s black bonnet was now to be seen in the midst of\r\nthis outburst of indignation. Her little pale face seemed to multiply.\r\nShe had sworn a terrible vengeance against the company which assembled\r\nin Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s little cabinet. She accused them of having\r\ncirculated the story that she lived on waste scraps of meat. The truth\r\nwas that old Gavard had told the others one evening that the \u201Cold\r\nnanny-goat\u201D who came to play the spy upon them gorged herself with the\r\nfilth which the Bonapartist clique tossed away. Clemence felt quite ill\r\non hearing this, and Robine hurriedly gulped down a draught of beer, as\r\nthough to wash his throat. In Gavard\u2019s opinion, the scraps of meat left\r\non the Emperor\u2019s plate were so much political ordure, the putrid\r\nremnants of all the filth of the reign. Thenceforth the party at\r\nMonsieur Lebigre\u2019s looked on Mademoiselle Saget as a creature whom no\r\none could touch except with tongs. She was regarded as some unclean\r\nanimal that battened upon corruption. Clemence and Gavard circulated\r\nthe story so freely in the markets that the old maid found herself\r\nseriously injured in her intercourse with the shopkeepers, who\r\nunceremoniously bade her go off to the scrap-stalls when she came to\r\nhaggle and gossip at their establishments without the least intention\r\nof buying anything. This cut her off from her sources of information;\r\nand sometimes she was altogether ignorant of what was happening. She\r\nshed tears of rage, and in one such moment of anger she bluntly said to\r\nLa Sarriette and Madame Lec\u0153ur: \u201CYou needn\u2019t give me any more hints:\r\nI\u2019ll settle your Gavard\u2019s hash for him now\u2014that I will!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe two women were rather startled, but refrained from all\r\nprotestation. The next day, however, Mademoiselle Saget had calmed\r\ndown, and again expressed much tender-hearted pity for that poor\r\nMonsieur Gavard who was so badly advised, and was certainly hastening\r\nto his ruin.\r\n\r\nGavard was undoubtedly compromising himself. Ever since the conspiracy\r\nhad begun to ripen he had carried the revolver, which caused Madame\r\nLeonce so much alarm, in his pocket wherever he went. It was a big,\r\nformidable-looking weapon, which he had bought of the principal\r\ngunmaker in Paris. He exhibited it to all the women in the poultry\r\nmarket, like a schoolboy who has got some prohibited novel hidden in\r\nhis desk. First he would allow the barrel to peer out of his pocket,\r\nand call attention to it with a wink. Then he affected a mysterious\r\nreticence, indulged in vague hints and insinuations\u2014played, in short,\r\nthe part of a man who revelled in feigning fear. The possession of this\r\nrevolver gave him immense importance, placed him definitely amongst the\r\ndangerous characters of Paris. Sometimes, when he was safe inside his\r\nstall, he would consent to take it out of his pocket, and exhibit it to\r\ntwo or three of the women. He made them stand before him so as to\r\nconceal him with their petticoats, and then he brandished the weapon,\r\ncocked the lock, caused the breech to revolve, and took aim at one of\r\nthe geese or turkeys that were hanging in the stall. He was immensely\r\ndelighted at the alarm manifested by the women; but eventually\r\nreassured them by stating that the revolver was not loaded. However, he\r\ncarried a supply of cartridges about with him, in a case which he\r\nopened with the most elaborate precautions. When he had allowed his\r\nfriends to feel the weight of the cartridges, he would again place both\r\nweapon and ammunition in his pockets. And afterwards, crossing his arms\r\nover his breast, he would chatter away jubilantly for hours.\r\n\r\n\u201CA man\u2019s a man when he\u2019s got a weapon like that,\u201D he would say with a\r\nswaggering air. \u201CI don\u2019t care a fig now for the gendarmes. A friend and\r\nI went to try it last Sunday on the plain of Saint Denis. Of course,\r\nyou know, a man doesn\u2019t tell everyone that he\u2019s got a plaything of that\r\nsort. But, ah! my dears, we fired at a tree, and hit it every time. Ah,\r\nyou\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll see. You\u2019ll hear of Anatole one of these days, I can\r\ntell you.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe had bestowed the name of Anatole upon the revolver; and he carried\r\nthings so far that in a week\u2019s time both weapon and cartridges were\r\nknown to all the women in the pavilion. His friendship for Florent\r\nseemed to them suspicious; he was too sleek and rich to be visited with\r\nthe hatred that was manifested towards the inspector; still, he lost\r\nthe esteem of the shrewder heads amongst his acquaintances, and\r\nsucceeded in terrifying the timid ones. This delighted him immensely.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is very imprudent for a man to carry firearms about with him,\u201D said\r\nMademoiselle Saget. \u201CMonsieur Gavard\u2019s revolver will end by playing him\r\na nasty trick.\u201D\r\n\r\nGavard now showed the most jubilant bearing at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s.\r\nFlorent, since ceasing to take his meals with the Quenus, had come\r\nalmost to live in the little \u201Ccabinet.\u201D He breakfasted, dined, and\r\nconstantly shut himself up there. In fact he had converted the place\r\nalmost into a sort of private room of his own, where he left his old\r\ncoats and books and papers lying about. Monsieur Lebigre had offered no\r\nobjection to these proceedings; indeed, he had even removed one of the\r\ntables to make room for a cushioned bench, on which Florent could have\r\nslept had he felt so inclined. When the inspector manifested any\r\nscruples about taking advantage of Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s kindness, the\r\nlatter told him to do as he pleased, saying that the whole house was at\r\nhis service. Logre also manifested great friendship for him, and even\r\nconstituted himself his lieutenant. He was constantly discussing\r\naffairs with him, rendering an account of the steps he was supposed to\r\ntake, and furnishing the names of newly affiliated associates. Logre,\r\nindeed, had now assumed the duties of organiser; on him rested the task\r\nof bringing the various plotters together, forming the different\r\nsections, and weaving each mesh of the gigantic net into which Paris\r\nwas to fall at a given signal. Florent meantime remained the leader,\r\nthe soul of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nHowever, much as the hunchback seemed to toil, he attained no\r\nappreciable result. Although he had loudly asserted that in each\r\ndistrict of Paris he knew two or three groups of men as determined and\r\ntrustworthy as those who met at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, he had never yet\r\ngiven any precise information about them, but had merely mentioned a\r\nname here and there, and recounted stories of endless alleged secret\r\nexpeditions, and the wonderful enthusiasm that the people manifested\r\nfor the cause. He made a great point of the hand-grasps he had\r\nreceived. So-and-so, whom he thou\u2019d and thee\u2019d, had squeezed his\r\nfingers and declared he would join them. At the Gros Caillou a big,\r\nburly fellow, who would make a magnificent sectional leader, had almost\r\ndislocated his arm in his enthusiasm; while in the Rue Popincourt a\r\nwhole group of working men had embraced him. He declared that at a\r\nday\u2019s notice a hundred thousand active supporters could be gathered\r\ntogether. Each time that he made his appearance in the little room,\r\nwearing an exhausted air, and dropping with apparent fatigue on the\r\nbench, he launched into fresh variations of his usual reports, while\r\nFlorent duly took notes of what he said, and relied on him to realise\r\nhis many promises. And soon in Florent\u2019s pockets the plot assumed life.\r\nThe notes were looked upon as realities, as indisputable facts, upon\r\nwhich the entire plan of the rising was constructed. All that now\r\nremained to be done was to wait for a favourable opportunity, and Logre\r\nasserted with passionate gesticulations that the whole thing would go\r\non wheels.\r\n\r\nFlorent was at last perfectly happy. His feet no longer seemed to tread\r\nthe ground; he was borne aloft by his burning desire to pass sentence\r\non all the wickedness he had seen committed. He had all the credulity\r\nof a little child, all the confidence of a hero. If Logre had told him\r\nthat the Genius of Liberty perched on the Colonne de Juillet[*] would\r\nhave come down and set itself at their head, he would hardly have\r\nexpressed any surprise. In the evenings, at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, he\r\nshowed great enthusiasm and spoke effusively of the approaching battle,\r\nas though it were a festival to which all good and honest folks would\r\nbe invited. But although Gavard in his delight began to play with his\r\nrevolver, Charvet got more snappish than ever, and sniggered and\r\nshrugged his shoulders. His rival\u2019s assumption of the leadership\r\nangered him extremely; indeed, quite disgusted him with politics. One\r\nevening when, arriving early, he happened to find himself alone with\r\nLogre and Lebigre, he frankly unbosomed himself.\r\n\r\n[*] The column erected on the Place de la Bastille in memory of the\r\nRevolution of July 1830, by which Charles X was dethroned.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy,\u201D said he, \u201Cthat fellow Florent hasn\u2019t an idea about politics, and\r\nwould have done far better to seek a berth as writing master in a\r\nladies\u2019 school! It would be nothing short of a misfortune if he were to\r\nsucceed, for, with his visionary social sentimentalities, he would\r\ncrush us down beneath his confounded working men! It\u2019s all that, you\r\nknow, which ruins the party. We don\u2019t need any more tearful\r\nsentimentalists, humanitarian poets, people who kiss and slobber over\r\neach other for the merest scratch. But he won\u2019t succeed! He\u2019ll just get\r\nlocked up, and that will be the end of it.\u201D\r\n\r\nLogre and the wine dealer made no remark, but allowed Charvet to talk\r\non without interruption.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd he\u2019d have been locked up long ago,\u201D he continued, \u201Cif he were\r\nanything as dangerous as he fancies he is. The airs he puts on just\r\nbecause he\u2019s been to Cayenne are quite sickening. But I\u2019m sure that the\r\npolice knew of his return the very first day he set foot in Paris, and\r\nif they haven\u2019t interfered with him it\u2019s simply because they hold him\r\nin contempt.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Logre gave a slight start.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey\u2019ve been dogging me for the last fifteen years,\u201D resumed the\r\nH\u00E9bertist, with a touch of pride, \u201Cbut you don\u2019t hear me proclaiming it\r\nfrom the house-tops. However, he won\u2019t catch me taking part in his\r\nriot. I\u2019m not going to let myself be nabbed like a mere fool. I dare\r\nsay he\u2019s already got half a dozen spies at his heels, who will take him\r\nby the scruff of the neck whenever the authorities give the word.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, dear, no! What an idea!\u201D exclaimed Monsieur Lebigre, who usually\r\nobserved complete silence. He was rather pale, and looked at Logre, who\r\nwas gently rubbing his hump against the partition.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s mere imagination,\u201D murmured the hunchback.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well; call it imagination, if you like,\u201D replied the tutor; \u201Cbut\r\nI know how these things are arranged. At all events, I don\u2019t mean to\r\nlet the \u2018coppers\u2019 nab me this time. You others, of course, will please\r\nyourselves, but if you take my advice\u2014and you especially, Monsieur\r\nLebigre\u2014you\u2019ll take care not to let your establishment be compromised,\r\nor the authorities will close it.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Logre could not restrain a smile. On several subsequent\r\noccasions Charvet plied him and Lebigre with similar arguments, as\r\nthough he wished to detach them from Florent\u2019s project by frightening\r\nthem; and he was much surprised at the calmness and confidence which\r\nthey both continued to manifest. For his own part, he still came pretty\r\nregularly in the evening with Clemence. The tall brunette was no longer\r\na clerk at the fish auctions\u2014Monsieur Manoury had discharged her.\r\n\r\n\u201CThose salesmen are all scoundrels!\u201D Logre growled, when he heard of\r\nher dismissal.\r\n\r\nThereupon Clemence, who, lolling back against the partition, was\r\nrolling a cigarette between her long, slim fingers, replied in a sharp\r\nvoice: \u201COh, it\u2019s fair fighting! We don\u2019t hold the same political views,\r\nyou know. That fellow Manoury, who\u2019s making no end of money, would lick\r\nthe Emperor\u2019s boots. For my part, if I were an auctioneer, I wouldn\u2019t\r\nkeep him in my service for an hour.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe truth was that she had been indulging in some clumsy pleasantry,\r\namusing herself one day by inscribing in the sale-book, alongside of\r\nthe dabs and skate and mackerel sold by auction, the names of some of\r\nthe best-known ladies and gentlemen of the Court. This bestowal of\r\npiscine names upon high dignitaries, these entries of the sale of\r\nduchesses and baronesses at thirty sous apiece, had caused Monsieur\r\nManoury much alarm. Gavard was still laughing over it.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, never mind!\u201D said he, patting Clemence\u2019s arm; \u201Cyou are every\r\ninch a man, you are!\u201D\r\n\r\nClemence had discovered a new method of mixing her grog. She began by\r\nfilling her glass with hot water; and after adding some sugar she\r\npoured the rum drop by drop upon the slice of lemon floating on the\r\nsurface, in such wise that it did not mix with the water. Then she\r\nlighted it and with a grave expression watched it blaze, slowly smoking\r\nher cigarette while the flame of the alcohol cast a greenish tinge over\r\nher face. \u201CGrog,\u201D however, was an expensive luxury in which she could\r\nnot afford to indulge after she had lost her place. Charvet told her,\r\nwith a strained laugh, that she was no longer a millionaire. She\r\nsupported herself by giving French lessons, at a very early hour in the\r\nmorning, to a young lady residing in the Rue de Miromesnil, who was\r\nperfecting her education in secrecy, unknown even to her maid. And so\r\nnow Clemence merely ordered a glass of beer in the evenings, but this\r\nshe drank, it must be admitted, with the most philosophical composure.\r\n\r\nThe evenings in the little sanctum were now far less noisy than they\r\nhad been. Charvet would suddenly lapse into silence, pale with\r\nsuppressed rage, when the others deserted him to listen to his rival.\r\nThe thought that he had been the king of the place, had ruled the whole\r\nparty with despotic power before Florent\u2019s appearance there, gnawed at\r\nhis heart, and he felt all the regretful pangs of a dethroned monarch.\r\nIf he still came to the meetings, it was only because he could not\r\nresist the attraction of the little room where he had spent so many\r\nhappy hours in tyrannising over Gavard and Robine. In those days even\r\nLogre\u2019s hump had been his property, as well as Alexandre\u2019s fleshy arms\r\nand Lacaille\u2019s gloomy face. He had done what he liked with them,\r\nstuffed his opinions down their throats, belaboured their shoulders\r\nwith his sceptre. But now he endured much bitterness of spirit; and\r\nended by quite ceasing to speak, simply shrugging his shoulders and\r\nwhistling disdainfully, without condescending to combat the absurdities\r\nvented in his presence. What exasperated him more than anything else\r\nwas the gradual way in which he had been ousted from his position of\r\npredominance without being conscious of it. He could not see that\r\nFlorent was in any way his superior, and after hearing the latter speak\r\nfor hours, in his gentle and somewhat sad voice, he often remarked:\r\n\u201CWhy, the fellow\u2019s a parson! He only wants a cassock!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe others, however, to all appearance eagerly absorbed whatever the\r\ninspector said. When Charvet saw Florent\u2019s clothes hanging from every\r\npeg, he pretended not to know where he could put his hat so that it\r\nwould not be soiled. He swept away the papers that lay about the little\r\nroom, declaring that there was no longer any comfort for anyone in the\r\nplace since that \u201Cgentleman\u201D had taken possession of it. He even\r\ncomplained to the landlord, and asked if the room belonged to a single\r\ncustomer or to the whole company. This invasion of his realm was indeed\r\nthe last straw. Men were brutes, and he conceived an unspeakable scorn\r\nfor humanity when he saw Logre and Monsieur Lebigre fixing their eyes\r\non Florent with rapt attention. Gavard with his revolver irritated him,\r\nand Robine, who sat silent behind his glass of beer, seemed to him to\r\nbe the only sensible person in the company, and one who doubtless\r\njudged people by their real value, and was not led away by mere words.\r\nAs for Alexandre and Lacaille, they confirmed him in his belief that\r\n\u201Cthe people\u201D were mere fools, and would require at least ten years of\r\nrevolutionary dictatorship to learn how to conduct themselves.\r\n\r\nLogre, however, declared that the sections would soon be completely\r\norganised; and Florent began to assign the different parts that each\r\nwould have to play. One evening, after a final discussion in which he\r\nagain got worsted, Charvet rose up, took his hat, and exclaimed: \u201CWell,\r\nI\u2019ll wish you all good night. You can get your skulls cracked if it\r\namuses you; but I would have you understand that I won\u2019t take any part\r\nin the business. I have never abetted anybody\u2019s ambition.\u201D\r\n\r\nClemence, who had also risen and was putting on her shawl, coldly\r\nadded: \u201CThe plan\u2019s absurd.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as Robine sat watching their departure with a gentle glance,\r\nCharvet asked him if he were not coming with them; but Robine, having\r\nstill some beer left in his glass, contented himself with shaking\r\nhands. Charvet and Clemence never returned again; and Lacaille one day\r\ninformed the company that they now frequented a beer-house in the Rue\r\nSerpente. He had seen them through the window, gesticulating with great\r\nenergy, in the midst of an attentive group of very young men.\r\n\r\nFlorent was never able to enlist Claude amongst his supporters. He had\r\nonce entertained the idea of gaining him over to his own political\r\nviews, of making a disciple of him, an assistant in his revolutionary\r\ntask; and in order to initiate him he had taken him one evening to\r\nMonsieur Lebigre\u2019s. Claude, however, spent the whole time in making a\r\nsketch of Robine, in his hat and chestnut cloak, and with his beard\r\nresting on the knob of his walking-stick.\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, you know,\u201D he said to Florent, as they came away, \u201Call that\r\nyou have been saying inside there doesn\u2019t interest me in the least. It\r\nmay be very clever, but, for my own part, I see nothing in it. Still,\r\nyou\u2019ve got a splendid fellow there, that blessed Robine. He\u2019s as deep\r\nas a well. I\u2019ll come with you again some other time, but it won\u2019t be\r\nfor politics. I shall make sketches of Logre and Gavard, so as to put\r\nthem with Robine in a picture which I was thinking about while you were\r\ndiscussing the question of\u2014what do you call it? eh? Oh, the question of\r\nthe two Chambers. Just fancy, now, a picture of Gavard and Logre and\r\nRobine talking politics, entrenched behind their glasses of beer! It\r\nwould be the success of the Salon, my dear fellow, an overwhelming\r\nsuccess, a genuine modern picture!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent was grieved by the artist\u2019s political scepticism; so he took\r\nhim up to his bedroom, and kept him on the narrow balcony in front of\r\nthe bluish mass of the markets, till two o\u2019clock in the morning,\r\nlecturing him, and telling him that he was no man to show himself so\r\nindifferent to the happiness of his country.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, you\u2019re perhaps right,\u201D replied Claude, shaking his head; \u201CI\u2019m an\r\negotist. I can\u2019t even say that I paint for the good of my country; for,\r\nin the first place, my sketches frighten everybody, and then, when I\u2019m\r\nbusy painting, I think about nothing but the pleasure I take in it.\r\nWhen I\u2019m painting, it is as though I were tickling myself; it makes me\r\nlaugh all over my body. Well, I can\u2019t help it, you know; it\u2019s my nature\r\nto be like that; and you can\u2019t expect me to go and drown myself in\r\nconsequence. Besides, France can get on very well without me, as my\r\naunt Lisa says. And\u2014may I be quite frank with you?\u2014if I like you it\u2019s\r\nbecause you seem to me to follow politics just as I follow painting.\r\nYou titillate yourself, my good friend.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as Florent protested, he continued:\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, yes; you are an artist in your own way; you dream of politics,\r\nand I\u2019ll wager you spend hours here at night gazing at the stars and\r\nimagining they are the voting-papers of infinity. And then you\r\ntitillate yourself with your ideas of truth and justice; and this is so\r\nevidently the case that those ideas of yours cause just as much alarm\r\nto commonplace middle-class folks as my sketches do. Between ourselves,\r\nnow, do you imagine that if you were Robine I should take any pleasure\r\nin your friendship? Ah, no, my friend, you are a great poet!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he began to joke on the subject, saying that politics caused him\r\nno trouble, and that he had got accustomed to hear people discussing\r\nthem in beer shops and studios. This led him to speak of a caf\u00E9 in the\r\nRue Vauvilliers; the caf\u00E9 on the ground-floor of the house where La\r\nSarriette lodged. This smoky place, with its torn, velvet-cushioned\r\nseats, and marble table-tops discoloured by the drippings from\r\ncoffee-cups, was the chief resort of the young people of the markets.\r\nMonsieur Jules reigned there over a company of porters, apprentices,\r\nand gentlemen in white blouses and velvet caps. Two curling \u201CNewgate\r\nknockers\u201D were glued against his temples; and to keep his neck white he\r\nhad it scraped with a razor every Saturday at a hair-dresser\u2019s in the\r\nRue des Deux Ecus. At the caf\u00E9 he gave the tone to his associates,\r\nespecially when he played billiards with studied airs and graces,\r\nshowing off his figure to the best advantage. After the game the\r\ncompany would begin to chat. They were a very reactionary set, taking a\r\ndelight in the doings of \u201Csociety.\u201D For his part, Monsieur Jules read\r\nthe lighter boulevardian newspapers, and knew the performers at the\r\nsmaller theatres, talked familiarly of the celebrities of the day, and\r\ncould always tell whether the piece first performed the previous\r\nevening had been a success or a failure. He had a weakness, however,\r\nfor politics. His ideal man was Morny, as he curtly called him. He read\r\nthe reports of the discussions of the Corps L\u00E9gislatif, and laughed\r\nwith glee over the slightest words that fell from Morny\u2019s lips. Ah,\r\nMorny was the man to sit upon your rascally republicans! And he would\r\nassert that only the scum detested the Emperor, for his Majesty desired\r\nthat all respectable people should have a good time of it.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve been to the caf\u00E9 occasionally,\u201D Claude said to Florent. \u201CThe\r\nyoung men there are vastly amusing, with their clay pipes and their\r\ntalk about the Court balls! To hear them chatter you might almost fancy\r\nthey were invited to the Tuileries. La Sarriette\u2019s young man was making\r\ngreat fun of Gavard the other evening. He called him uncle. When La\r\nSarriette came downstairs to look for him she was obliged to pay his\r\nbill. It cost her six francs, for he had lost at billiards, and the\r\ndrinks they had played for were owing. And now, good night, my friend,\r\nand pleasant dreams. If ever you become a Minister, I\u2019ll give you some\r\nhints on the beautifying of Paris.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent was obliged to relinquish the hope of making a docile disciple\r\nof Claude. This was a source of grief to him, for, blinded though he\r\nwas by his fanatical ardour, he at last grew conscious of the\r\never-increasing hostility which surrounded him. Even at the Mehudins\u2019\r\nhe now met with a colder reception: the old woman would laugh slyly;\r\nMuche no longer obeyed him, and the beautiful Norman cast glances of\r\nhasty impatience at him, unable as she was to overcome his coldness. At\r\nthe Quenus\u2019, too, he had lost Auguste\u2019s friendship. The assistant no\r\nlonger came to see him in his room on the way to bed, being greatly\r\nalarmed by the reports which he heard concerning this man with whom he\r\nhad previously shut himself up till midnight. Augustine had made her\r\nlover swear that he would never again be guilty of such imprudence;\r\nhowever, it was Lisa who turned the young man into Florent\u2019s determined\r\nenemy by begging him and Augustine to defer their marriage till her\r\ncousin should vacate the little bedroom at the top of the house, as she\r\ndid not want to give that poky dressing-room on the first floor to the\r\nnew shop girl whom she would have to engage. From that time forward\r\nAuguste was anxious that the \u201Cconvict\u201D should be arrested. He had found\r\nsuch a pork shop as he had long dreamed of, not at Plaisance certainly,\r\nbut at Montrouge, a little farther away. And now trade had much\r\nimproved, and Augustine, with her silly, overgrown girl\u2019s laugh, said\r\nthat she was quite ready. So every night, whenever some slight noise\r\nawoke him, August was thrilled with delight as he imagined that the\r\npolice were at last arresting Florent.\r\n\r\nNothing was said at the Quenu-Gradelles\u2019 about all the rumours which\r\ncirculated. There was a tacit understanding amongst the staff of the\r\npork shop to keep silent respecting them in the presence of Quenu. The\r\nlatter, somewhat saddened by the falling-out between his brother and\r\nhis wife, sought consolation in stringing his sausages and salting his\r\npork. Sometimes he would come and stand on his door-step, with his red\r\nface glowing brightly above his white apron, which his increasing\r\ncorpulence stretched quite taut, and never did he suspect all the\r\ngossip which his appearance set on foot in the markets. Some of the\r\nwomen pitied him, and thought that he was losing flesh, though he was,\r\nindeed, stouter than ever; while others, on the contrary, reproached\r\nhim for not having grown thin with shame at having such a brother as\r\nFlorent. He, however, like one of those betrayed husbands who are\r\nalways the last to know what has befallen them, continued in happy\r\nignorance, displaying a light-heartedness which was quite affecting. He\r\nwould stop some neighbour\u2019s wife on the footway to ask her if she found\r\nhis brawn or truffled boar\u2019s head to her liking, and she would at once\r\nassume a sympathetic expression, and speak in a condoling way, as\r\nthough all the pork on his premises had got jaundice.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do they all mean by looking at me with such a funereal air?\u201D he\r\nasked Lisa one day. \u201CDo you think I\u2019m looking ill?\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa, well aware that he was terribly afraid of illness, and groaned\r\nand made a dreadful disturbance if he suffered the slightest ailment,\r\nreassured him on this point, telling him that he was as blooming as a\r\nrose. The fine pork shop, however, was becoming gloomy; the mirrors\r\nseemed to pale, the marbles grew frigidly white, and the cooked meats\r\non the counter stagnated in yellow fat or lakes of cloudy jelly. One\r\nday, even, Claude came into the shop to tell his aunt that the display\r\nin the window looked quite \u201Cin the dumps.\u201D This was really the truth.\r\nThe Strasburg tongues on their beds of blue paper-shavings had a\r\nmelancholy whiteness of hue, like the tongues of invalids; and the\r\nwhilom chubby hams seemed to be wasting away beneath their mournful\r\ngreen top-knots. Inside the shop, too, when customers asked for a\r\nblack-pudding or ten sous\u2019 worth of bacon, or half a pound of lard,\r\nthey spoke in subdued, sorrowful voices, as though they were in the\r\nbed-chamber of a dying man. There were always two or three lachrymose\r\nwomen in front of the chilled heating-pan. Beautiful Lisa meantime\r\ndischarged the duties of chief mourner with silent dignity. Her white\r\napron fell more primly than ever over her black dress. Her hands,\r\nscrupulously clean and closely girded at the wrists by long white\r\nsleevelets, her face with its becoming air of sadness, plainly told all\r\nthe neighbourhood, all the inquisitive gossips who streamed into the\r\nshop from morning to night, that they, the Quenu-Gradelles, were\r\nsuffering from unmerited misfortune, but that she knew the cause of it,\r\nand would triumph over it at last. And sometimes she stooped to look at\r\nthe two gold-fish, who also seemed ill at ease as they swam languidly\r\naround the aquarium in the window, and her glance seemed to promise\r\nthem better days in the future.\r\n\r\nBeautiful Lisa now only allowed herself one indulgence. She fearlessly\r\npatted Marjolin\u2019s satiny chin. The young man had just come out of the\r\nhospital. His skull had healed, and he looked as fat and merry as ever;\r\nbut even the little intelligence he had possessed had left him, he was\r\nnow quite an idiot. The gash in his skull must have reached his brain,\r\nfor he had become a mere animal. The mind of a child of five dwelt in\r\nhis sturdy frame. He laughed and stammered, he could no longer\r\npronounce his words properly, and he was as submissively obedient as a\r\nsheep. Cadine took entire possession of him again; surprised, at first,\r\nat the alteration in him, and then quite delighted at having this big\r\nfellow to do exactly as she liked with. He was her doll, her toy, her\r\nslave in all respects but one: she could not prevent him from going off\r\nto Madame Quenu\u2019s every now and then. She thumped him, but he did not\r\nseem to feel her blows; as soon as she had slung her basket round her\r\nneck, and set off to sell her violets in the Rue du Pont Neuf and the\r\nRue de Turbigo, he went to prowl about in front of the pork shop.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome in!\u201D Lisa cried to him.\r\n\r\nShe generally gave him some gherkins, of which he was extremely fond;\r\nand he ate them, laughing in a childish way, whilst he stood in front\r\nof the counter. The sight of the handsome mistress of the shop filled\r\nhim with rapture; he often clapped his hands with joy and began to jump\r\nabout and vent little cries of pleasure, like a child delighted at\r\nsomething shown to it. On the first few occasions when he came to see\r\nher after leaving the hospital Lisa had feared that he might remember\r\nwhat had happened.\r\n\r\n\u201CDoes your head still hurt you?\u201D she asked him.\r\n\r\nBut he swayed about and burst into a merry laugh as he answered no; and\r\nthen Lisa gently inquired: \u201CYou had a fall, hadn\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, a fall, fall, fall,\u201D he sang, in a happy voice, tapping his skull\r\nthe while.\r\n\r\nThen, as though he were in a sort of ecstasy, he continued in lingering\r\nnotes, as he gazed at Lisa, \u201CBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful!\u201D This\r\nquite touched Madame Quenu. She had prevailed upon Gavard to keep him\r\nin his service. It was on the occasions when he so humbly vented his\r\nadmiration that she caressed his chin, and told him that he was a good\r\nlad. He smiled with childish satisfaction, at times closing his eyes\r\nlike some domestic pet fondled by its mistress; and Lisa thought to\r\nherself that she was making him some compensation for the blow with\r\nwhich she had felled him in the cellar of the poultry market.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Quenus\u2019 establishment still remained under a cloud.\r\nFlorent sometimes ventured to show himself, and shook hands with his\r\nbrother, while Lisa observed a frigid silence. He even dined with them\r\nsometimes on Sundays, at long intervals, and Quenu then made great\r\nefforts at gaiety, but could not succeed in imparting any cheerfulness\r\nto the meal. He ate badly, and ended by feeling altogether put out. One\r\nevening, after one of these icy family gatherings, he said to his wife\r\nwith tears in his eyes:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat can be the matter with me? Is it true that I\u2019m not ill? Don\u2019t you\r\nreally see anything wrong in my appearance? I feel just as though I\u2019d\r\ngot a heavy weight somewhere inside me. And I\u2019m so sad and depressed,\r\ntoo, without in the least knowing why. What can it be, do you think?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, a little attack of indigestion, I dare say,\u201D replied Lisa.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no; it\u2019s been going on too long for that; I feel quite crushed\r\ndown. Yet the business is going on all right; I\u2019ve no great worries,\r\nand I am leading just the same steady life as ever. But you, too, my\r\ndear, don\u2019t look well; you seem melancholy. If there isn\u2019t a change for\r\nthe better soon, I shall send for the doctor.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa looked at him with a grave expression.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s no need of a doctor,\u201D she said, \u201Cthings will soon be all right\r\nagain. There\u2019s something unhealthy in the atmosphere just now. All the\r\nneighbourhood is unwell.\u201D Then, as if yielding to an impulse of anxious\r\naffection, she added: \u201CDon\u2019t worry yourself, my dear. I can\u2019t have you\r\nfalling ill; that would be the crowning blow.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs a rule she sent him back to the kitchen, knowing that the noise of\r\nthe choppers, the tuneful simmering of the fat, and the bubbling of the\r\npans had a cheering effect upon him. In this way, too, she kept him at\r\na distance from the indiscreet chatter of Mademoiselle Saget, who now\r\nspent whole mornings in the shop. The old maid seemed bent on arousing\r\nLisa\u2019s alarm, and thus driving her to some extreme step. She began by\r\ntrying to obtain her confidence.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a lot of mischievous folks there are about!\u201D she exclaimed;\r\n\u201Cfolks who would be much better employed in minding their own business.\r\nIf you only knew, my dear Madame Quenu\u2014but no, really, I should never\r\ndare to repeat such things to you.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd, as Madame Quenu replied that she was quite indifferent to gossip,\r\nand that it had no effect upon her, the old maid whispered into her ear\r\nacross the counter: \u201CWell, people say, you know, that Monsieur Florent\r\nisn\u2019t your cousin at all.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she gradually allowed Lisa to see that she knew the whole story;\r\nby way of proving that she had her quite at her mercy. When Lisa\r\nconfessed the truth, equally as a matter of diplomacy, in order that\r\nshe might have the assistance of some one who would keep her well\r\nposted in all the gossip of the neighbourhood, the old maid swore that\r\nfor her own part she would be as mute as a fish, and deny the truth of\r\nthe reports about Florent, even if she were to be led to the stake for\r\nit. And afterwards this drama brought her intense enjoyment; every\r\nmorning she came to the shop with some fresh piece of disturbing news.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must be careful,\u201D she whispered one day; \u201CI have just heard two\r\nwomen in the tripe market talking about you know what. I can\u2019t\r\ninterrupt people and tell them they are lying, you know. It would look\r\nso strange. But the story\u2019s got about, and it\u2019s spreading farther every\r\nday. It can\u2019t be stopped now, I fear; the truth will have to come out.\u201D\r\n\r\nA few days later she returned to the assault in all earnest. She made\r\nher appearance looking quite scared, and waited impatiently till there\r\nwas no one in the shop, when she burst out in her sibilant voice:\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know what people are saying now? Well, they say that all those\r\nmen who meet at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s have got guns, and are going to\r\nbreak out again as they did in \u201848. It\u2019s quite distressing to see such\r\na worthy man as Monsieur Gavard\u2014rich, too, and so respectable\u2014leaguing\r\nhimself with such scoundrels! I was very anxious to let you know, on\r\naccount of your brother-in-law.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, it\u2019s mere nonsense, I\u2019m sure; it can\u2019t be serious,\u201D rejoined Lisa,\r\njust to incite the old maid to tell her more.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot serious, indeed! Why, when one passes along the Rue Pirouette in\r\nthe evening one can hear them screaming out in the most dreadful way.\r\nOh! they make no mystery of it all. You know yourself how they tried to\r\ncorrupt your husband. And the cartridges which I have seen them making\r\nfrom my own window, are they mere nonsense? Well, well, I\u2019m only\r\ntelling you this for your own good.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh! I\u2019m sure of that, and I\u2019m very much obliged to you,\u201D replied Lisa;\r\n\u201Cbut people do invent such stories, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, but this is no invention, unfortunately. The whole neighbourhood\r\nis talking of it. It is said, too, that if the police discover the\r\nmatter there will be a great many people compromised\u2014Monsieur Gavard,\r\nfor instance.\u201D\r\n\r\nMadame Quenu shrugged her shoulders as though to say that Monsieur\r\nGavard was an old fool, and that it would do him good to be locked up.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I merely mention Monsieur Gavard as I might mention any of the\r\nothers, your brother-in-law, for instance,\u201D resumed the old maid with a\r\nwily glance. \u201CYour brother-in-law is the leader, it seems. That\u2019s very\r\nannoying for you, and I\u2019m very sorry indeed; for if the police were to\r\nmake a descent here they might march Monsieur Quenu off as well. Two\r\nbrothers, you know, they\u2019re like two fingers of the same hand.\u201D\r\n\r\nBeautiful Lisa protested against this, but she turned very pale, for\r\nMademoiselle Saget\u2019s last thrust had touched a vulnerable point. From\r\nthat day forward the old maid was ever bringing her stories of innocent\r\npeople who had been thrown into prison for extending hospitality to\r\ncriminal scoundrels. In the evening, when La Saget went to get her\r\nblack-currant syrup at the wine dealer\u2019s, she prepared her budget for\r\nthe next morning. Rose was but little given to gossiping, and the old\r\nmain reckoned chiefly on her own eyes and ears. She had been struck by\r\nMonsieur Lebigre\u2019s extremely kind and obliging manner towards Florent,\r\nhis eagerness to keep him at his establishment, all the polite\r\ncivilities, for which the little money which the other spent in the\r\nhouse could never recoup him. And this conduct of Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s\r\nsurprised her the more as she was aware of the position in which the\r\ntwo men stood in respect to the beautiful Norman.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt looks as though Lebigre were fattening him up for sale,\u201D she\r\nreflected. \u201CWhom can he want to sell him to, I wonder?\u201D\r\n\r\nOne evening when she was in the bar she saw Logre fling himself on the\r\nbench in the sanctum, and heard him speak of his perambulations through\r\nthe faubourgs, with the remark that he was dead beat. She cast a hasty\r\nglance at his feet, and saw that there was not a speck of dust on his\r\nboots. Then she smiled quietly, and went off with her black-currant\r\nsyrup, her lips closely compressed.\r\n\r\nShe used to complete her budget of information on getting back to her\r\nwindow. It was very high up, commanding a view of all the neighbouring\r\nhouses, and proved a source of endless enjoyment to her. She was\r\nconstantly installed at it, as though it were an observatory from which\r\nshe kept watch upon everything that went on in the neighbourhood. She\r\nwas quite familiar with all the rooms opposite her, both on the right\r\nand the left, even to the smallest details of their furniture. She\r\ncould have described, without the least omission, the habits of their\r\ntenants, have related if the latter\u2019s homes were happy or the contrary,\r\nhave told when and how they washed themselves, what they had for\r\ndinner, and who it was that came to see them. Then she obtained a side\r\nview of the markets, and not a woman could walk along the Rue Rambuteau\r\nwithout being seen by her; and she could have correctly stated whence\r\nthe woman had come and whither she was going, what she had got in her\r\nbasket, and, in short, every detail about her, her husband, her\r\nclothes, her children, and her means. \u201CThat\u2019s Madame Loret, over there;\r\nshe\u2019s giving her son a fine education; that\u2019s Madame Hutin, a poor\r\nlittle woman who\u2019s dreadfully neglected by her husband; that\u2019s\r\nMademoiselle Cecile, the butcher\u2019s daughter, a girl that no one will\r\nmarry because she\u2019s scrofulous.\u201D In this way she could have continued\r\njerking out biographical scraps for days together, deriving\r\nextraordinary amusement from the most trivial, uninteresting incidents.\r\nHowever, as soon as eight o\u2019clock struck, she only had eyes for the\r\nfrosted \u201Ccabinet\u201D window on which appeared the black shadows of the\r\ncoterie of politicians. She discovered the secession of Charvet and\r\nClemence by missing their bony silhouettes from the milky transparency.\r\nNot an incident occurred in that room but she sooner or later learnt it\r\nby some sudden motion of those silent arms and heads. She acquired\r\ngreat skill in interpretation, and could divine the meaning of\r\nprotruding noses, spreading fingers, gaping mouths, and shrugging\r\nshoulders; and in this way she followed the progress of the conspiracy\r\nstep by step, in such wise that she could have told day by day how\r\nmatters stood. One evening the terrible outcome of it all was revealed\r\nto her. She saw the shadow of Gavard\u2019s revolver, a huge silhouette with\r\npointed muzzle showing very blackly against the glimmering window. It\r\nkept appearing and disappearing so rapidly that it seemed as though the\r\nroom was full of revolvers. Those were the firearms of which\r\nMademoiselle Saget had spoken to Madame Quenu. On another evening she\r\nwas much puzzled by the sight of endless lengths of some material or\r\nother, and came to the conclusion that the men must be manufacturing\r\ncartridges. The next morning, however, she made her appearance in the\r\nwine shop by eleven o\u2019clock, on the pretext of asking Rose if she could\r\nlet her have a candle, and, glancing furtively into the little sanctum,\r\nshe espied a heap of red material lying on the table. This greatly\r\nalarmed her, and her next budget of news was one of decisive gravity.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t want to alarm you, Madame Quenu,\u201D she said, \u201Cbut matters are\r\nreally looking very serious. Upon my word, I\u2019m quite alarmed. You must\r\non no account repeat what I am going to confide to you. They would\r\nmurder me if they knew I had told you.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, when Lisa had sworn to say nothing that might compromise her, she\r\ntold her about the red material.\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t think what it can be. There was a great heap of it. It looked\r\njust like rags soaked in blood. Logre, the hunchback, you know, put one\r\nof the pieces over his shoulder. He looked like a headsman. You may be\r\nsure this is some fresh trickery or other.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa made no reply, but seemed deep in thought whilst with lowered\r\neyes, she handled a fork and mechanically arranged some piece of salt\r\npork on a dish.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I were you,\u201D resumed Mademoiselle Saget softly, \u201CI shouldn\u2019t be\r\neasy in mind; I should want to know the meaning of it all. Why\r\nshouldn\u2019t you go upstairs and examine your brother-in-law\u2019s bedroom?\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Lisa gave a slight start, let the fork drop, and glanced\r\nuneasily at the old maid, believing that she had discovered her\r\nintentions. But the other continued: \u201CYou would certainly be justified\r\nin doing so. There\u2019s no knowing into what danger your brother-in-law\r\nmay lead you, if you don\u2019t put a check on him. They were talking about\r\nyou yesterday at Madame Taboureau\u2019s. Ah! you have a most devoted friend\r\nin her. Madame Taboureau said that you were much too easy-going, and\r\nthat if she were you she would have put an end to all this long ago.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMadame Taboureau said that?\u201D murmured Lisa thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, indeed she did; and Madame Taboureau is a woman whose advice is\r\nworth listening to. Try to find out the meaning of all those red bands;\r\nand if you do, you\u2019ll tell me, won\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa, however, was no longer listening to her. She was gazing\r\nabstractedly at the edible snails and Gervais cheeses between the\r\nfestoons of sausages in the window. She seemed absorbed in a mental\r\nconflict, which brought two little furrows to her brow. The old maid,\r\nhowever, poked her nose over the dishes on the counter.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, some slices of saveloy!\u201D she muttered, as though she were speaking\r\nto herself. \u201CThey\u2019ll get very dry cut up like that. And that\r\nblack-pudding\u2019s broken, I see\u2014a fork\u2019s been stuck into it, I expect. It\r\nmight be taken away\u2014it\u2019s soiling the dish.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa, still absent-minded, gave her the black-pudding and slices of\r\nsaveloy. \u201CYou may take them,\u201D she said, \u201Cif you would care for them.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe black bag swallowed them up. Mademoiselle Saget was so accustomed\r\nto receiving presents that she had actually ceased to return thanks for\r\nthem. Every morning she carried away all the scraps of the pork shop.\r\nAnd now she went off with the intention of obtaining her dessert from\r\nLa Sarriette and Madame Lec\u0153ur, by gossiping to them about Gavard.\r\n\r\nWhen Lisa was alone again she installed herself on the bench, behind\r\nthe counter, as though she thought she would be able to come to a\r\nsounder decision if she were comfortably seated. For the last week she\r\nhad been very anxious. Florent had asked Quenu for five hundred francs\r\none evening, in the easy, matter-of-course way of a man who had money\r\nlying to his credit at the pork shop. Quenu referred him to his wife.\r\nThis was distasteful to Florent, who felt somewhat uneasy on applying\r\nto beautiful Lisa. But she immediately went up to her bedroom, brought\r\nthe money down and gave it to him, without saying a word, or making the\r\nleast inquiry as to what he intended to do with it. She merely remarked\r\nthat she had made a note of the payment on the paper containing the\r\nparticulars of Florent\u2019s share of the inheritance. Three days later he\r\ntook a thousand francs.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was scarcely worth while trying to make himself out so\r\ndisinterested,\u201D Lisa said to Quenu that night, as they went to bed. \u201CI\r\ndid quite right, you see, in keeping the account. By the way, I haven\u2019t\r\nnoted down the thousand francs I gave him to-day.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe sat down at the secr\u00E9taire, and glanced over the page of figures.\r\nThen she added: \u201CI did well to leave a blank space. I\u2019ll put down what\r\nI pay him on the margin. You\u2019ll see, now, he\u2019ll fritter it all away by\r\ndegrees. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been expecting for a long time past.\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu said nothing, but went to bed feeling very much put out. Every\r\ntime that his wife opened the secr\u00E9taire the drawer gave out a mournful\r\ncreak which pierced his heart. He even thought of remonstrating with\r\nhis brother, and trying to prevent him from ruining himself with the\r\nMehudins; but when the time came, he did not dare to do it. Two days\r\nlater Florent asked for another fifteen hundred francs. Logre had said\r\none evening that things would ripen much faster if they could only get\r\nsome money. The next day he was enchanted to find these words of his,\r\nuttered quite at random, result in the receipt of a little pile of\r\ngold, which he promptly pocketed, sniggering as he did so, and his\r\nhunch fairly shaking with delight. From that time forward money was\r\nconstantly being needed: one section wished to hire a room where they\r\ncould meet, while another was compelled to provide for various needy\r\npatriots. Then there were arms and ammunition to be purchased, men to\r\nbe enlisted, and private police expenses. Florent would have paid for\r\nanything. He had bethought himself of Uncle Gradelle\u2019s treasure, and\r\nrecalled La Normande\u2019s advice. So he made repeated calls upon Lisa\u2019s\r\nsecr\u00E9taire, being merely kept in check by the vague fear with which his\r\nsister-in-law\u2019s grave face inspired him. Never, thought he, could he\r\nhave spent his money in a holier cause. Logre now manifested the\r\ngreatest enthusiasm, and wore the most wonderful rose-coloured\r\nneckerchiefs and the shiniest of varnished boots, the sight of which\r\nmade Lacaille glower blackly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat makes three thousand francs in seven days,\u201D Lisa remarked to\r\nQuenu. \u201CWhat do you think of that? A pretty state of affairs, isn\u2019t it?\r\nIf he goes on at this rate his fifty thousand francs will last him\r\nbarely four months. And yet it took old Gradelle forty years to put his\r\nfortune together!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s all your own fault!\u201D cried Quenu. \u201CThere was no occasion for you\r\nto say anything to him about the money.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa gave her husband a severe glance. \u201CIt is his own,\u201D she said; \u201Cand\r\nhe is entitled to take it all. It\u2019s not the giving him the money that\r\nvexes me, but the knowledge that he must make a bad use of it. I tell\r\nyou again, as I have been telling you for a long time past, all this\r\nmust come to an end.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo whatever you like; I won\u2019t prevent you,\u201D at last exclaimed the pork\r\nbutcher, who was tortured by his cupidity.\r\n\r\nHe still loved his brother; but the thought of fifty thousand francs\r\nsquandered in four months was agony to him. As for his wife, after all\r\nMademoiselle Saget\u2019s chattering she guessed what became of the money.\r\nThe old maid having ventured to refer to the inheritance, Lisa had\r\ntaken advantage of the opportunity to let the neighbourhood know that\r\nFlorent was drawing his share, and spending it after his own fashion.\r\n\r\nIt was on the following day that the story of the strips of red\r\nmaterial impelled Lisa to take definite action. For a few moments she\r\nremained struggling with herself whilst gazing at the depressed\r\nappearance of the shop. The sides of pork hung all around in a sullen\r\nfashion, and Mouton, seated beside a bowl of fat, displayed the ruffled\r\ncoat and dim eyes of a cat who no longer digests his meals in peace.\r\nThereupon Lisa called to Augustine and told her to attend to the\r\ncounter, and she herself went up to Florent\u2019s room.\r\n\r\nWhen she entered it, she received quite a shock. The bed, hitherto so\r\nspotless, was quite ensanguined by a bundle of long red scarves\r\ndangling down to the floor. On the mantelpiece, between the gilt\r\ncardboard boxes and the old pomatum-pots, were several red armlets and\r\nclusters of red cockades, looking like pools of blood. And hanging from\r\nevery nail and peg against the faded grey wallpaper were pieces of\r\nbunting, square flags\u2014yellow, blue, green, and black\u2014in which Lisa\r\nrecognised the distinguishing banners of the twenty sections. The\r\nchildish simplicity of the room seemed quite scared by all this\r\nrevolutionary decoration. The aspect of guileless stupidity which the\r\nshop girl had left behind her, the white innocence of the curtains and\r\nfurniture, now glared as with the reflection of a fire; while the\r\nphotograph of Auguste and Augustine looked white with terror. Lisa\r\nwalked round the room, examining the flags, the armlets, and the\r\nscarves, without touching any of them, as though she feared that the\r\ndreadful things might burn her. She was reflecting that she had not\r\nbeen mistaken, that it was indeed on these and similar things that\r\nFlorent\u2019s money had been spent. And to her this seemed an utter\r\nabomination, an incredibility which set her whole being surging with\r\nindignation. To think that her money, that money which had been so\r\nhonestly earned, was being squandered to organise and defray the\r\nexpenses of an insurrection!\r\n\r\nShe stood there, gazing at the expanded blossoms of the pomegranate on\r\nthe balcony\u2014blossoms which seemed to her like an additional supply of\r\ncrimson cockades\u2014and listening to the sharp notes of the chaffinch,\r\nwhich resembled the echo of a distant fusillade. And then it struck her\r\nthat the insurrection might break out the next day, or perhaps that\r\nvery evening. She fancied she could see the banners streaming in the\r\nair and the scarves advancing in line, while a sudden roll of drums\r\nbroke on her ear. Then she hastily went downstairs again, without even\r\nglancing at the papers which were lying on the table. She stopped on\r\nthe first floor, went into her own room, and dressed herself.\r\n\r\nIn this critical emergency Lisa arranged her hair with scrupulous care\r\nand perfect calmness. She was quite resolute; not a quiver of\r\nhesitation disturbed her; but a sterner expression than usual had come\r\ninto her eyes. As she fastened her black silk dress, straining the\r\nwaistband with all the strength of her fingers, she recalled Abb\u00E9\r\nRoustan\u2019s words; and she questioned herself, and her conscience\r\nanswered that she was going to fulfil a duty. By the time she drew her\r\nbroidered shawl round her broad shoulders, she felt that she was about\r\nto perform a deed of high morality. She put on a pair of dark mauve\r\ngloves, secured a thick veil to her bonnet; and before leaving the room\r\nshe double-locked the secr\u00E9taire, with a hopeful expression on her face\r\nwhich seemed to say that that much worried piece of furniture would at\r\nlast be able to sleep in peace again.\r\n\r\nQuenu was exhibiting his white paunch at the shop door when his wife\r\ncame down. He was surprised to see her going out in full dress at ten\r\no\u2019clock in the morning. \u201CHallo! Where are you off to?\u201D he asked.\r\n\r\nShe pretended that she was going out with Madame Taboureau, and added\r\nthat she would call at the Gait\u00E9 Theatre to buy some tickets. Quenu\r\nhurried after her to tell her to secure some front seats, so that they\r\nmight be able to see well. Then, as he returned to the shop, Lisa made\r\nher way to the cab-stand opposite St. Eustache, got into a cab, pulled\r\ndown the blinds, and told the driver to go to the Gait\u00E9 Theatre. She\r\nfelt afraid of being followed. When she had booked two seats, however,\r\nshe directed the cabman to drive her to the Palais de Justice. There,\r\nin front of the gate, she discharged him, and then quietly made her way\r\nthrough the halls and corridors to the Prefecture of Police.\r\n\r\nShe soon lost herself in a noisy crowd of police officers and gentlemen\r\nin long frock-coats, but at last gave a man half a franc to guide her\r\nto the Prefect\u2019s rooms. She found, however, that the Prefect only\r\nreceived such persons as came with letters of audience; and she was\r\nshown into a small apartment, furnished after the style of a\r\nboarding-house parlour. A fat, bald-headed official, dressed in black\r\nfrom head to foot, received her there with sullen coldness. What was\r\nher business? he inquired. Thereupon she raised her veil, gave her\r\nname, and told her story, clearly and distinctly, without a pause. The\r\nbald man listened with a weary air.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are this man\u2019s sister-in-law, are you not?\u201D he inquired, when she\r\nhad finished.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Lisa candidly replied. \u201CWe are honest, straight-forward people,\r\nand I am anxious that my husband should not be compromised.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe official shrugged his shoulders, as though to say that the whole\r\naffair was a great nuisance.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know,\u201D he said impatiently, \u201Cthat I have been pestered with\r\nthis business for more than a year past? Denunciation after\r\ndenunciation has been sent to me, and I am being continually goaded and\r\npressed to take action. You will understand that if I haven\u2019t done so\r\nas yet, it is because I prefer to wait. We have good reasons for our\r\nconduct in the matter. Stay, now, here are the papers relating to it.\r\nI\u2019ll let you see them.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe laid before her an immense collection of papers in a blue wrapper.\r\nLisa turned them over. They were like detached chapters of the story\r\nshe had just been relating. The commissaires of police at Havre, Rouen,\r\nand Vernon notified Florent\u2019s arrival within their respective\r\njurisdictions. Then came a report which announced that he had taken up\r\nhis residence with the Quenu-Gradelles. Next followed his appointment\r\nat the markets, an account of his mode of life, the spending of his\r\nevenings at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s; not a detail was deficient. Lisa, quite\r\nastounded as she was, noticed that the reports were in duplicate, so\r\nthat they must have emanated from two different sources. And at last\r\nshe came upon a pile of letters, anonymous letters of every shape, and\r\nin every description of handwriting. They brought her amazement to a\r\nclimax. In one letter she recognised the villainous hand of\r\nMademoiselle Saget, denouncing the people who met in the little sanctum\r\nat Lebigre\u2019s. On a large piece of greasy paper she identified the heavy\r\npot-hooks of Madame Lec\u0153ur; and there was also a sheet of cream-laid\r\nnote-paper, ornamented with a yellow pansy, and covered with the\r\nscrawls of La Sarriette and Monsieur Jules. These two letters warned\r\nthe Government to beware of Gavard. Farther on Lisa recognised the\r\ncoarse style of old Madame Mehudin, who in four pages of almost\r\nindecipherable scribble repeated all the wild stories about Florent\r\nthat circulated in the markets. However, what startled her more than\r\nanything else was the discovery of a bill-head of her own\r\nestablishment, with the inscription _Quenu-Gradelle, Pork Butcher_, on\r\nits face, whilst on the back of it Auguste had penned a denunciation of\r\nthe man whom he looked upon as an obstacle to his marriage.\r\n\r\nThe official had acted upon a secret idea in placing these papers\r\nbefore her. \u201CYou don\u2019t recognise any of these handwritings, do you?\u201D he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D she stammered, rising from her seat, quite oppressed by what she\r\nhad just learned; and she hastily pulled down her veil again to conceal\r\nthe blush of confusion which was rising to her cheeks. Her silk dress\r\nrustled, and her dark gloves disappeared beneath her heavy shawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou see, madame,\u201D said the bald man with a faint smile, \u201Cyour\r\ninformation comes a little late. But I promise you that your visit\r\nshall not be forgotten. And tell your husband not to stir. It is\r\npossible that something may happen soon that\u2014\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nHe did not complete his sentence, but, half rising from his armchair,\r\nmade a slight bow to Lisa. It was a dismissal, and she took her leave.\r\nIn the ante-room she caught sight of Logre and Monsieur Lebigre, who\r\nhastily turned their faces away; but she was more disturbed than they\r\nwere. She went her way through the halls and along the corridors,\r\nfeeling as if she were in the clutches of this system of police which,\r\nit now seemed to her, saw and knew everything. At last she came out\r\nupon the Place Dauphine. When she reached the Quai de l\u2019Horloge she\r\nslackened her steps, and felt refreshed by the cool breeze blowing from\r\nthe Seine.\r\n\r\nShe now had a keen perception of the utter uselessness of what she had\r\ndone. Her husband was in no danger whatever; and this thought, whilst\r\nrelieving her, left her a somewhat remorseful feeling. She was\r\nexasperated with Auguste and the women who had put her in such a\r\nridiculous position. She walked on yet more slowly, watching the Seine\r\nas it flowed past. Barges, black with coal-dust, were floating down the\r\ngreenish water; and all along the bank anglers were casting their\r\nlines. After all, it was not she who had betrayed Florent. This\r\nreflection suddenly occurred to her and astonished her. Would she have\r\nbeen guilty of a wicked action, then, if she had been his betrayer? She\r\nwas quite perplexed; surprised at the possibility of her conscience\r\nhaving deceived her. Those anonymous letters seemed extremely base. She\r\nherself had gone openly to the authorities, given her name, and saved\r\ninnocent people from being compromised. Then at the sudden thought of\r\nold Gradelle\u2019s fortune she again examined herself, and felt ready to\r\nthrow the money into the river if such a course should be necessary to\r\nremove the blight which had fallen on the pork shop. No, she was not\r\navaricious, she was sure she wasn\u2019t; it was no thought of money that\r\nhad prompted her in what she had just done. As she crossed the Pont au\r\nChange she grew quite calm again, recovering all her superb equanimity.\r\nOn the whole, it was much better, she felt, that others should have\r\nanticipated her at the Prefecture. She would not have to deceive Quenu,\r\nand she would sleep with an easier conscience.\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you booked the seats?\u201D Quenu asked her when she returned home.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to see the tickets, and made Lisa explain to him the exact\r\nposition the seats occupied in the dress-circle. Lisa had imagined that\r\nthe police would make a descent upon the house immediately after\r\nreceiving her information, and her proposal to go to the theatre had\r\nonly been a wily scheme for getting Quenu out of the way while the\r\nofficers were arresting Florent. She had contemplated taking him for an\r\nouting in the afternoon\u2014one of those little jaunts which they\r\noccasionally allowed themselves. They would then drive in an open cab\r\nto the Bois de Boulogne, dine at a restaurant, and amuse themselves for\r\nan hour or two at some caf\u00E9 concern. But there was no need to go out\r\nnow, she thought; so she spent the rest of the day behind her counter,\r\nwith a rosy glow on her face, and seeming brighter and gayer, as though\r\nshe were recovering from some indisposition.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou see, I told you it was fresh air you wanted!\u201D exclaimed Quenu.\r\n\u201CYour walk this morning has brightened you up wonderfully!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, indeed,\u201D she said after a pause, again assuming her look of\r\nseverity; \u201Cthe streets of Paris are not at all healthy places.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn the evening they went to the Gait\u00E9 to see the performance of \u201CLa\r\nGr\u00E2ce de Dieu.\u201D Quenu, in a frock-coat and drab gloves, with his hair\r\ncarefully pomatumed and combed, was occupied most of the time in\r\nhunting for the names of the performers in the programme. Lisa looked\r\nsuperb in her low dress as she rested her hands in their tight-fitting\r\nwhite gloves on the crimson velvet balustrade. They were both of them\r\ndeeply affected by the misfortunes of Marie. The commander, they\r\nthought, was certainly a desperate villain; while Pierrot made them\r\nlaugh from the first moment of his appearance on the stage. But at last\r\nMadame Quenu cried. The departure of the child, the prayer in the\r\nmaiden\u2019s chamber, the return of the poor mad creature, moistened her\r\neyes with gentle tears, which she brushed away with her handkerchief.\r\n\r\nHowever, the pleasure which the evening afforded her turned into a\r\nfeeling of triumph when she caught sight of La Normande and her mother\r\nsitting in the upper gallery. She thereupon puffed herself out more\r\nthan ever, sent Quenu off to the refreshment bar for a box of caramels,\r\nand began to play with her fan, a mother-of-pearl fan, elaborately\r\ngilt. The fish-girl was quite crushed; and bent her head down to listen\r\nto her mother, who was whispering to her. When the performance was over\r\nand beautiful Lisa and the beautiful Norman met in the vestibule they\r\nexchanged a vague smile.\r\n\r\nFlorent had dined early at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s that day. He was\r\nexpecting Logre, who had promised to introduce to him a retired\r\nsergeant, a capable man, with whom they were to discuss the plan of\r\nattack upon the Palais Bourbon and the H\u00F4tel de Ville. The night closed\r\nin, and the fine rain, which had begun to fall in the afternoon,\r\nshrouded the vast markets in a leaden gloom. They loomed darkly against\r\nthe copper-tinted sky, while wisps of murky cloud skimmed by almost on\r\na level with the roofs, looking as though they were caught and torn by\r\nthe points of the lightning-conductors. Florent felt depressed by the\r\nsight of the muddy streets, and the streaming yellowish rain which\r\nseemed to sweep the twilight away and extinguish it in the mire. He\r\nwatched the crowds of people who had taken refuge on the foot-pavements\r\nof the covered ways, the umbrellas flitting past in the downpour, and\r\nthe cabs that dashed with increased clatter and speed along the\r\nwellnigh deserted roads. Presently there was a rift in the clouds; and\r\na red glow arose in the west. Then a whole army of street-sweepers came\r\ninto sight at the end of the Rue Montmartre, driving a lake of liquid\r\nmud before them with their brooms.\r\n\r\nLogre did not turn up with the sergeant; Gavard had gone to dine with\r\nsome friends at Batignolles, and so Florent was reduced to spending the\r\nevening alone with Robine. He had all the talking to himself, and ended\r\nby feeling very low-spirited. His companion merely wagged his beard,\r\nand stretched out his hand every quarter of an hour to raise his glass\r\nof beer to his lips. At last Florent grew so bored that he went off to\r\nbed. Robine, however, though left to himself, still lingered there,\r\ncontemplating his glass with an expression of deep thought. Rose and\r\nthe waiter, who had hoped to shut up early, as the coterie of\r\npoliticians was absent, had to wait a long half hour before he at last\r\nmade up his mind to leave.\r\n\r\nWhen Florent got to his room, he felt afraid to go to bed. He was\r\nsuffering from one of those nervous attacks which sometimes plunged him\r\ninto horrible nightmares until dawn. On the previous day he had been to\r\nClamart to attend the funeral of Monsieur Verlaque, who had died after\r\nterrible sufferings; and he still felt sad at the recollection of the\r\nnarrow coffin which he had seen lowered into the earth. Nor could he\r\nbanish from his mind the image of Madame Verlaque, who, with a tearful\r\nvoice, though there was not a tear in her eyes, kept following him and\r\nspeaking to him about the coffin, which was not paid for, and of the\r\ncost of the funeral, which she was quite at a loss about, as she had\r\nnot a copper in the place, for the druggist, on hearing of her\r\nhusband\u2019s death on the previous day, had insisted upon his bill being\r\npaid. So Florent had been obliged to advance the money for the coffin\r\nand other funeral expenses, and had even given the gratuities to the\r\nmutes. Just as he was going away, Madame Verlaque looked at him with\r\nsuch a heartbroken expression that he left her twenty francs.\r\n\r\nAnd now Monsieur Verlaque\u2019s death worried him very much. It affected\r\nhis situation in the markets. He might lose his berth, or perhaps be\r\nformally appointed inspector. In either case he foresaw vexatious\r\ncomplications which might arouse the suspicions of the police. He would\r\nhave been delighted if the insurrection could have broken out the very\r\nnext day, so that he might at once have tossed the laced cap of his\r\ninspectorship into the streets. With his mind full of harassing\r\nthoughts like these, he stepped out upon the balcony, as though\r\nsoliciting of the warm night some whiff of air to cool his fevered\r\nbrow. The rain had laid the wind, and a stormy heat still reigned\r\nbeneath the deep blue, cloudless heavens. The markets, washed by the\r\ndownpour, spread out below him, similar in hue to the sky, and, like\r\nthe sky, studded with the yellow stars of their gas lamps.\r\n\r\nLeaning on the iron balustrade, Florent recollected that sooner or\r\nlater he would certainly be punished for having accepted the\r\ninspectorship. It seemed to lie like a stain on his life. He had become\r\nan official of the Prefecture, forswearing himself, serving the Empire\r\nin spite of all the oaths he had taken in his exile. His anxiety to\r\nplease Lisa, the charitable purpose to which he had devoted the salary\r\nhe received, the just and scrupulous manner in which he had always\r\nstruggled to carry out his duties, no longer seemed to him valid\r\nexcuses for his base abandonment of principle. If he had suffered in\r\nthe midst of all that sleek fatness, he had deserved to suffer. And\r\nbefore him arose a vision of the evil year which he had just spent, his\r\npersecution by the fish-wives, the sickening sensations he had felt on\r\nclose, damp days, the continuous indigestion which had afflicted his\r\ndelicate stomach, and the latent hostility which was gathering strength\r\nagainst him. All these things he now accepted as chastisement. That\r\ndull rumbling of hostility and spite, the cause of which he could not\r\ndivine, must forebode some coming catastrophe before whose approach he\r\nalready stooped, with the shame of one who knows there is a\r\ntransgression that he must expiate. Then he felt furious with himself\r\nas he thought of the popular rising he was preparing; and reflected\r\nthat he was no longer unsullied enough to achieve success.\r\n\r\nIn how many dreams he had indulged in that lofty little room, with his\r\neyes wandering over the spreading roofs of the market pavilions! They\r\nusually appeared to him like grey seas that spoke to him of far-off\r\ncountries. On moonless nights they would darken and turn into stagnant\r\nlakes of black and pestilential water. But on bright nights they became\r\nshimmering fountains of light, the moonbeams streaming over both tiers\r\nlike water, gliding along the huge plates of zinc, and flowing over the\r\nedges of the vast superposed basins. Then frosty weather seemed to turn\r\nthese roofs into rigid ice, like the Norwegian bays over which skaters\r\nskim; while the warm June nights lulled them into deep sleep. One\r\nDecember night, on opening his window, he had seen them white with\r\nsnow, so lustrously white that they lighted up the coppery sky.\r\nUnsullied by a single footstep, they then stretched out like the lonely\r\nplains of the Far North, where never a sledge intrudes. Their silence\r\nwas beautiful, their soft peacefulness suggestive of innocence.\r\n\r\nAnd at each fresh aspect of the ever-changing panorama before him,\r\nFlorent yielded to dreams which were now sweet, now full of bitter\r\npain. The snow calmed him; the vast sheet of whiteness seemed to him\r\nlike a veil of purity thrown over the filth of the markets. The bright,\r\nclear nights, the shimmering moonbeams, carried him away into the\r\nfairy-land of story-books. It was only the dark, black nights, the\r\nburning nights of June, when he beheld, as it were, a miasmatic marsh,\r\nthe stagnant water of a dead and accursed sea, that filled him with\r\ngloom and grief; and then ever the same dreadful visions haunted his\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nThe markets were always there. He could never open the window and rest\r\nhis elbows on the balustrade without having them before him, filling\r\nthe horizon. He left the pavilions in the evening only to behold their\r\nendless roofs as he went to bed. They shut him off from the rest of\r\nParis, ceaselessly intruded their huge bulk upon him, entered into\r\nevery hour of his life. That night again horrible fancies came to him,\r\nfancies aggravated by the vague forebodings of evil which distressed\r\nhim. The rain of the afternoon had filled the markets with malodorous\r\ndampness, and as they wallowed there in the centre of the city, like\r\nsome drunken man lying, after his last bottle, under the table, they\r\ncast all their foul breath into his face. He seemed to see a thick\r\nvapour rising up from each pavilion. In the distance the meat and tripe\r\nmarkets reeked with the sickening steam of blood; nearer in, the\r\nvegetable and fruit pavilions diffused the odour of pungent cabbages,\r\nrotten apples, and decaying leaves; the butter and cheese exhaled a\r\npoisonous stench; from the fish market came a sharp, fresh gust; while\r\nfrom the ventilator in the tower of the poultry pavilion just below\r\nhim, he could see a warm steam issuing, a fetid current rising in coils\r\nlike the sooty smoke from a factory chimney. And all these exhalations\r\ncoalesced above the roofs, drifted towards the neighbouring houses, and\r\nspread themselves out in a heavy cloud which stretched over the whole\r\nof Paris. It was as though the markets were bursting within their tight\r\nbelt of iron, were beating the slumber of the gorged city with the\r\nstertorous fumes of their midnight indigestion.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the footway down below Florent presently heard a sound of\r\nvoices, the laughter of happy folks. Then the door of the passage was\r\nclosed noisily. It was Quenu and Lisa coming home from the theatre.\r\nStupefied and intoxicated, as it were, by the atmosphere he was\r\nbreathing, Florent thereupon left the balcony, his nerves still\r\npainfully excited by the thought of the tempest which he could feel\r\ngathering round his head. The source of his misery was yonder, in those\r\nmarkets, heated by the day\u2019s excesses. He closed the window with\r\nviolence, and left them wallowing in the darkness, naked and perspiring\r\nbeneath the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nA week later, Florent thought that he would at last be able to proceed\r\nto action. A sufficiently serious outburst of public dissatisfaction\r\nfurnished an opportunity for launching his insurrectionary forces upon\r\nParis. The Corps L\u00E9gislatif, whose members had lately shown great\r\nvariance of opinion respecting certain grants to the Imperial family,\r\nwas now discussing a bill for the imposition of a very unpopular tax,\r\nat which the lower orders had already begun to growl. The Ministry,\r\nfearing a defeat, was straining every nerve. It was probable, thought\r\nFlorent, that no better pretext for a rising would for a long time\r\npresent itself.\r\n\r\nOne morning, at daybreak, he went to reconnoitre the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Palais Bourbon. He forgot all about his duties as inspector, and\r\nlingered there, studying the approaches of the palace, till eight\r\no\u2019clock, without ever thinking that his absence would revolutionise the\r\nfish market. He perambulated all the surrounding streets, the Rue de\r\nLille, the Rue de l\u2019Universit\u00E9, the Rue de Bourgogne, the Rue Saint\r\nDominique, and even extended his examination to the Esplanade des\r\nInvalides, stopping at certain crossways, and measuring distances as he\r\nwalked along. Then, on coming back to the Quai d\u2019Orsay, he sat down on\r\nthe parapet, and determined that the attack should be made\r\nsimultaneously from all sides. The contingents from the Gros-Caillou\r\ndistrict should arrive by way of the Champ de Mars; the sections from\r\nthe north of Paris should come down by the Madeleine; while those from\r\nthe west and the south would follow the quays, or make their way in\r\nsmall detachments through the then narrow streets of the Faubourg Saint\r\nGermain. However, the other side of the river, the Champs Elysees, with\r\ntheir open avenues, caused him some uneasiness; for he foresaw that\r\ncannon would be stationed there to sweep the quays. He thereupon\r\nmodified several details of his plan, and marked down in a\r\nmemorandum-book the different positions which the several sections\r\nshould occupy during the combat. The chief attack, he concluded, must\r\ncertainly be made from the Rue de Bourgogne and the Rue de\r\nl\u2019Universit\u00E9, while a diversion might be effected on the side of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nWhilst he thus pondered over his plans the eight o\u2019clock sun, warming\r\nthe nape of his neck, shone gaily on the broad footways, and gilded the\r\ncolumns of the great structure in front of him. In imagination he\r\nalready saw the contemplated battle; clusters of men clinging round\r\nthose columns, the gates burst open, the peristyle invaded; and then\r\nscraggy arms suddenly appearing high aloft and planting a banner there.\r\n\r\nAt last he slowly went his way homewards again with his gaze fixed upon\r\nthe ground. But all at once a cooing sound made him look up, and he saw\r\nthat he was passing through the garden of the Tuileries. A number of\r\nwood-pigeons, bridling their necks, were strutting over a lawn near by.\r\nFlorent leant for a moment against the tub of an orange-tree, and\r\nlooked at the grass and the pigeons steeped in sunshine. Right ahead\r\nunder the chestnut-trees all was black. The garden was wrapped in a\r\nwarm silence, broken only by the distant rumbling which came from\r\nbehind the railings of the Rue de Rivoli. The scent of all the greenery\r\naffected Florent, reminding him of Madame Francois. However, a little\r\ngirl ran past, trundling a hoop, and alarmed the pigeons. They flew\r\noff, and settled in a row on the arm of a marble statue of an antique\r\nwrestler standing in the middle of the lawn, and once more, but with\r\nless vivacity, they began to coo and bridle their necks.\r\n\r\nAs Florent was returning to the markets by way of the Rue Vauvilliers,\r\nhe heard Claude Lantier calling to him. The artist was going down into\r\nthe basement of the poultry pavilion. \u201CCome with me!\u201D he cried. \u201CI\u2019m\r\nlooking for that brute Marjolin.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent followed, glad to forget his thoughts and to defer his return\r\nto the fish market for a little longer. Claude told him that his friend\r\nMarjolin now had nothing further to wish for: he had become an utter\r\nanimal. Claude entertained an idea of making him pose on all-fours in\r\nfuture. Whenever he lost his temper over some disappointing sketch he\r\ncame to spend whole hours in the idiot\u2019s company, never speaking, but\r\nstriving to catch his expression when he laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019ll be feeding his pigeons, I dare say,\u201D he said; \u201Cbut unfortunately\r\nI don\u2019t know whereabouts Monsieur Gavard\u2019s storeroom is.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey groped about the cellar. In the middle of it some water was\r\ntrickling from a couple of taps in the dim gloom. The storerooms here\r\nare reserved for pigeons exclusively, and all along the trellising they\r\nheard faint cooings, like the hushed notes of birds nestling under the\r\nleaves when daylight is departing. Claude began to laugh as he heard\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt sounds as though all the lovers in Paris were embracing each other\r\ninside here, doesn\u2019t it?\u201D he exclaimed to his companion.\r\n\r\nHowever, they could not find a single storeroom open, and were\r\nbeginning to think that Marjolin could not be in the cellar, when a\r\nsound of loud, smacking kisses made them suddenly halt before a door\r\nwhich stood slightly ajar. Claude pulled it open and beheld Marjolin,\r\nwhom Cadine was kissing, whilst he, a mere dummy, offered his face\r\nwithout feeling the slightest thrill at the touch of her lips.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, so this is your little game, is it?\u201D said Claude with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201COh,\u201D replied Cadine, quite unabashed, \u201Che likes being kissed, because\r\nhe feels afraid now in the dim light. You do feel frightened, don\u2019t\r\nyou?\u201D\r\n\r\nLike the idiot he was, Marjolin stroked his face with his hands as\r\nthough trying to find the kisses which the girl had just printed there.\r\nAnd he was beginning to stammer out that he was afraid, when Cadine\r\ncontinued: \u201CAnd, besides, I came to help him; I\u2019ve been feeding the\r\npigeons.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent looked at the poor creatures. All along the shelves were rows\r\nof lidless boxes, in which pigeons, showing their motley plumage,\r\ncrowded closely on their stiffened legs. Every now and then a tremor\r\nran along the moving mass; and then the birds settled down again, and\r\nnothing was heard but their confused, subdued notes. Cadine had a\r\nsaucepan near her; she filled her mouth with the water and tares which\r\nit contained, and then, taking up the pigeons one by one, shot the food\r\ndown their throats with amazing rapidity. The poor creatures struggled\r\nand nearly choked, and finally fell down in the boxes with swimming\r\neyes, intoxicated, as it were, by all the food which they were thus\r\nforced to swallow.[*]\r\n\r\n[*] This is the customary mode of fattening pigeons at the Paris\r\nmarkets. The work is usually done by men who make a specialty of it,\r\nand are called _gaveurs_.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CPoor creatures!\u201D exclaimed Claude.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, so much the worse for them,\u201D said Cadine, who had now finished.\r\n\u201CThey are much nicer eating when they\u2019ve been well fed. In a couple of\r\nhours or so all those over yonder will be given a dose of salt water.\r\nThat makes their flesh white and tender. Then two hours afterwards\r\nthey\u2019ll be killed. If you would like to see the killing, there are some\r\nhere which are quite ready. Marjolin will settle their account for them\r\nin a jiffy.\u201D\r\n\r\nMarjolin carried away a box containing some fifty pigeons, and Claude\r\nand Florent followed him. Squatting upon the ground near one of the\r\nwater-taps, he placed the box by his side. Then he laid a framework of\r\nslender wooden bars on the top of a kind of zinc trough, and forthwith\r\nbegan to kill the pigeons. His knife flashed rapidly in his fingers, as\r\nhe seized the birds by the wings, stunned them by a blow on the head\r\nfrom the knife-handle, and then thrust the point of the blade into\r\ntheir throats. They quivered for an instant, and ruffled their feathers\r\nas Marjolin laid them in a row, with their heads between the wooden\r\nbars above the zinc trough, into which their blood fell drop by drop.\r\nHe repeated each different movement with the regularity of clockwork,\r\nthe blows from the knife-handle falling with a monotonous tick-tack as\r\nhe broke the birds\u2019 skulls, and his hand working backwards and forwards\r\nlike a pendulum as he took up the living pigeons on one side and laid\r\nthem down dead on the other. Soon, moreover, he worked with increasing\r\nrapidity, gloating over the massacre with glistening eyes, squatting\r\nthere like a huge delighted bull-dog enjoying the sight of slaughtered\r\nvermin. \u201CTick-tack! Tick-tack!\u201D whilst his tongue clucked as an\r\naccompaniment to the rhythmical movements of his knife. The pigeons\r\nhung down like wisps of silken stuff.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, you enjoy that, don\u2019t you, you great stupid?\u201D exclaimed Cadine.\r\n\u201CHow comical those pigeons look when they bury their heads in their\r\nshoulders to hide their necks! They\u2019re horrid things, you know, and\r\nwould give one nasty bites if they got the chance.\u201D Then she laughed\r\nmore loudly at Marjolin\u2019s increasing, feverish haste; and added: \u201CI\u2019ve\r\nkilled them sometimes myself, but I can\u2019t get on as quickly as he does.\r\nOne day he killed a hundred in ten minutes.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe wooden frame was nearly full; the blood could be heard falling into\r\nthe zinc trough; and as Claude happened to turn round he saw Florent\r\nlooking so pale that he hurriedly led him away. When they got\r\nabove-ground again he made him sit down on a step.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201D he exclaimed, tapping him on the\r\nshoulder. \u201CYou\u2019re fainting away like a woman!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s the smell of the cellar,\u201D murmured Florent, feeling a little\r\nashamed of himself.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, however, that those pigeons, which were forced to\r\nswallow tares and salt water, and then had their skulls broken and\r\ntheir throats slit, had reminded him of the wood-pigeons of the\r\nTuileries gardens, strutting over the green turf, with their satiny\r\nplumage flashing iridescently in the sunlight. He again heard them\r\ncooing on the arm of the marble wrestler amidst the hushed silence of\r\nthe garden, while children trundled their hoops in the deep gloom of\r\nthe chestnuts. And then, on seeing that big fair-haired animal\r\nmassacring his boxful of birds, stunning them with the handle of his\r\nknife and driving its point into their throats, in the depths of that\r\nfoul-smelling cellar, he had felt sick and faint, his legs had almost\r\ngiven way beneath him, while his eyelids quivered tremulously.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, you\u2019d never do for a soldier!\u201D Claude said to him when he\r\nrecovered from his faintness. \u201CThose who sent you to Cayenne must have\r\nbeen very simple-minded folks to fear such a man as you! Why, my good\r\nfellow, if ever you do put yourself at the head of a rising, you won\u2019t\r\ndare to fire a shot. You\u2019ll be too much afraid of killing somebody.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent got up without making any reply. He had become very gloomy, his\r\nface was furrowed by deep wrinkles; and he walked off, leaving Claude\r\nto go back to the cellar alone. As he made his way towards the fish\r\nmarket his thoughts returned to his plan of attack, to the levies of\r\narmed men who were to invade the Palais Bourbon. Cannon would roar from\r\nthe Champs Elysees; the gates would be burst open; blood would stain\r\nthe steps, and men\u2019s brains would bespatter the pillars. A vision of\r\nthe fight passed rapidly before him; and he beheld himself in the midst\r\nof it, deadly pale, and hiding his face in his hands, not daring to\r\nlook around him.\r\n\r\nAs he was crossing the Rue du Pont Neuf he fancied he espied Auguste\u2019s\r\npale face peering round the corner of the fruit pavilion. The assistant\r\nseemed to be watching for someone, and his eyes were starting from his\r\nhead with an expression of intense excitement. Suddenly, however, he\r\nvanished and hastened back to the pork shop.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201D thought Florent. \u201CIs he frightened of me,\r\nI wonder?\u201D\r\n\r\nSome very serious occurrences had taken place that morning at the\r\nQuenu-Gradelles\u2019. Soon after daybreak, Auguste, breathless with\r\nexcitement, had awakened his mistress to tell her that the police had\r\ncome to arrest Monsieur Florent. And he added, with stammering\r\nincoherence, that the latter had gone out, and that he must have done\r\nso with the intention of escaping. Lisa, careless of appearances, at\r\nonce hurried up to her brother-in-law\u2019s room in her dressing-wrapper,\r\nand took possession of La Normande\u2019s photograph, after glancing round\r\nto see if there was anything lying about that might compromise herself\r\nand Quenu. As she was making her way downstairs again, she met the\r\npolice agents on the first floor. The commissary requested her to\r\naccompany them to Florent\u2019s room, where, after speaking to her for a\r\nmoment in a low tone, he installed himself with his men, bidding her\r\nopen the shop as usual so as to avoid giving the alarm to anyone. The\r\ntrap was set.\r\n\r\nLisa\u2019s only worry in the matter was the terrible blow that the arrest\r\nwould prove to poor Quenu. She was much afraid that if he learned that\r\nthe police were in the house, he would spoil everything by his tears;\r\nso she made Auguste swear to observe the most rigid silence on the\r\nsubject. Then she went back to her room, put on her stays, and\r\nconcocted some story for the benefit of Quenu, who was still drowsy.\r\nHalf an hour later she was standing at the door of the shop with all\r\nher usual neatness of appearance, her hair smooth and glossy, and her\r\nface glowing rosily. Auguste was quietly setting out the window. Quenu\r\ncame for a moment on to the footway, yawning slightly, and ridding\r\nhimself of all sleepiness in the fresh morning air. There was nothing\r\nto indicate the drama that was in preparation upstairs.\r\n\r\nThe commissary himself, however, gave the alarm to the neighbourhood by\r\npaying a domiciliary visit to the Mehudins\u2019 abode in the Rue Pirouette.\r\nHe was in possession of the most precise information. In the anonymous\r\nletters which had been sent to the Prefecture, all sorts of statements\r\nwere made respecting Florent\u2019s alleged intrigue with the beautiful\r\nNorman. Perhaps, thought the commissary, he had now taken refuge with\r\nher; and so, accompanied by two of his men, he proceeded to knock at\r\nthe door in the name of the law. The Mehudins had only just got up. The\r\nold woman opened the door in a fury; but suddenly calmed down and began\r\nto smile when she learned the business on hand. She seated herself and\r\nfastened her clothes, while declaring to the officers: \u201CWe are honest\r\nfolks here, and have nothing to be afraid of. You can search wherever\r\nyou like.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, as La Normande delayed to open the door of her room, the\r\ncommissary told his men to break it open. The young woman was scarcely\r\nclad when the others entered, and this unceremonious invasion, which\r\nshe could not understand, fairly exasperated her. She flushed crimson\r\nfrom anger rather than from shame, and seemed as though she were about\r\nto fly at the officers. The commissary, at the sight, stepped forward\r\nto protect his men, repeating in his cold voice: \u201CIn the name of the\r\nlaw! In the name of the law!\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon La Normande threw herself upon a chair, and burst into a wild\r\nfit of hysterical sobbing at finding herself so powerless. She was\r\nquite at a loss to understand what these men wanted with her. The\r\ncommissary, however, had noticed how scantily she was clad, and taking\r\na shawl from a peg, he flung it over her. Still she did not wrap it\r\nround her, but only sobbed the more bitterly as she watched the men\r\nroughly searching the apartment.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut what have I done?\u201D she at last stammered out. \u201CWhat are you\r\nlooking for here?\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon the commissary pronounced the name of Florent; and La\r\nNormande, catching sight of the old woman, who was standing at the\r\ndoor, cried out: \u201COh, the wretch! This is her doing!\u201D and she rushed at\r\nher mother.\r\n\r\nShe would have struck her if she had reached her; but the police agents\r\nheld her back, and forcibly wrapped her in the shawl. Meanwhile, she\r\nstruggled violently, and exclaimed in a choking voice:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you take me for? That Florent has never been in this room, I\r\ntell you. There was nothing at all between us. People are always trying\r\nto injure me in the neighbourhood; but just let anyone come here and\r\nsay anything before my face, and then you\u2019ll see! You\u2019ll lock me up\r\nafterwards, I dare say, but I don\u2019t mind that! Florent, indeed! What a\r\nlie! What nonsense!\u201D\r\n\r\nThis flood of words seemed to calm her; and her anger now turned\r\nagainst Florent, who was the cause of all the trouble. Addressing the\r\ncommissary, she sought to justify herself.\r\n\r\n\u201CI did not know his real character, sir,\u201D she said. \u201CHe had such a mild\r\nmanner that he deceived us all. I was unwilling to believe all I heard,\r\nbecause I know people are so malicious. He only came here to give\r\nlessons to my little boy, and went away directly they were over. I gave\r\nhim a meal here now and again, that\u2019s true and sometimes made him a\r\npresent of a fine fish. That\u2019s all. But this will be a warning to me,\r\nand you won\u2019t catch me showing the same kindness to anyone again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut hasn\u2019t he given you any of his papers to take care of?\u201D asked the\r\ncommissary.\r\n\r\n\u201COh no, indeed! I swear it. I\u2019d give them up to you at once if he had.\r\nI\u2019ve had quite enough of this, I can tell you! It\u2019s no joke to see you\r\ntossing all my things about and ferreting everywhere in this way. Oh!\r\nyou may look; there\u2019s nothing.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe officers, who examined every article of furniture, now wished to\r\nenter the little closet where Muche slept. The child had been awakened\r\nby the noise, and for the last few moments he had been crying bitterly,\r\nas though he imagined that he was going to be murdered.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is my boy\u2019s room,\u201D said La Normande, opening the door.\r\n\r\nMuche, quite naked, ran up and threw his arms round his mother\u2019s neck.\r\nShe pacified him, and laid him down in her own bed. The officers came\r\nout of the little room again almost immediately, and the commissary had\r\njust made up his mind to retire, when the child, still in tears,\r\nwhispered in his mother\u2019s ear: \u201CThey\u2019ll take my copy-books. Don\u2019t let\r\nthem have my copy-books.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes; that\u2019s true,\u201D cried La Normande; \u201Cthere are some copy-books.\r\nWait a moment, gentlemen, and I\u2019ll give them to you. I want you to see\r\nthat I\u2019m not hiding anything from you. Then, you\u2019ll find some of his\r\nwriting inside these. You\u2019re quite at liberty to hang him as far as I\u2019m\r\nconcerned; you won\u2019t find me trying to cut him down.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon she handed Muche\u2019s books and the copies set by Florent to the\r\ncommissary. But at this the boy sprang angrily out of bed, and began to\r\nscratch and bite his mother, who put him back again with a box on the\r\nears. Then he began to bellow.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the uproar, Mademoiselle Saget appeared on the\r\nthreshold, craning her neck forward. Finding all the doors open, she\r\nhad come in to offer her services to old Madame Mehudin. She spied\r\nabout and listened, and expressed extreme pity for these poor women,\r\nwho had no one to defend them. The commissary, however, had begun to\r\nread the copies with a grave air. The frequent repetition of such words\r\nas \u201Ctyrannically,\u201D \u201Cliberticide,\u201D \u201Cunconstitutional,\u201D and\r\n\u201Crevolutionary\u201D made him frown; and on reading the sentence, \u201CWhen the\r\nhour strikes, the guilty shall fall,\u201D he tapped his fingers on the\r\npaper and said: \u201CThis is very serious, very serious indeed.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon he gave the books to one of his men, and went off. Claire,\r\nwho had hitherto not shown herself, now opened her door, and watched\r\nthe police officers go down the stairs. And afterwards she came into\r\nher sister\u2019s bedroom, which she had not entered for a year.\r\nMademoiselle Saget appeared to be on the best of terms with La\r\nNormande, and was hanging over her in a caressing way, bringing the\r\nshawl forward to cover her the better, and listening to her angry\r\nindignation with an expression of the deepest sympathy.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou wretched coward!\u201D exclaimed Claire, planting herself in front of\r\nher sister.\r\n\r\nLa Normande sprang up, quivering with anger, and let the shawl fall to\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, you\u2019ve been playing the spy, have you?\u201D she screamed. \u201CDare to\r\nrepeat what you\u2019ve just said!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou wretched coward!\u201D repeated Claire, in still more insulting tones\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nThereupon La Normande struck Claire with all her force; and in return\r\nClaire, turning terribly pale, sprang upon her sister and dug her nails\r\ninto her neck. They struggled together for a moment or two, tearing at\r\neach other\u2019s hair and trying to choke one another. Claire, fragile\r\nthough she was, pushed La Normande backward with such tremendous\r\nviolence that they both fell against the wardrobe, smashing the mirror\r\non its front. Muche was roaring, and old Madame Mehudin called to\r\nMademoiselle Saget to come and help her separate the sisters. Claire,\r\nhowever, shook herself free.\r\n\r\n\u201CCoward! Coward!\u201D she cried; \u201CI\u2019ll go and tell the poor fellow that it\r\nis you who have betrayed him.\u201D\r\n\r\nHer mother, however, blocked the doorway, and would not let her pass,\r\nwhile La Normande seized her from behind, and then, Mademoiselle Saget\r\ncoming to the assistance of the other two, the three of them dragged\r\nClaire into her bedroom and locked the door upon her, in spite of all\r\nher frantic resistance. In her rage she tried to kick the door down,\r\nand smashed everything in the room. Soon afterwards, however, nothing\r\ncould be heard except a furious scratching, the sound of metal scarping\r\nat the plaster. The girl was trying to loosen the door hinges with the\r\npoints of her scissors.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe would have murdered me if she had had a knife,\u201D said La Normande,\r\nlooking about for her clothes, in order to dress herself. \u201CShe\u2019ll be\r\ndoing something dreadful, you\u2019ll see, one of these days, with that\r\njealousy of hers! We mustn\u2019t let her get out on any account: she\u2019d\r\nbring the whole neighbourhood down upon us!\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget went off in all haste. She reached the corner of the\r\nRue Pirouette just as the commissary of police was re-entering the side\r\npassage of the Quenu-Gradelles\u2019 house. She grasped the situation at\r\nonce, and entered the shop with such glistening eyes that Lisa enjoined\r\nsilence by a gesture which called her attention to the presence of\r\nQuenu, who was hanging up some pieces of salt pork. As soon as he had\r\nreturned to the kitchen, the old maid in a low voice described the\r\nscenes that had just taken place at the Mehudins\u2019. Lisa, as she bent\r\nover the counter, with her hand resting on a dish of larded veal,\r\nlistened to her with the happy face of one who triumphs. Then, as a\r\ncustomer entered the shop, and asked for a couple of pig\u2019s trotters,\r\nLisa wrapped them up, and handed them over with a thoughtful air.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor my own part, I bear La Normande no ill-will,\u201D she said to\r\nMademoiselle Saget, when they were alone again. \u201CI used to be very fond\r\nof her, and have always been sorry that other people made mischief\r\nbetween us. The proof that I\u2019ve no animosity against her is here in\r\nthis photograph, which I saved from falling into the hands of the\r\npolice, and which I\u2019m quite ready to give her back if she will come and\r\nask me for it herself.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe took the photograph out of her pocket as she spoke. Mademoiselle\r\nSaget scrutinised it and sniggered as she read the inscription,\r\n\u201CLouise, to her dear friend Florent.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll be acting wisely,\u201D she said in her cutting voice.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019d do better to keep it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no,\u201D replied Lisa; \u201CI\u2019m anxious for all this silly nonsense to\r\ncome to an end. To-day is the day of reconciliation. We\u2019ve had enough\r\nunpleasantness, and the neighbourhood\u2019s now going to be quiet and\r\npeaceful again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, well, shall I go and tell La Normande that you are expecting\r\nher?\u201D asked the old maid.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; I shall be very glad if you will.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget then made her way back to the Rue Pirouette, and\r\ngreatly frightened the fish-girl by telling her that she had just seen\r\nher photograph in Lisa\u2019s pocket. She could not, however, at once\r\nprevail upon her to comply with her rival\u2019s terms. La Normande\r\npropounded conditions of her own. She would go, but Madame Quenu must\r\ncome to the door of the shop to receive her. Thus the old maid was\r\nobliged to make another couple of journeys between the two rivals\r\nbefore their meeting could be satisfactorily arranged. At last,\r\nhowever, to her great delight, she succeeded in negotiating the peace\r\nwhich was destined to cause so much talk and excitement. As she passed\r\nClaire\u2019s door for the last time she still heard the sound of the\r\nscissors scraping away at the plaster.\r\n\r\nWhen she had at last carried a definite reply to Madame Quenu,\r\nMademoiselle Saget hurried off to find Madame Lec\u0153ur and La Sarriette;\r\nand all three of them took up their position on the footway at the\r\ncorner of the fish market, just in front of the pork shop. Here they\r\nwould be certain to have a good view of every detail of the meeting.\r\nThey felt extremely impatient, and while pretending to chat together\r\nkept an anxious look-out in the direction of the Rue Pirouette, along\r\nwhich La Normande must come. The news of the reconciliation was already\r\ntravelling through the markets, and while some saleswomen stood up\r\nbehind their stalls trying to get a view of what was taking place,\r\nothers, still more inquisitive, actually left their places and took up\r\na position in the covered way. Every eye in the markets was directed\r\nupon the pork shop; the whole neighbourhood was on the tip-toe of\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nIt was a very solemn affair. When La Normande at last turned the corner\r\nof the Rue Pirouette the excitement was so great that the women held\r\ntheir breath.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe has got her diamonds on,\u201D murmured La Sarriette.\r\n\r\n\u201CJust look how she stalks along,\u201D added Madame Lec\u0153ur; \u201Cthe stuck-up\r\ncreature!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Norman was, indeed, advancing with the mien of a queen\r\nwho condescends to make peace. She had made a most careful toilet,\r\nfrizzing her hair and turning up a corner of her apron to display her\r\ncashmere skirt. She had even put on a new and rich lace bow. Conscious\r\nthat the whole market was staring at her, she assumed a still haughtier\r\nair as she approached the pork shop. When she reached the door she\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow it\u2019s beautiful Lisa\u2019s turn,\u201D remarked Mademoiselle Saget. \u201CMind\r\nyou pay attention.\u201D\r\n\r\nBeautiful Lisa smilingly quitted her counter. She crossed the\r\nshop-floor at a leisurely pace, and came and offered her hand to the\r\nbeautiful Norman. She also was smartly dressed, with her dazzling linen\r\nand scrupulous neatness. A murmur ran through the crowd of fish-wives,\r\nall their heads gathered close together, and animated chatter ensued.\r\nThe two women had gone inside the shop, and the _crepines_ in the\r\nwindow prevented them from being clearly seen. However, they seemed to\r\nbe conversing affectionately, addressing pretty compliments to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\u201CSee!\u201D suddenly exclaimed Mademoiselle Saget, \u201Cthe beautiful Norman\u2019s\r\nbuying something! What is it she\u2019s buying? It\u2019s a chitterling, I\r\nbelieve! Ah! Look! look! You didn\u2019t see it, did you? Well, beautiful\r\nLisa just gave her the photograph; she slipped it into her hand with\r\nthe chitterling.\u201D\r\n\r\nFresh salutations were then seen to pass between the two women; and the\r\nbeautiful Lisa, exceeding even the courtesies which had been agreed\r\nupon, accompanied the beautiful Norman to the footway. There they stood\r\nlaughing together, exhibiting themselves to the neighbourhood like a\r\ncouple of good friends. The markets were quite delighted; and the\r\nsaleswomen returned to their stalls, declaring that everything had\r\npassed off extremely well.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget, however, detained Madame Lec\u0153ur and La Sarriette.\r\nThe drama was not over yet. All three kept their eyes fixed on the\r\nhouse opposite with such keen curiosity that they seemed trying to\r\npenetrate the very walls. To pass the time away they once more began to\r\ntalk of the beautiful Norman.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s without a lover now,\u201D remarked Madame Lec\u0153ur.\r\n\r\n\u201COh! she\u2019s got Monsieur Lebigre,\u201D replied La Sarriette, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut surely Monsieur Lebigre won\u2019t have anything more to say to her.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget shrugged her shoulders. \u201CAh, you don\u2019t know him,\u201D\r\nshe said. \u201CHe won\u2019t care a straw about all this business. He knows what\r\nhe\u2019s about, and La Normande is rich. They\u2019ll come together in a couple\r\nof months, you\u2019ll see. Old Madame Mehudin\u2019s been scheming to bring\r\nabout their marriage for a long time past.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, anyway,\u201D retorted the butter dealer, \u201Cthe commissary found\r\nFlorent at her lodgings.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, indeed; I\u2019m sure I never told you that. The long\r\nspindle-shanks had gone way,\u201D replied the old maid. She paused to take\r\na breath; then resumed in an indignant tone, \u201CWhat distressed me most\r\nwas to hear of all the abominable things that the villain had taught\r\nlittle Muche. You\u2019d really never believe it. There was a whole bundle\r\nof papers.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat sort of abominable things?\u201D asked La Sarriette with interest.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, all kinds of filth. The commissary said there was quite sufficient\r\nthere to hang him. The fellow\u2019s a perfect monster! To go and demoralise\r\na child! Why, it\u2019s almost past believing! Little Muche is certainly a\r\nscamp, but that\u2019s no reason why he should be given over to the \u2018Reds,\u2019\r\nis it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly not,\u201D assented the two others.\r\n\r\n\u201CHowever, all these mysterious goings-on will come to an end now. You\r\nremember my telling you once that there was some strange goings-on at\r\nthe Quenus\u2019? Well, you see, I was right in my conclusions, wasn\u2019t I?\r\nThank God, however, the neighbourhood will now be able to breathe\r\neasily. It was high time strong steps were taken, for things had got to\r\nsuch a pitch that one actually felt afraid of being murdered in broad\r\ndaylight. There was no pleasure in life. All the dreadful stories and\r\nreports one heard were enough to worry one to death. And it was all\r\nowing to that man, that dreadful Florent. Now beautiful Lisa and the\r\nbeautiful Norman have sensibly made friends again. It was their duty to\r\ndo so for the sake of the peace and quietness of us all. Everything\r\nwill go on satisfactorily now, you\u2019ll find. Ah! there\u2019s poor Monsieur\r\nQuenu laughing yonder!\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu had again come on to the footway, and was joking with Madame\r\nTaboureau\u2019s little servant. He seemed quite gay and skittish that\r\nmorning. He took hold of the little servant\u2019s hands, and squeezed her\r\nfingers so tightly, in the exuberance of his spirits, that he made her\r\ncry out. Lisa had the greatest trouble to get him to go back into the\r\nkitchen. She was impatiently pacing about the shop, fearing lest\r\nFlorent should make his appearance; and she called to her husband to\r\ncome away, dreading a meeting between him and his brother.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s getting quite vexed,\u201D said Mademoiselle Saget. \u201CPoor Monsieur\r\nQuenu, you see, knows nothing at all about what\u2019s taking place. Just\r\nlook at him there, laughing like a child! Madame Taboureau, you know,\r\nsaid that she should have nothing more to do with the Quenus if they\r\npersisted in bringing themselves into discredit by keeping that Florent\r\nwith them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, now, I suppose, they will stick to the fortune,\u201D remarked Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, no, indeed, my dear. The other one has had his share already.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CReally? How do you know that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, it\u2019s clear enough, that is!\u201D replied the old maid after a\r\nmomentary hesitation, but without giving any proof of her assertions.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s had even more than his share. The Quenus will be several thousand\r\nfrancs out of pocket. Money flies, you know, when a man has such vices\r\nas he has. I dare say you don\u2019t know that there was another woman mixed\r\nup in it all. Yes, indeed, old Madame Verlaque, the wife of the former\r\ninspector; you know the sallow-faced thing well enough.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe others protested that it surely wasn\u2019t possible. Why, Madame\r\nVerlaque was positively hideous!\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat! do you think me a liar?\u201D cried Mademoiselle Saget, with angry\r\nindignation. \u201CWhy, her letters to him have been found, a whole pile of\r\nletters, in which she asks for money, ten and twenty francs at a time.\r\nThere\u2019s no doubt at all about it. I\u2019m quite certain in my own mind that\r\nthey killed the husband between them.\u201D\r\n\r\nLa Sarriette and Madame Lec\u0153ur were convinced; but they were beginning\r\nto get very impatient. They had been waiting on the footway for more\r\nthan an hour, and feared that somebody might be robbing their stalls\r\nduring their long absence. So Mademoiselle Saget began to give them\r\nsome further interesting information to keep them from going off.\r\nFlorent could not have taken to flight, said she; he was certain to\r\nreturn, and it would be very interesting to see him arrested. Then she\r\nwent on to describe the trap that had been laid for him, while Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur and La Sarriette continued scrutinising the house from top to\r\nbottom, keeping watch upon every opening, and at each moment expecting\r\nto see the hats of the detectives appear at one of the doors or\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho would ever imagine, now, that the place was full of police?\u201D\r\nobserved the butter dealer.\r\n\r\n\u201COh! they\u2019re in the garret at the top,\u201D said the old maid. \u201CThey\u2019ve\r\nleft the window open, you see, just as they found it. Look! I think I\r\ncan see one of them hiding behind the pomegranate on the balcony.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe others excitedly craned out their necks, but could see nothing.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, no, it\u2019s only a shadow,\u201D continued Mademoiselle Saget. \u201CThe little\r\ncurtains even are perfectly still. The detectives must be sitting down\r\nin the room, and keeping quiet.\u201D\r\n\r\nJust at that moment the women caught sight of Gavard coming out of the\r\nfish market with a thoughtful air. They looked at him with glistening\r\neyes, without speaking. They had drawn close to one another, and stood\r\nthere rigid in their drooping skirts. The poultry dealer came up to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you seen Florent go by?\u201D he asked.\r\n\r\nThey replied that they had not.\r\n\r\n\u201CI want to speak to him at once,\u201D continued Gavard. \u201CHe isn\u2019t in the\r\nfish market. He must have gone up to his room. But you would have seen\r\nhim, though, if he had.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe women had turned rather pale. They still kept looking at each other\r\nwith a knowing expression, their lips twitching slightly every now and\r\nthen. \u201CWe have only been here some five minutes, said Madame Lec\u0153ur\r\nunblushingly, as her brother-in-law still stood hesitating.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, then, I\u2019ll go upstairs and see. I\u2019ll risk the five flights,\u201D\r\nrejoined Gavard with a laugh.\r\n\r\nLa Sarriette stepped forward as though she wished to detain him, but\r\nher aunt took hold of her arm and drew her back.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet him alone, you big simpleton!\u201D she whispered. \u201CIt\u2019s the best thing\r\nthat can happen to him. It\u2019ll teach him to treat us with respect in\r\nfuture.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe won\u2019t say again that I ate tainted meat,\u201D muttered Mademoiselle\r\nSaget in a low tone.\r\n\r\nThey said nothing more. La Sarriette was very red; but the two others\r\nstill remained quite yellow. But they now averted their heads, feeling\r\nconfused by each other\u2019s looks, and at a loss what to do with their\r\nhands, which they buried beneath their aprons. Presently their eyes\r\ninstinctively came back to the house, penetrating the walls, as it\r\nwere, following Gavard in his progress up the stairs. When they\r\nimagined that he had entered Florent\u2019s room they again exchanged\r\nfurtive glances. La Sarriette laughed nervously. All at once they\r\nfancied they could see the window curtains moving, and this led them to\r\nbelieve that a struggle was taking place. But the house-front remained\r\nas tranquil as ever in the sunshine; and another quarter of an hour of\r\nunbroken quietness passed away, during which the three women\u2019s nervous\r\nexcitement became more and more intense. They were beginning to feel\r\nquite faint when a man hurriedly came out of the passage and ran off to\r\nget a cab. Five minutes later Gavard appeared, followed by two police\r\nofficers. Lisa, who had stepped out on to the footway on observing the\r\ncab, hastily hurried back into the shop.\r\n\r\nGavard was very pale. The police had searched him upstairs, and had\r\ndiscovered the revolver and cartridge case in his possession. Judging\r\nby the commissary\u2019s stern expression on hearing his name, the poultry\r\ndealer deemed himself lost. This was a terrible ending to his plotting\r\nthat had never entered into his calculations. The Tuileries would never\r\nforgive him! His legs gave way beneath him as though the firing party\r\nwas already awaiting him outside. When he got into the street, however,\r\nhis vanity lent him sufficient strength to walk erect; and he even\r\nmanaged to force a smile, as he knew the market people were looking at\r\nhim. They should see him die bravely, he resolved.\r\n\r\nHowever, La Sarriette and Madame Lec\u0153ur rushed up to him and anxiously\r\ninquired what was the matter; and the butter dealer began to cry, while\r\nLa Sarriette embraced her uncle, manifesting the deepest emotion. As\r\nGavard held her clasped in his arms, he slipped a key into her hand,\r\nand whispered in her ear: \u201CTake everything, and burn the papers.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he got into the cab with the same mien as he would have ascended\r\nthe scaffold. As the vehicle disappeared round the corner of the Rue\r\nPierre Lescot, Madame Lec\u0153ur observed La Sarriette trying to hide the\r\nkey in her pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s of no use you trying that little game on me, my dear,\u201D she\r\nexclaimed, clenching her teeth; \u201CI saw him slip it into your hand. As\r\ntrue as there\u2019s a God in Heaven, I\u2019ll go to the gaol and tell him\r\neverything, if you don\u2019t treat me properly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf course I shall treat you properly, aunt, dear,\u201D replied La\r\nSarriette, with an embarrassed smile.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well, then, let us go to his rooms at once. It\u2019s of no use to\r\ngive the police time to poke their dirty hands in the cupboards.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget, who had been listening with gleaming eyes, followed\r\nthem, running along in the rear as quickly as her short legs could\r\ncarry her. She had no thought, now, of waiting for Florent. From the\r\nRue Rambuteau to the Rue de la Cossonnerie she manifested the most\r\nhumble obsequiousness, and volunteered to explain matters to Madame\r\nLeonce, the doorkeeper.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see,\u201D the butter dealer curtly replied.\r\n\r\nHowever, on reaching the house a preliminary parley\u2014as Mademoiselle\r\nSaget had opined\u2014proved to be necessary. Madame Leonce refused to allow\r\nthe women to go up to her tenant\u2019s room. She put on an expression of\r\nsevere austerity, and seemed greatly shocked by the sight of La\r\nSarriette\u2019s loosely fastened fichu. However, after the old maid had\r\nwhispered a few words to her and she was shown the key, she gave way.\r\nWhen they got upstairs she surrendered the rooms and furniture to the\r\nothers article by article, apparently as heartbroken as if she had been\r\ncompelled to show a party of burglars the place where her own money was\r\nsecreted.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere, take everything and have done with it!\u201D she cried at last,\r\nthrowing herself into an arm-chair.\r\n\r\nLa Sarriette was already eagerly trying the key in the locks of\r\ndifferent closets. Madame Lec\u0153ur, all suspicion, pressed her so closely\r\nthat she exclaimed: \u201CReally, aunt, you get in my way. Do leave my arms\r\nfree, at any rate.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt last they succeeded in opening a wardrobe opposite the window,\r\nbetween the fireplace and the bed. And then all four women broke into\r\nexclamations. On the middle shelf lay some ten thousand francs in gold,\r\nmethodically arranged in little piles. Gavard, who had prudently\r\ndeposited the bulk of his fortune in the hands of a notary, had kept\r\nthis sum by him for the purposes of the coming outbreak. He had been\r\nwont to say with great solemnity that his contribution to the\r\nrevolution was quite ready. The fact was that he had sold out certain\r\nstock, and every night took an intense delight in contemplating those\r\nten thousand francs, gloating over them, and finding something quite\r\nroysterous and insurrectional in their appearance. Sometimes when he\r\nwas in bed he dreamed that a fight was going on in the wardrobe; he\r\ncould hear guns being fired there, paving-stones being torn up and\r\npiled into barricades, and voices shouting in clamorous triumph; and he\r\nsaid to himself that it was his money fighting against the Government.\r\n\r\nLa Sarriette, however, had stretched out her hands with a cry of\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\u201CPaws off, little one!\u201D exclaimed Madame Lec\u0153ur in a hoarse voice.\r\n\r\nAs she stood there in the reflection of the gold, she looked yellower\r\nthan ever\u2014her face discoloured by biliousness, her eyes glowing\r\nfeverishly from the liver complaint which was secretly undermining her.\r\nBehind her Mademoiselle Saget on tip-toe was gazing ecstatically into\r\nthe wardrobe, and Madame Leonce had now risen from her seat, and was\r\ngrowling sulkily.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy uncle said I was to take everything,\u201D declared the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd am I to have nothing, then; I who have done so much for him?\u201D\r\ncried the doorkeeper.\r\n\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur was almost choking with excitement. She pushed the others\r\naway, and clung hold of the wardrobe, screaming: \u201CIt all belongs to me!\r\nI am his nearest relative. You are a pack of thieves, you are! I\u2019d\r\nrather throw it all out of the window than see you have it!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen silence fell, and they all four stood glowering at each other. The\r\nkerchief that La Sarriette wore over her breast was now altogether\r\nunfastened, and she displayed her bosom heaving with warm life, her\r\nmoist red lips, her rosy nostrils. Madame Lec\u0153ur grew still more sour\r\nas she saw how lovely the girl looked in the excitement of her longing\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D she said in a lower tone, \u201Cwe won\u2019t fight about it. You are his\r\nniece, and I\u2019ll divide the money with you. We will each take a pile in\r\nturn.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon they pushed the other two aside. The butter dealer took the\r\nfirst pile, which at once disappeared within her skirts. Then La\r\nSarriette took a pile. They kept a close watch upon one another, ready\r\nto fight at the slightest attempt at cheating. Their fingers were\r\nthrust forward in turn, the hideous knotted fingers of the aunt and the\r\nwhite fingers of the niece, soft and supple as silk. Slowly they filled\r\ntheir pockets. When there was only one pile left, La Sarriette objected\r\nto her aunt taking it, as she had commenced; and she suddenly divided\r\nit between Mademoiselle Saget and Madame Leonce, who had watched them\r\npocket the gold with feverish impatience.\r\n\r\n\u201CMuch obliged to you!\u201D snarled the doorkeeper. \u201CFifty francs for having\r\ncoddled him up with tisane and broth! The old deceiver told me he had\r\nno relatives!\u201D\r\n\r\nBefore locking the wardrobe up again, Madame Lec\u0153ur searched it\r\nthoroughly from top to bottom. It contained all the political works\r\nwhich were forbidden admission into the country, the pamphlets printed\r\nat Brussels, the scandalous histories of the Bonapartes, and the\r\nforeign caricatures ridiculing the Emperor. One of Gavard\u2019s greatest\r\ndelights was to shut himself up with a friend, and show him all these\r\ncompromising things.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe told me that I was to burn all the papers,\u201D said La Sarriette.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, nonsense! we\u2019ve no fire, and it would take up too long. The police\r\nwill soon be here! We must get out of this!\u201D\r\n\r\nThey all four hastened off; but they had not reached the bottom of the\r\nstairs before the police met them, and made Madame Leonce return with\r\nthem upstairs. The three others, making themselves as small as\r\npossible, hurriedly escaped into the street. They walked away in single\r\nfile at a brisk pace; the aunt and niece considerably incommoded by the\r\nweight of their drooping pockets. Mademoiselle Saget had kept her fifty\r\nfrancs in her closed fist, and remained deep in thought, brooding over\r\na plan for extracting something more from the heavy pockets in front of\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D she exclaimed, as they reached the corner of the fish market,\r\n\u201Cwe\u2019ve got here at a lucky moment. There\u2019s Florent yonder, just going\r\nto walk into the trap.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent, indeed, was just then returning to the markets after his\r\nprolonged perambulation. He went into his office to change his coat,\r\nand then set about his daily duties, seeing that the marble slabs were\r\nproperly washed, and slowly strolling along the alleys. He fancied that\r\nthe fish-wives looked at him in a somewhat strange manner; they\r\nchuckled too, and smiled significantly as he passed them. Some new\r\nvexation, he thought, was in store for him. For some time past those\r\nhuge, terrible women had not allowed him a day\u2019s peace. However, as he\r\npassed the Mehudins\u2019 stall he was very much surprised to hear the old\r\nwoman address him in a honeyed tone: \u201CThere\u2019s just been a gentleman\r\ninquiring for you, Monsieur Florent; a middle-aged gentleman. He\u2019s gone\r\nto wait for you in your room.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs the old fish-wife, who was squatting, all of a heap, on her chair,\r\nspoke these words, she felt such a delicious thrill of satisfied\r\nvengeance that her huge body fairly quivered. Florent, still doubtful,\r\nglanced at the beautiful Norman; but the young woman, now completely\r\nreconciled with her mother, turned on her tap and slapped her fish,\r\npretending not to hear what was being said.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are quite sure?\u201D said Florent to Mother Mehudin.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes, indeed. Isn\u2019t that so, Louise?\u201D said the old woman in a\r\nshriller voice.\r\n\r\nFlorent concluded that it must be some one who wanted to see him about\r\nthe great business, and he resolved to go up to his room. He was just\r\nabout to leave the pavilion, when, happening to turn round, he observed\r\nthe beautiful Norman watching him with a grave expression on her face.\r\nThen he passed in front of the three gossips.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you notice that there\u2019s no one in the pork shop?\u201D remarked\r\nMademoiselle Saget. \u201CBeautiful Lisa\u2019s not the woman to compromise\r\nherself.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe shop was, indeed, quite empty. The front of the house was still\r\nbright with sunshine; the building looked like some honest, prosperous\r\npile guilelessly warming itself in the morning rays. Up above, the\r\npomegranate on the balcony was in full bloom. As Florent crossed the\r\nroadway he gave a friendly nod to Logre and Monsieur Lebigre, who\r\nappeared to be enjoying the fresh air on the doorstep of the latter\u2019s\r\nestablishment. They returned his greeting with a smile. Florent was\r\nthen about to enter the side-passage, when he fancied he saw Auguste\u2019s\r\npale face hastily vanishing from its dark and narrow depths. Thereupon\r\nhe turned back and glanced into the shop to make sure that the\r\nmiddle-aged gentleman was not waiting for him there. But he saw no one\r\nbut Mouton, who sat on a block displaying his double chin and bristling\r\nwhiskers, and gazed at him defiantly with his great yellow eyes. And\r\nwhen he had at last made up his mind to enter the passage, Lisa\u2019s face\r\nappeared behind the little curtain of a glazed door at the back of the\r\nshop.\r\n\r\nA hush had fallen over the fish market. All the huge paunches and\r\nbosoms held their breath, waiting till Florent should disappear from\r\nsight. Then there was an uproarious outbreak; and the bosoms heaved\r\nwildly and the paunches nearly burst with malicious delight. The joke\r\nhad succeeded. Nothing could be more comical. As old Mother Mehudin\r\nvented her merriment she shook and quivered like a wine-skin that is\r\nbeing emptied. Her story of the middle-aged gentleman went the round of\r\nthe market, and the fish-wives found it extremely amusing. At last the\r\nlong spindle-shanks was collared, and they would no longer always have\r\nhis miserable face and gaol-bird\u2019s expression before their eyes. They\r\nall wished him a pleasant journey, and trusted that they might get a\r\nhandsome fellow for their next inspector. And in their delight they\r\nrushed about from one stall to another, and felt inclined to dance\r\nround their marble slabs like a lot of holiday-making schoolgirls. The\r\nbeautiful Norman, however, watched this outbreak of joy in a rigid\r\nattitude, not daring to move for fear she should burst into tears; and\r\nshe kept her hands pressed upon a big skate to cool her feverish\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou see how those Mehudins turn their backs upon him now that he\u2019s\r\ncome to grief,\u201D said Madame Lec\u0153ur.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, and they\u2019re quite right too,\u201D replied Mademoiselle Saget.\r\n\u201CBesides, matters are settled now, my dear, and we\u2019re to have no more\r\ndisputes. You\u2019ve every reason to be satisfied; leave the others to act\r\nas they please.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s only the old woman who is laughing,\u201D La Sarriette remarked; \u201CLa\r\nNormande looks anything but happy.\u201D\r\n\r\nMeantime, upstairs in his bedroom, Florent allowed himself to be taken\r\nas unresistingly as a sheep. The police officers sprang roughly upon\r\nhim, expecting, no doubt, that they would meet with a desperate\r\nresistance. He quietly begged them to leave go of him; and then sat\r\ndown on a chair while they packed up his papers, and the red scarves,\r\narmlets, and banners. He did not seem at all surprised at this ending;\r\nindeed, it was something of a relief to him, though he would not\r\nfrankly confess it. But he suffered acutely at thought of the bitter\r\nhatred which had sent him into that room; he recalled Auguste\u2019s pale\r\nface and the sniggering looks of the fish-wives; he bethought himself\r\nof old Madame Mehudin\u2019s words, La Normande\u2019s silence, and the empty\r\nshop downstairs. The markets were leagued against him, he reflected;\r\nthe whole neighbourhood had conspired to hand him over to the police.\r\nThe mud of those greasy streets had risen up all around to overwhelm\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nAnd amidst all the round faces which flitted before his mind\u2019s eye\r\nthere suddenly appeared that of Quenu, and a spasm of mortal agony\r\ncontracted his heart.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, get along downstairs!\u201D exclaimed one of the officers, roughly.\r\n\r\nFlorent rose and proceeded to go downstairs. When he reached the second\r\nfloor he asked to be allowed to return; he had forgotten something, he\r\nsaid. But the officers refused to let him go back, and began to hustle\r\nhim forward. Then he besought them to let him return to his room again,\r\nand even offered them the money he had in his pocket. Two of them at\r\nlast consented to return with him, threatening to blow his brains out\r\nshould he attempt to play them any trick; and they drew their revolvers\r\nout of their pockets as they spoke. However, on reaching his room once\r\nmore Florent simply went straight to the chaffinch\u2019s cage, took the\r\nbird out of it, kissed it between its wings, and set it at liberty. He\r\nwatched it fly away through the open window, into the sunshine, and\r\nalight, as though giddy, on the roof of the fish market. Then it flew\r\noff again and disappeared over the markets in the direction of the\r\nSquare des Innocents. For a moment longer Florent remained face to face\r\nwith the sky, the free and open sky; and he thought of the wood-pigeons\r\ncooing in the garden of the Tuileries, and of those other pigeons down\r\nin the market cellars with their throats slit by Marjolin\u2019s knife. Then\r\nhe felt quite broken, and turned and followed the officers, who were\r\nputting their revolvers back into their pockets as they shrugged their\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the bottom of the stairs, Florent stopped before the door\r\nwhich led into the kitchen. The commissary, who was waiting for him\r\nthere, seemed almost touched by his gentle submissiveness, and asked\r\nhim: \u201CWould you like to say good-bye to your brother?\u201D\r\n\r\nFor a moment Florent hesitated. He looked at the door. A tremendous\r\nnoise of cleavers and pans came from the kitchen. Lisa, with the design\r\nof keeping her husband occupied, had persuaded him to make the\r\nblack-puddings in the morning instead of in the evening, as was his\r\nwont. The onions were simmering on the fire, and over all the noisy\r\nuproar Florent could hear Quenu\u2019s joyous voice exclaiming, \u201CAh, dash it\r\nall, the pudding will be excellent, that it will! Auguste, hand me the\r\nfat!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent thanked the commissary, but refused his offer. He was afraid to\r\nreturn any more into that warm kitchen, reeking with the odour of\r\nboiling onions, and so he went on past the door, happy in the thought\r\nthat his brother knew nothing of what had happened to him, and\r\nhastening his steps as if to spare the establishment all further worry.\r\nHowever, on emerging into the open sunshine of the street he felt a\r\ntouch of shame, and got into the cab with bent back and ashen face. He\r\nwas conscious that the fish market was gazing at him in triumph; it\r\nseemed to him, indeed, as though the whole neighbourhood had gathered\r\nthere to rejoice at his fall.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a villainous expression he\u2019s got!\u201D said Mademoiselle Saget.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, indeed, he looks just like a thief caught with his hand in\r\nsomebody\u2019s till,\u201D added Madame Lec\u0153ur.\r\n\r\n\u201CI once saw a man guillotined who looked exactly like he does,\u201D\r\nasserted La Sarriette, showing her white teeth.\r\n\r\nThey stepped forward, lengthened their necks, and tried to see into the\r\ncab. Just as it was starting, however, the old maid tugged sharply at\r\nthe skirts of her companions, and pointed to Claire, who was coming\r\nround the corner of the Rue Pirouette, looking like a mad creature,\r\nwith her hair loose and her nails bleeding. She had at last succeeded\r\nin opening her door. When she discovered that she was too late, and\r\nthat Florent was being taken off, she darted after the cab, but checked\r\nherself almost immediately with a gesture of impotent rage, and shook\r\nher fists at the receding wheels. Then, with her face quite crimson\r\nbeneath the fine plaster dust with which she was covered, she ran back\r\nagain towards the Rue Pirouette.\r\n\r\n\u201CHad he promised to marry her, eh?\u201D exclaimed La Sarriette, laughing.\r\n\u201CThe silly fool must be quite cracked.\u201D\r\n\r\nLittle by little the neighbourhood calmed down, though throughout the\r\nday groups of people constantly assembled and discussed the events of\r\nthe morning. The pork shop was the object of much inquisitive\r\ncuriosity. Lisa avoided appearing there, and left the counter in charge\r\nof Augustine. In the afternoon she felt bound to tell Quenu of what had\r\nhappened, for fear the news might cause him too great a shock should he\r\nhear it from some gossiping neighbour. She waited till she was alone\r\nwith him in the kitchen, knowing that there he was always most\r\ncheerful, and would weep less than if he were anywhere else. Moreover,\r\nshe communicated her tidings with all sorts of motherly precautions.\r\nNevertheless, as soon as he knew the truth he fell on the\r\nchopping-block, and began to cry like a calf.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, now, my poor dear, don\u2019t give way like that; you\u2019ll make yourself\r\nquite ill,\u201D exclaimed Lisa, taking him in her arms.\r\n\r\nHis tears were inundating his white apron, the whole of his massive,\r\ntorpid form quivered with grief. He seemed to be sinking, melting away.\r\nWhen he was at last able to speak, he stammered: \u201COh, you don\u2019t know\r\nhow good he was to me when we lived together in the Rue Royer-Collard!\r\nHe did everything. He swept the room and cooked the meals. He loved me\r\nas though I were his own child; and after his day\u2019s work he used to\r\ncome back splashed with mud, and so tired that he could scarcely move,\r\nwhile I stayed warm and comfortable in the house, and had nothing to do\r\nbut eat. And now they\u2019re going to shoot him!\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Lisa protested, saying that he would certainly not be shot. But\r\nQuenu only shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201CI haven\u2019t loved him half as much as I ought to have done,\u201D he\r\ncontinued. \u201CI can see that very well now. I had a wicked heart, and I\r\nhesitated about giving him his half of the money.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, I offered it to him a dozen times and more!\u201D Lisa interrupted.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure we\u2019ve nothing to reproach ourselves with.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes, I know that you are everything that is good, and that you\r\nwould have given him every copper. But I hesitated, I didn\u2019t like to\r\npart with it; and now it will be a sorrow to me for the rest of my\r\nlife. I shall always think that if I\u2019d shared the fortune with him he\r\nwouldn\u2019t have gone wrong a second time. Oh, yes; it\u2019s my fault! It is I\r\nwho have driven him to this.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Lisa, expostulating still more gently, assured him that he had\r\nnothing to blame himself for, and even expressed some pity for Florent.\r\nBut he was really very culpable, she said, and if he had had more money\r\nhe would probably have perpetrated greater follies. Gradually she gave\r\nher husband to understand that it was impossible matters could have had\r\nany other termination, and that now everything would go on much better.\r\nQuenu was still weeping, wiping his cheeks with his apron, trying to\r\nsuppress his sobs to listen to her, and then breaking into a wilder fit\r\nof tears than before. His fingers had mechanically sought a heap of\r\nsausage-meat lying on the block, and he was digging holes in it, and\r\nroughly kneading it together.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd how unwell you were feeling, you know,\u201D Lisa continued. \u201CIt was\r\nall because our life had got so shifted out of its usual course. I was\r\nvery anxious, though I didn\u2019t tell you so, at seeing you getting so\r\nlow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, wasn\u2019t I?\u201D he murmured, ceasing to sob for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd the business has been quite under a cloud this year. It was as\r\nthough a spell had been cast on it. Come, now, don\u2019t take on so; you\u2019ll\r\nsee that everything will look up again now. You must take care of\r\nyourself, you know, for my sake and your daughter\u2019s. You have duties to\r\nus as well as to others, remember.\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu was now kneading the sausage-meat more gently. Another burst of\r\nemotion was thrilling him, but it was a softer emotion, which was\r\nalready bringing a vague smile to his grief-stricken face. Lisa felt\r\nthat she had convinced him, and she turned and called to Pauline, who\r\nwas playing in the shop, and sat her on Quenu\u2019s knee.\r\n\r\n\u201CTell your father, Pauline, that he ought not to give way like this.\r\nAsk him nicely not to go on distressing us so.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe child did as she was told, and their fat, sleek forms united in a\r\ngeneral embrace. They all three looked at one another, already feeling\r\ncured of that twelve months\u2019 depression from which they had but just\r\nemerged. Their big, round faces smiled, and Lisa softly repeated, \u201CAnd\r\nafter all, my dear, there are only we three, you know, only we three.\u201D\r\n\r\nTwo months later Florent was again sentenced to transportation. The\r\naffair caused a great stir. The newspapers published all possible\r\ndetails, and gave portraits of the accused, sketches of the banners and\r\nscarves, and plans of the places where the conspirators had met. For a\r\nfortnight nothing but the great plot of the central markets was talked\r\nof in Paris. The police kept on launching more and more alarming\r\nreports, and it was at last even declared that the whole of the\r\nMontmartre Quarter was undermined. The excitement in the Corps\r\nL\u00E9gislatif was so intense that the members of the Centre and the Right\r\nforgot their temporary disagreement over the Imperial Grant Bill, and\r\nbecame reconciled. And then by an overwhelming majority they voted the\r\nunpopular tax, of which even the lower classes, in the panic which was\r\nsweeping over the city, dared no longer complain.\r\n\r\nThe trial lasted a week. Florent was very much surprised at the number\r\nof accomplices with which he found himself credited. Out of the twenty\r\nand more who were placed in the dock with him, he knew only some six or\r\nseven. After the sentence of the court had been read, he fancied he\r\ncould see Robine\u2019s innocent-looking hat and back going off quietly\r\nthrough the crowd. Logre was acquitted, as was also Lacaille; Alexandre\r\nwas sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment for his child-like complicity\r\nin the conspiracy; while as for Gavard, he, like Florent, was condemned\r\nto transportation. This was a heavy blow, which quite crushed him\r\namidst the final enjoyment that he derived from those lengthy\r\nproceedings in which he had managed to make himself so conspicuous. He\r\nwas paying very dearly for the way in which he had vented the spirit of\r\nperpetual opposition peculiar to the Paris shopkeeping classes. Two big\r\ntears coursed down his scared face\u2014the face of a white-haired child.\r\n\r\nAnd then one morning in August, amidst the busy awakening of the\r\nmarkets, Claude Lantier, sauntering about in the thick of the arriving\r\nvegetables, with his waist tightly girded by his red sash, came to\r\ngrasp Madame Francois\u2019s hand close by Saint Eustache. She was sitting\r\non her carrots and turnips, and her long face looked very sad. The\r\nartist, too, was gloomy, notwithstanding the bright sun which was\r\nalready softening the deep-green velvet of the mountains of cabbages.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, it\u2019s all over now,\u201D he said. \u201CThey are sending him back again.\r\nHe\u2019s already on his way to Brest, I believe.\u201D\r\n\r\nMadame Francois made a gesture of mute grief. Then she gently waved her\r\nhand around, and murmured in a low voice; \u201CAh, it is all Paris\u2019s doing,\r\nthis villainous Paris!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, not quite that; but I know whose doing it is, the contemptible\r\ncreatures!\u201D exclaimed Claude, clenching his fists. \u201CDo you know, Madame\r\nFrancois, there was nothing too ridiculous for those fellows in the\r\ncourt to say! Why, they even went ferreting in a child\u2019s copy-books!\r\nThat great idiot of a Public Prosecutor made a tremendous fuss over\r\nthem, and ranted about the respect due to children, and the wickedness\r\nof demagogical education! It makes me quite sick to think of it all!\u201D\r\n\r\nA shudder of disgust shook him, and then, burying himself more deeply\r\nin his discoloured cloak, he resumed: \u201CTo think of it! A man who was as\r\ngentle as a girl! Why, I saw him turn quite faint at seeing a pigeon\r\nkilled! I couldn\u2019t help smiling with pity when I saw him between two\r\ngendarmes. Ah, well, we shall never see him again! He won\u2019t come back\r\nthis time.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe ought to have listened to me,\u201D said Madame Francois, after a pause,\r\n\u201Cand have come to live at Nanterre with my fowls and rabbits. I was\r\nvery fond of him, you see, for I could tell that he was a good-hearted\r\nfellow. Ah, we might have been so happy together! It\u2019s a sad pity.\r\nWell, we must bear it as best we can, Monsieur Claude. Come and see me\r\none of these days. I\u2019ll have an omelet ready for you.\u201D\r\n\r\nHer eyes were dim with tears; but all at once she sprang up like a\r\nbrave woman who bears her sorrows with fortitude.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D she exclaimed, \u201Chere\u2019s old Mother Chantemesse coming to buy some\r\nturnips of me. The fat old lady\u2019s as sprightly as ever!\u201D\r\n\r\nClaude went off, and strolled about the footways. The dawn had risen in\r\nthe white sheaf of light at the end of the Rue Rambuteau; and the sun,\r\nnow level with the house-tops, was diffusing rosy rays which already\r\nfell in warm patches on the pavements. Claude was conscious of a gay\r\nawakening in the huge resonant markets\u2014indeed, all over the\r\nneighbourhood\u2014crowded with piles of food. It was like the joy that\r\ncomes after cure, the mirth of folks who are at last relieved of a\r\nheavy weight which has been pulling them down. He saw La Sarriette\r\ndisplaying a gold chain and singing amidst her plums and strawberries,\r\nwhile she playfully pulled the moustaches of Monsieur Jules, who was\r\narrayed in a velvet jacket. He also caught sight of Madame Lec\u0153ur and\r\nMademoiselle Saget passing along one of the covered ways, and looking\r\nless sallow than usual\u2014indeed, almost rosy\u2014as they laughed like bosom\r\nfriends over some amusing story. In the fish market, old Madame\r\nMehudin, who had returned to her stall, was slapping her fish, abusing\r\ncustomers, and snubbing the new inspector, a presumptuous young man\r\nwhom she had sworn to spank; while Claire, seemingly more languid and\r\nindolent than ever, extended her hands, blue from immersion in the\r\nwater of her tanks, to gather together a great heap of edible snails,\r\nshimmering with silvery slime. In the tripe market Auguste and\r\nAugustine, with the foolish expression of newly-married people, had\r\njust been purchasing some pigs\u2019 trotters, and were starting off in a\r\ntrap for their pork shop at Montrouge. Then, as it was now eight\r\no\u2019clock and already quite warm, Claude, on again coming to the Rue\r\nRambuteau, perceived Muche and Pauline playing at horses. Muche was\r\ncrawling along on all-fours, while Pauline sat on his back, and clung\r\nto his hair to keep herself from falling. However, a moving shadow\r\nwhich fell from the eaves of the market roof made Claude look up; and\r\nhe then espied Cadine and Marjolin aloft, kissing and warming\r\nthemselves in the sunshine, parading their loves before the whole\r\nneighbourhood like a pair of light-hearted animals.\r\n\r\nClaude shook his fist at them. All this joyousness down below and on\r\nhigh exasperated him. He reviled the Fat; the Fat, he declared, had\r\nconquered the Thin. All around him he could see none but the Fat\r\nprotruding their paunches, bursting with robust health, and greeting\r\nwith delight another day of gorging and digestion. And a last blow was\r\ndealt to him by the spectacle which he perceived on either hand as he\r\nhalted opposite the Rue Pirouette.\r\n\r\nOn his right, the beautiful Norman, or the beautiful Madame Lebigre, as\r\nshe was now called, stood at the door of her shop. Her husband had at\r\nlength been granted the privilege of adding a State tobacco agency[*]\r\nto his wine shop, a long-cherished dream of his which he had finally\r\nbeen able to realise through the great services he had rendered to the\r\nauthorities. And to Claude the beautiful Madame Lebigre looked superb,\r\nwith her silk dress and her frizzed hair, quite ready to take her seat\r\nbehind her counter, whither all the gentlemen in the neighbourhood\r\nflocked to buy their cigars and packets of tobacco. She had become\r\nquite distinguished, quite the lady. The shop behind her had been newly\r\npainted, with borders of twining vine-branches showing against a soft\r\nbackground; the zinc-plated wine-counter gleamed brightly, and in the\r\ntall mirror the flasks of liqueurs set brighter flashes of colour than\r\never. And the mistress of all these things stood smiling radiantly at\r\nthe bright sunshine.\r\n\r\n[*] Most readers will remember that the tobacco trade is a State\r\nmonopoly in France. The retail tobacconists are merely Government\r\nagents.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, on Claude\u2019s left, the beautiful Lisa blocked up the doorway of\r\nher shop as she stood on the threshold. Never before had her linen\r\nshone with such dazzling whiteness; never had her serene face and rosy\r\ncheeks appeared in a more lustrous setting of glossy locks. She\r\ndisplayed the deep calmness of repletion, a massive tranquillity\r\nunruffled even by a smile. She was a picture of absolute quietude, of\r\nperfect felicity, not only cloudless but lifeless, the simple felicity\r\nof basking in the warm atmosphere. Her tightly stretched bodice seemed\r\nto be still digesting the happiness of yesterday; while her dimpled\r\nhands, hidden in the folds of her apron, did not even trouble to grasp\r\nat the happiness of to-day, certain as they were that it would come of\r\nitself. And the shop-window at her side seemed to display the same\r\nfelicity. It had recovered from its former blight; the tongues lolled\r\nout, red and healthy; the hams had regained their old chubbiness of\r\nform; the festoons of sausages no longer wore that mournful air which\r\nhad so greatly distressed Quenu. Hearty laughter, accompanied by a\r\njubilant clattering of pans, sounded from the kitchen in the rear. The\r\nwhole place again reeked with fat health. The flitches of bacon and the\r\nsides of pork that hung against the marble showed roundly like\r\npaunches, triumphant paunches, whilst Lisa, with her imposing breadth\r\nof shoulders and dignity of mien, bade the markets good morning with\r\nthose big eyes of hers which so clearly bespoke a gross feeder.\r\n\r\nHowever, the two women bowed to each other. Beautiful Madame Lebigre\r\nand beautiful Madame Quenu exchanged a friendly salute.\r\n\r\nAnd then Claude, who had certainly forgotten to dine on the previous\r\nday, was thrilled with anger at seeing them standing there, looking so\r\nhealthy and well-to-do with their buxom bosoms; and tightening his\r\nsash, he growled in a tone of irritation:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat blackguards respectable people are!\u201D\r\n\r\n

\r\n\r\n(LE VENTRE DE PARIS)\r\n\r\nby \u00C9mile Zola\r\n\r\nTranslated, With An Introduction, By Ernest Alfred Vizetelly\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n INTRODUCTION\r\n CHAPTER I\r\n CHAPTER II\r\n CHAPTER III\r\n CHAPTER IV\r\n CHAPTER V\r\n CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me have men about me that are fat: Sleek-headed men, and such as\r\nsleep o\u2019 nights: Yond\u2019 Cassius has a lean and hungry look; He thinks\r\ntoo much: such men are dangerous. SHAKESPEARE: _Julius Caesar_, act i,\r\nsc. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CTHE FAT AND THE THIN,\u201D or, to use the French title, \u201CLe Ventre de\r\nParis,\u201D is a story of life in and around those vast Central Markets\r\nwhich form a distinctive feature of modern Paris. Even the reader who\r\nhas never crossed the Channel must have heard of the Parisian _Halles_,\r\nfor much has been written about them, not only in English books on the\r\nFrench metropolis, but also in English newspapers, magazines, and\r\nreviews; so that few, I fancy, will commence the perusal of the present\r\nvolume without having, at all events, some knowledge of its subject\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe Paris markets form such a world of their own, and teem at certain\r\nhours of the day and night with such exuberance of life, that it was\r\nonly natural they should attract the attention of a novelist like M.\r\nZola, who, to use his own words, delights \u201Cin any subject in which vast\r\nmasses of people can be shown in motion.\u201D Mr. Sherard tells us[*] that\r\nthe idea of \u201CLe Ventre de Paris\u201D first occurred to M. Zola in 1872,\r\nwhen he used continually to take his friend Paul Alexis for a ramble\r\nthrough the Halles. I have in my possession, however, an article\r\nwritten by M. Zola some five or six years before that time, and in this\r\none can already detect the germ of the present work; just as the motif\r\nof another of M. Zola\u2019s novels, \u201CLa Joie de Vivre,\u201D can be traced to a\r\nshort story written for a Russian review.\r\n\r\n[*] _Emile Zola: a Biographical and Critical Study_, by Robert\r\nHarborough Sherard, pp. 103, 104. London, Chatto & Windus, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar instances are frequently to be found in the writings of English\r\nas well as French novelists, and are, of course, easily explained. A\r\nyoung man unknown to fame, and unable to procure the publication of a\r\nlong novel, often contents himself with embodying some particular idea\r\nin a short sketch or story, which finds its way into one or another\r\nperiodical, where it lies buried and forgotten by everybody\u2014excepting\r\nits author. Time goes by, however, the writer achieves some measure of\r\nsuccess, and one day it occurs to him to elaborate and perfect that old\r\nidea of his, only a faint _apercu_ of which, for lack of opportunity,\r\nhe had been able to give in the past. With a little research, no doubt,\r\nan interesting essay might be written on these literary resuscitations;\r\nbut if one except certain novelists who are so deficient in ideas that\r\nthey continue writing and rewriting the same story throughout their\r\nlives, it will, I think, be generally found that the revivals in\r\nquestion are due to some such reason as that given above.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that the article of M. Zola\u2019s young days to\r\nwhich I have referred is not one on market life in particular, but one\r\non violets. It contains, however, a vigorous, if brief, picture of the\r\nHalles in the small hours of the morning, and is instinct with that\r\nrealistic descriptive power of which M. Zola has since given so many\r\nproofs. We hear the rumbling and clattering of the market carts, we see\r\nthe piles of red meat, the baskets of silvery fish, the mountains of\r\nvegetables, green and white; in a few paragraphs the whole market world\r\npasses in kaleidoscopic fashion before our eyes by the pale, dancing\r\nlight of the gas lamps and the lanterns. Several years after the paper\r\nI speak of was published, when M. Zola began to issue \u201CLe Ventre de\r\nParis,\u201D M. Tournachon, better known as Nadar, the aeronaut and\r\nphotographer, rushed into print to proclaim that the realistic novelist\r\nhad simply pilfered his ideas from an account of the Halles which he\r\n(Tournachon) had but lately written. M. Zola, as is so often his wont,\r\nscorned to reply to this charge of plagiarism; but, had he chosen, he\r\ncould have promptly settled the matter by producing his own forgotten\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of passing for a literary ghoul, I propose to exhume some\r\nportion of the paper in question, as, so far as translation can avail,\r\nit will show how M. Zola wrote and what he thought in 1867. After the\r\ndescription of the markets to which I have alluded, there comes the\r\nfollowing passage:\u2014\r\n\r\nI was gazing at the preparations for the great daily orgy of Paris when\r\nI espied a throng of people bustling suspiciously in a corner. A few\r\nlanterns threw a yellow light upon this crowd. Children, women, and men\r\nwith outstretched hands were fumbling in dark piles which extended\r\nalong the footway. I thought that those piles must be remnants of meat\r\nsold for a trifling price, and that all those wretched people were\r\nrushing upon them to feed. I drew near, and discovered my mistake. The\r\nheaps were not heaps of meat, but heaps of violets. All the flowery\r\npoesy of the streets of Paris lay there, on that muddy pavement, amidst\r\nmountains of food. The gardeners of the suburbs had brought their\r\nsweet-scented harvests to the markets and were disposing of them to the\r\nhawkers. From the rough fingers of their peasant growers the violets\r\nwere passing to the dirty hands of those who would cry them in the\r\nstreets. At winter time it is between four and six o\u2019clock in the\r\nmorning that the flowers of Paris are thus sold at the Halles. Whilst\r\nthe city sleeps and its butchers are getting all ready for its daily\r\nattack of indigestion, a trade in poetry is plied in dark, dank\r\ncorners. When the sun rises the bright red meat will be displayed in\r\ntrim, carefully dressed joints, and the violets, mounted on bits of\r\nosier, will gleam softly within their elegant collars of green leaves.\r\nBut when they arrive, in the dark night, the bullocks, already ripped\r\nopen, discharge black blood, and the trodden flowers lie prone upon the\r\nfootways. . . . I noticed just in front of me one large bunch which had\r\nslipped off a neighbouring mound and was almost bathing in the gutter.\r\nI picked it up. Underneath, it was soiled with mud; the greasy, fetid\r\nsewer water had left black stains upon the flowers. And then, gazing at\r\nthese exquisite daughters of our gardens and our woods, astray amidst\r\nall the filth of the city, I began to ponder. On what woman\u2019s bosom\r\nwould those wretched flowerets open and bloom? Some hawker would dip\r\nthem in a pail of water, and of all the bitter odours of the Paris mud\r\nthey would retain but a slight pungency, which would remain mingled\r\nwith their own sweet perfume. The water would remove their stains, they\r\nwould pale somewhat, and become a joy both for the smell and for the\r\nsight. Nevertheless, in the depths of each corolla there would still\r\nremain some particle of mud suggestive of impurity. And I asked myself\r\nhow much love and passion was represented by all those heaps of flowers\r\nshivering in the bleak wind. To how many loving ones, and how many\r\nindifferent ones, and how many egotistical ones, would all those\r\nthousands and thousands of violets go! In a few hours\u2019 time they would\r\nbe scattered to the four corners of Paris, and for a paltry copper the\r\npassers-by would purchase a glimpse and a whiff of springtide in the\r\nmuddy streets.\r\n\r\nImperfect as the rendering may be, I think that the above passage will\r\nshow that M. Zola was already possessed of a large amount of his\r\nacknowledged realistic power at the early date I have mentioned. I\r\nshould also have liked to quote a rather amusing story of a priggish\r\nPhilistine who ate violets with oil and vinegar, strongly peppered, but\r\nconsiderations of space forbid; so I will pass to another passage,\r\nwhich is of more interest and importance. Both French and English\r\ncritics have often contended that although M. Zola is a married man, he\r\nknows very little of women, as there has virtually never been any\r\n_feminine romance_ in his life. There are those who are aware of the\r\ncontrary, but whose tongues are stayed by considerations of delicacy\r\nand respect. Still, as the passage I am now about to reproduce is\r\nsigned and acknowledged as fact by M. Zola himself, I see no harm in\r\nslightly raising the veil from a long-past episode in the master\u2019s\r\nlife:\u2014\r\n\r\nThe light was rising, and as I stood there before that footway\r\ntransformed into a bed of flowers my strange night-fancies gave place\r\nto recollections at once sweet and sad. I thought of my last excursion\r\nto Fontenay-aux-Roses, with the loved one, the good fairy of my\r\ntwentieth year. Springtime was budding into birth, the tender foliage\r\ngleamed in the pale April sunshine. The little pathway skirting the\r\nhill was bordered by large fields of violets. As one passed along, a\r\nstrong perfume seemed to penetrate one and make one languid. _She_ was\r\nleaning on my arm, faint with love from the sweet odour of the flowers.\r\nA whiteness hovered over the country-side, little insects buzzed in the\r\nsunshine, deep silence fell from the heavens, and so low was the sound\r\nof our kisses that not a bird in all the hedges showed sign of fear. At\r\na turn of the path we perceived some old bent women, who with dry,\r\nwithered hands were hurriedly gathering violets and throwing them into\r\nlarge baskets. She who was with me glanced longingly at the flowers,\r\nand I called one of the women. \u201CYou want some violets?\u201D said she. \u201CHow\r\nmuch? A pound?\u201D\r\n\r\nGod of Heaven! She sold her flowers by the pound! We fled in deep\r\ndistress. It seemed as though the country-side had been transformed\r\ninto a huge grocer\u2019s shop. . . . Then we ascended to the woods of\r\nVerrieres, and there, in the grass, under the soft, fresh foliage, we\r\nfound some tiny violets which seemed to be dreadfully afraid, and\r\ncontrived to hide themselves with all sorts of artful ruses. During two\r\nlong hours I scoured the grass and peered into every nook, and as soon\r\nas ever I found a fresh violet I carried it to her. She bought it of\r\nme, and the price that I exacted was a kiss. . . . And I thought of all\r\nthose things, of all that happiness, amidst the hubbub of the markets\r\nof Paris, before those poor dead flowers whose graveyard the footway\r\nhad become. I remembered my good fairy, who is now dead and gone, and\r\nthe little bouquet of dry violets which I still preserve in a drawer.\r\nWhen I returned home I counted their withered stems: there were twenty\r\nof them, and over my lips there passed the gentle warmth of my loved\r\none\u2019s twenty kisses.\r\n\r\nAnd now from violets I must, with a brutality akin to that which M.\r\nZola himself displays in some of his transitions, pass to very\r\ndifferent things, for some time back a well-known English poet and\r\nessayist wrote of the present work that it was redolent of pork,\r\nonions, and cheese. To one of his sensitive temperament, with a muse\r\nstrictly nourished on sugar and water, such gross edibles as pork and\r\ncheese and onions were peculiarly offensive. That humble plant the\r\nonion, employed to flavour wellnigh every savoury dish, can assuredly\r\nneed no defence; in most European countries, too, cheese has long been\r\nknown as the poor man\u2019s friend; whilst as for pork, apart from all\r\nother considerations, I can claim for it a distinct place in English\r\nliterature. A greater essayist by far than the critic to whom I am\r\nreferring, a certain Mr. Charles Lamb, of the India House, has left us\r\nan immortal page on the origin of roast pig and crackling. And, when\r\neverything is considered, I should much like to know why novels should\r\nbe confined to the aspirations of the soul, and why they should not\r\nalso treat of the requirements of our physical nature? From the days of\r\nantiquity we have all known what befell the members when, guided by the\r\nbrain, they were foolish enough to revolt against the stomach. The\r\nlatter plays a considerable part not only in each individual organism,\r\nbut also in the life of the world. Over and over again\u2014I could adduce a\r\nscore of historical examples\u2014it has thwarted the mightiest designs of\r\nthe human mind. We mortals are much addicted to talking of our minds\r\nand our souls and treating our bodies as mere dross. But I hold\u2014it is a\r\npersonal opinion\u2014that in the vast majority of cases the former are\r\nlargely governed by the last. I conceive, therefore, that a novel which\r\ntakes our daily sustenance as one of its themes has the best of all\r\n_raisons d\u2019\u00EAtre_. A foreign writer of far more consequence and ability\r\nthan myself\u2014Signor Edmondo de Amicis\u2014has proclaimed the present book to\r\nbe \u201Cone of the most original and happiest inventions of French genius,\u201D\r\nand I am strongly inclined to share his opinion.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the work does not merely treat of the\r\nprovisioning of a great city. That provisioning is its _scenario_; but\r\nit also embraces a powerful allegory, the prose song of \u201Cthe eternal\r\nbattle between the lean of this world and the fat\u2014a battle in which, as\r\nthe author shows, the latter always come off successful. It is, too, in\r\nits way an allegory of the triumph of the fat bourgeois, who lives well\r\nand beds softly, over the gaunt and Ishmael artist\u2014an allegory which M.\r\nZola has more than once introduced into his pages, another notable\r\ninstance thereof being found in \u2018Germinal,\u2019 with the fat, well-fed\r\nGregoires on the one hand, and the starving Maheus on the other.\u201D\r\n\r\nFrom this quotation from Mr. Sherard\u2019s pages it will be gathered that\r\nM. Zola had a distinct social aim in writing this book. Wellnigh the\r\nwhole social question may, indeed, be summed up in the words \u201Cfood and\r\ncomfort\u201D; and in a series of novels like \u201CLes Rougon-Macquart,\u201D dealing\r\nfirstly with different conditions and grades of society, and, secondly,\r\nwith the influence which the Second Empire exercised on France, the\r\npresent volume necessarily had its place marked out from the very\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherard has told us of all the labour which M. Zola expended on the\r\npreparation of the work, of his multitudinous visits to the Paris\r\nmarkets, his patient investigation of their organism, and his keen\r\nartistic interest in their manifold phases of life. And bred as I was\r\nin Paris, a partaker as I have been of her exultations and her woes\r\nthey have always had for me a strong attraction. My memory goes back to\r\nthe earlier years of their existence, and I can well remember many of\r\nthe old surroundings which have now disappeared. I can recollect the\r\nlast vestiges of the antique _piliers_, built by Francis I, facing the\r\nRue de la Tonnellerie. Paul Niquet\u2019s, with its \u201Cbowel-twisting brandy\u201D\r\nand its crew of drunken ragpickers, was certainly before my time; but I\r\ncan readily recall Baratte\u2019s and Bordier\u2019s and all the folly and\r\nprodigality which raged there; I knew, too, several of the noted\r\nthieves\u2019 haunts which took the place of Niquet\u2019s, and which one was\r\ncareful never to enter without due precaution. And then, when the\r\nGerman armies were beleaguering Paris, and two millions of people were\r\nshut off from the world, I often strolled to the Halles to view their\r\nstrangely altered aspect. The fish pavilion, of which M. Zola has so\r\nmuch to say, was bare and deserted. The railway drays, laden with the\r\ncomestible treasures of the ocean, no longer thundered through the\r\ncovered ways. At the most one found an auction going on in one or\r\nanother corner, and a few Seine eels or gudgeons fetching wellnigh\r\ntheir weight in gold. Then, in the butter and cheese pavilions, one\r\ncould only procure some nauseous melted fat, while in the meat\r\ndepartment horse and mule and donkey took the place of beef and veal\r\nand mutton. Mule and donkey were very scarce, and commanded high\r\nprices, but both were of better flavour than horse; mule, indeed, being\r\nquite a delicacy. I also well remember a stall at which dog was sold,\r\nand, hunger knowing no law, I once purchased, cooked, and ate a couple\r\nof canine cutlets which cost me two francs apiece. The flesh was pinky\r\nand very tender, yet I would not willingly make such a repast again.\r\nHowever, peace and plenty at last came round once more, the Halles\r\nregained their old-time aspect, and in the years which followed I more\r\nthan once saw the dawn rise slowly over the mounds of cabbages,\r\ncarrots, leeks, and pumpkins, even as M. Zola describes in the\r\nfollowing pages. He has, I think, depicted with remarkable accuracy and\r\nartistic skill the many varying effects of colour that are produced as\r\nthe climbing sun casts its early beams on the giant larder and its\r\nmasses of food\u2014effects of colour which, to quote a famous saying of the\r\nfirst Napoleon, show that \u201Cthe markets of Paris are the Louvre of the\r\npeople\u201D in more senses than one.\r\n\r\nThe reader will bear in mind that the period dealt with by the author\r\nin this work is that of 1857-60, when the new Halles Centrales were yet\r\nyoung, and indeed not altogether complete. Still, although many old\r\nlandmarks have long since been swept away, the picture of life in all\r\nessential particulars remained the same. Prior to 1860 the limits of\r\nParis were the so-called _boulevards exterieurs_, from which a girdle\r\nof suburbs, such as Montmartre, Belleville, Passy, and Montrouge,\r\nextended to the fortifications; and the population of the city was then\r\nonly 1,400,000 souls. Some of the figures which will be found scattered\r\nthrough M. Zola\u2019s work must therefore be taken as applying entirely to\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nNowadays the amount of business transacted at the Halles has very\r\nlargely increased, in spite of the multiplication of district markets.\r\nParis seems to have an insatiable appetite, though, on the other hand,\r\nits cuisine is fast becoming all simplicity. To my thinking, few more\r\nremarkable changes have come over the Parisians of recent years than\r\nthis change of diet. One by one great restaurants, formerly renowned\r\nfor particular dishes and special wines, have been compelled through\r\nlack of custom to close their doors; and this has not been caused so\r\nmuch by inability to defray the cost of high feeding as by inability to\r\nindulge in it with impunity in a physical sense. In fact, Paris has\r\nbecome a city of impaired digestions, which nowadays seek the\r\nsimplicity without the heaviness of the old English cuisine; and,\r\nshould things continue in their present course, I fancy that Parisians\r\nanxious for high feeding will ultimately have to cross over to our side\r\nof the Channel.\r\n\r\nThese remarks, I trust, will not be considered out of place in an\r\nintroduction to a work which to no small extent treats of the appetite\r\nof Paris. The reader will find that the characters portrayed by M. Zola\r\nare all types of humble life, but I fail to see that their\r\ncircumstances should render them any the less interesting. A faithful\r\nportrait of a shopkeeper, a workman, or a workgirl is artistically of\r\nfar more value than all the imaginary sketches of impossible dukes and\r\ngood and wicked baronets in which so many English novels abound.\r\nSeveral of M. Zola\u2019s personages seem to me extremely lifelike\u2014Gavard,\r\nindeed, is a _chef-d\u2019oeuvre_ of portraiture: I have known many men like\r\nhim; and no one who lived in Paris under the Empire can deny the\r\naccuracy with which the author has delineated his hero Florent, the\r\ndreamy and hapless revolutionary caught in the toils of others. In\r\nthose days, too, there was many such a plot as M. Zola describes,\r\ninstigated by agents like Logre and Lebigre, and allowed to mature till\r\nthe eve of an election or some other important event which rendered its\r\nexposure desirable for the purpose of influencing public opinion. In\r\nfact, in all that relates to the so-called \u201Cconspiracy of the markets,\u201D\r\nM. Zola, whilst changing time and place to suit the requirements of his\r\nstory, has simply followed historical lines. As for the Quenus, who\r\nplay such prominent parts in the narrative, the husband is a weakling\r\nwith no soul above his stewpans, whilst his wife, the beautiful Lisa,\r\nin reality wears the breeches and rules the roast. The manner in which\r\nshe cures Quenu of his political proclivities, though savouring of\r\npersuasiveness rather than violence, is worthy of the immortal Mrs.\r\nCaudle: Douglas Jerrold might have signed a certain lecture which she\r\nadministers to her astounded helpmate. Of Pauline, the Quenus\u2019\r\ndaughter, we see but little in the story, but she becomes the heroine\r\nof another of M. Zola\u2019s novels, \u201CLa Joie de Vivre,\u201D and instead of\r\ninheriting the egotism of her parents, develops a passionate love and\r\ndevotion for others. In a like way Claude Lantier, Florent\u2019s artist\r\nfriend and son of Gervaise of the \u201CAssommoir,\u201D figures more\r\nparticularly in \u201CL\u2019Oeuvre,\u201D which tells how his painful struggle for\r\nfame resulted in madness and suicide. With reference to the beautiful\r\nNorman and the other fishwives and gossips scattered through the\r\npresent volume, and those genuine types of Parisian _gaminerie_, Muche,\r\nMarjolin, and Cadine, I may mention that I have frequently chastened\r\ntheir language in deference to English susceptibilities, so that the\r\nstory, whilst retaining every essential feature, contains nothing to\r\nwhich exception can reasonably be taken.\r\n\r\nE. A. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAT AND THE THIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nAmidst the deep silence and solitude prevailing in the avenue several\r\nmarket gardeners\u2019 carts were climbing the slope which led towards\r\nParis, and the fronts of the houses, asleep behind the dim lines of\r\nelms on either side of the road, echoed back the rhythmical jolting of\r\nthe wheels. At the Neuilly bridge a cart full of cabbages and another\r\nfull of peas had joined the eight waggons of carrots and turnips coming\r\ndown from Nanterre; and the horses, left to themselves, had continued\r\nplodding along with lowered heads, at a regular though lazy pace, which\r\nthe ascent of the slope now slackened. The sleeping waggoners, wrapped\r\nin woollen cloaks, striped black and grey, and grasping the reins\r\nslackly in their closed hands, were stretched at full length on their\r\nstomachs atop of the piles of vegetables. Every now and then, a gas\r\nlamp, following some patch of gloom, would light up the hobnails of a\r\nboot, the blue sleeve of a blouse, or the peak of a cap peering out of\r\nthe huge florescence of vegetables\u2014red bouquets of carrots, white\r\nbouquets of turnips, and the overflowing greenery of peas and cabbages.\r\n\r\nAnd all along the road, and along the neighbouring roads, in front and\r\nbehind, the distant rumbling of vehicles told of the presence of\r\nsimilar contingents of the great caravan which was travelling onward\r\nthrough the gloom and deep slumber of that matutinal hour, lulling the\r\ndark city to continued repose with its echoes of passing food.\r\n\r\nMadame Francois\u2019s horse, Balthazar, an animal that was far too fat, led\r\nthe van. He was plodding on, half asleep and wagging his ears, when\r\nsuddenly, on reaching the Rue de Longchamp, he quivered with fear and\r\ncame to a dead stop. The horses behind, thus unexpectedly checked, ran\r\ntheir heads against the backs of the carts in front of them, and the\r\nprocession halted amidst a clattering of bolts and chains and the oaths\r\nof the awakened waggoners. Madame Francois, who sat in front of her\r\nvehicle, with her back to a board which kept her vegetables in\r\nposition, looked down; but, in the dim light thrown to the left by a\r\nsmall square lantern, which illuminated little beyond one of\r\nBalthazar\u2019s sheeny flanks, she could distinguish nothing.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, old woman, let\u2019s get on!\u201D cried one of the men, who had raised\r\nhimself to a kneeling position amongst his turnips; \u201Cit\u2019s only some\r\ndrunken sot.\u201D\r\n\r\nMadame Francois, however, had bent forward and on her right hand had\r\ncaught sight of a black mass, lying almost under the horse\u2019s hoofs, and\r\nblocking the road.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou wouldn\u2019t have us drive over a man, would you?\u201D said she, jumping\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a man lying at full length upon the road, with his arms\r\nstretched out and his face in the dust. He seemed to be remarkably\r\ntall, but as withered as a dry branch, and the wonder was that\r\nBalthazar had not broken him in half with a blow from his hoof. Madame\r\nFrancois thought that he was dead; but on stooping and taking hold of\r\none of his hands, she found that it was quite warm.\r\n\r\n\u201CPoor fellow!\u201D she murmured softly.\r\n\r\nThe waggoners, however, were getting impatient.\r\n\r\n\u201CHurry up, there!\u201D said the man kneeling amongst the turnips, in a\r\nhoarse voice. \u201CHe\u2019s drunk till he can hold no more, the hog! Shove him\r\ninto the gutter.\u201D\r\n\r\nMeantime, the man on the road had opened his eyes. He looked at Madame\r\nFrancois with a startled air, but did not move. She herself now thought\r\nthat he must indeed be drunk.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou mustn\u2019t stop here,\u201D she said to him, \u201Cor you\u2019ll get run over and\r\nkilled. Where were you going?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D replied the man in a faint voice.\r\n\r\nThen, with an effort and an anxious expression, he added: \u201CI was going\r\nto Paris; I fell down, and don\u2019t remember any more.\u201D\r\n\r\nMadame Francois could now see him more distinctly, and he was truly a\r\npitiable object, with his ragged black coat and trousers, through the\r\nrents in which you could espy his scraggy limbs. Underneath a black\r\ncloth cap, which was drawn low over his brows, as though he were afraid\r\nof being recognised, could be seen two large brown eyes, gleaming with\r\npeculiar softness in his otherwise stern and harassed countenance. It\r\nseemed to Madame Francois that he was in far too famished a condition\r\nto have got drunk.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what part of Paris were you going to?\u201D she continued.\r\n\r\nThe man did not reply immediately. This questioning seemed to distress\r\nhim. He appeared to be thinking the matter over, but at last said\r\nhesitatingly, \u201COver yonder, towards the markets.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe had now, with great difficulty, got to his feet again, and seemed\r\nanxious to resume his journey. But Madame Francois noticed that he\r\ntottered, and clung for support to one of the shafts of her waggon.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you tired?\u201D she asked him.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, very tired,\u201D he replied.\r\n\r\nThen she suddenly assumed a grumpy tone, as though displeased, and,\r\ngiving him a push, exclaimed: \u201CLook sharp, then, and climb into my\r\ncart. You\u2019ve made us lose a lot of time. I\u2019m going to the markets, and\r\nI\u2019ll turn you out there with my vegetables.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as the man seemed inclined to refuse her offer, she pushed him up\r\nwith her stout arms, and bundled him down upon the turnips and carrots.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, now, don\u2019t give us any more trouble,\u201D she cried angrily. \u201CYou\r\nare quite enough to provoke one, my good fellow. Don\u2019t I tell you that\r\nI\u2019m going to the markets? Sleep away up there. I\u2019ll wake you when we\r\narrive.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe herself then clambered into the cart again, and settled herself\r\nwith her back against the board, grasping the reins of Balthazar, who\r\nstarted off drowsily, swaying his ears once more. The other waggons\r\nfollowed, and the procession resumed its lazy march through the\r\ndarkness, whilst the rhythmical jolting of the wheels again awoke the\r\nechoes of the sleepy house fronts, and the waggoners, wrapped in their\r\ncloaks, dozed off afresh. The one who had called to Madame Francois\r\ngrowled out as he lay down: \u201CAs if we\u2019d nothing better to do than pick\r\nup every drunken sot we come across! You\u2019re a scorcher, old woman!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe waggons rumbled on, and the horses picked their own way, with\r\ndrooping heads. The stranger whom Madame Francois had befriended was\r\nlying on his stomach, with his long legs lost amongst the turnips which\r\nfilled the back part of the cart, whilst his face was buried amidst the\r\nspreading piles of carrot bunches. With weary, extended arms he\r\nclutched hold of his vegetable couch in fear of being thrown to the\r\nground by one of the waggon\u2019s jolts, and his eyes were fixed on the two\r\nlong lines of gas lamps which stretched away in front of him till they\r\nmingled with a swarm of other lights in the distance atop of the slope.\r\nFar away on the horizon floated a spreading, whitish vapour, showing\r\nwhere Paris slept amidst the luminous haze of all those flamelets.\r\n\r\n\u201CI come from Nanterre, and my name\u2019s Madame Francois,\u201D said the market\r\ngardener presently. \u201CSince my poor man died I go to the markets every\r\nmorning myself. It\u2019s a hard life, as you may guess. And who are you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy name\u2019s Florent, I come from a distance,\u201D replied the stranger, with\r\nembarrassment. \u201CPlease excuse me, but I\u2019m really so tired that it is\r\npainful to me to talk.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe was evidently unwilling to say anything more, and so Madame Francois\r\nrelapsed into silence, and allowed the reins to fall loosely on the\r\nback of Balthazar, who went his way like an animal acquainted with\r\nevery stone of the road.\r\n\r\nMeantime, with his eyes still fixed upon the far-spreading glare of\r\nParis, Florent was pondering over the story which he had refused to\r\ncommunicate to Madame Francois. After making his escape from Cayenne,\r\nwhither he had been transported for his participation in the resistance\r\nto Louis Napoleon\u2019s Coup d\u2019Etat, he had wandered about Dutch Guiana for\r\na couple of years, burning to return to France, yet dreading the\r\nImperial police. At last, however, he once more saw before him the\r\nbeloved and mighty city which he had so keenly regretted and so\r\nardently longed for. He would hide himself there, he told himself, and\r\nagain lead the quiet, peaceable life that he had lived years ago. The\r\npolice would never be any the wiser; and everyone would imagine,\r\nindeed, that he had died over yonder, across the sea. Then he thought\r\nof his arrival at Havre, where he had landed with only some fifteen\r\nfrancs tied up in a corner of his handkerchief. He had been able to pay\r\nfor a seat in the coach as far as Rouen, but from that point he had\r\nbeen forced to continue his journey on foot, as he had scarcely thirty\r\nsous left of his little store. At Vernon his last copper had gone in\r\nbread. After that he had no clear recollection of anything. He fancied\r\nthat he could remember having slept for several hours in a ditch, and\r\nhaving shown the papers with which he had provided himself to a\r\ngendarme; however, he had only a very confused idea of what had\r\nhappened. He had left Vernon without any breakfast, seized every now\r\nand then with hopeless despair and raging pangs which had driven him to\r\nmunch the leaves of the hedges as he tramped along. A prey to cramp and\r\nfright, his body bent, his sight dimmed, and his feet sore, he had\r\ncontinued his weary march, ever drawn onwards in a semi-unconscious\r\nstate by a vision of Paris, which, far, far away, beyond the horizon,\r\nseemed to be summoning him and waiting for him.\r\n\r\nWhen he at length reached Courbevoie, the night was very dark. Paris,\r\nlooking like a patch of star-sprent sky that had fallen upon the black\r\nearth, seemed to him to wear a forbidding aspect, as though angry at\r\nhis return. Then he felt very faint, and his legs almost gave way\r\nbeneath him as he descended the hill. As he crossed the Neuilly bridge\r\nhe sustained himself by clinging to the parapet, and bent over and\r\nlooked at the Seine rolling inky waves between its dense, massy banks.\r\nA red lamp on the water seemed to be watching him with a sanguineous\r\neye. And then he had to climb the hill if he would reach Paris on its\r\nsummit yonder. The hundreds of leagues which he had already travelled\r\nwere as nothing to it. That bit of a road filled him with despair. He\r\nwould never be able, he thought, to reach yonder light crowned summit.\r\nThe spacious avenue lay before him with its silence and its darkness,\r\nits lines of tall trees and low houses, its broad grey footwalks,\r\nspeckled with the shadows of overhanging branches, and parted\r\noccasionally by the gloomy gaps of side streets. The squat yellow\r\nflames of the gas lamps, standing erect at regular intervals, alone\r\nimparted a little life to the lonely wilderness. And Florent seemed to\r\nmake no progress; the avenue appeared to grow ever longer and longer,\r\nto be carrying Paris away into the far depths of the night. At last he\r\nfancied that the gas lamps, with their single eyes, were running off on\r\neither hand, whisking the road away with them; and then, overcome by\r\nvertigo, he stumbled and fell on the roadway like a log.\r\n\r\nNow he was lying at ease on his couch of greenery, which seemed to him\r\nsoft as a feather bed. He had slightly raised his head so as to keep\r\nhis eyes on the luminous haze which was spreading above the dark roofs\r\nwhich he could divine on the horizon. He was nearing his goal, carried\r\nalong towards it, with nothing to do but to yield to the leisurely\r\njolts of the waggon; and, free from all further fatigue, he now only\r\nsuffered from hunger. Hunger, indeed, had once more awoke within him\r\nwith frightful and wellnigh intolerable pangs. His limbs seemed to have\r\nfallen asleep; he was only conscious of the existence of his stomach,\r\nhorribly cramped and twisted as by a red-hot iron. The fresh odour of\r\nthe vegetables, amongst which he was lying, affected him so keenly that\r\nhe almost fainted away. He strained himself against that piled-up mass\r\nof food with all his remaining strength, in order to compress his\r\nstomach and silence its groans. And the nine other waggons behind him,\r\nwith their mountains of cabbages and peas, their piles of artichokes,\r\nlettuces, celery, and leeks, seemed to him to be slowly overtaking him,\r\nas though to bury him whilst he was thus tortured by hunger beneath an\r\navalanche of food. Presently the procession halted, and there was a\r\nsound of deep voices. They had reached the barriers, and the municipal\r\ncustoms officers were examining the waggons. A moment later Florent\r\nentered Paris, in a swoon, lying atop of the carrots, with clenched\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n\u201CHallow! You up there!\u201D Madame Francois called out sharply.\r\n\r\nAnd as the stranger made no attempt to move, she clambered up and shook\r\nhim. Florent rose to a sitting posture. He had slept and no longer felt\r\nthe pangs of hunger, but was dizzy and confused.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll help me to unload, won\u2019t you?\u201D Madame Francois said to him, as\r\nshe made him get down.\r\n\r\nHe helped her. A stout man with a felt hat on his head and a badge in\r\nthe top buttonhole of his coat was striking the ground with a stick and\r\ngrumbling loudly:\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, come, now, make haste! You must get on faster than that! Bring\r\nthe waggon a little more forward. How many yards\u2019 standing have you?\r\nFour, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he gave a ticket to Madame Francois, who took some coppers out of\r\na little canvas bag and handed them to him; whereupon he went off to\r\nvent his impatience and tap the ground with his stick a little further\r\naway. Madame Francois took hold of Balthazar\u2019s bridle and backed him so\r\nas to bring the wheels of the waggon close to the footway. Then, having\r\nmarked out her four yards with some wisps of straw, after removing the\r\nback of the cart, she asked Florent to hand her the vegetables bunch by\r\nbunch. She arranged them sort by sort on her standing, setting them out\r\nartistically, the \u201Ctops\u201D forming a band of greenery around each pile;\r\nand it was with remarkable rapidity that she completed her show, which,\r\nin the gloom of early morning, looked like some piece of symmetrically\r\ncoloured tapestry. When Florent had handed her a huge bunch of parsley,\r\nwhich he had found at the bottom of the cart, she asked him for still\r\nanother service.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt would be very kind of you,\u201D said she, \u201Cif you would look after my\r\ngoods while I put the horse and cart up. I\u2019m only going a couple of\r\nyards, to the Golden Compasses, in the Rue Montorgueil.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent told her that she might make herself easy. He preferred to\r\nremain still, for his hunger had revived since he had begun to move\r\nabout. He sat down and leaned against a heap of cabbages beside Madame\r\nFrancois\u2019s stock. He was all right there, he told himself, and would\r\nnot go further afield, but wait. His head felt empty, and he had no\r\nvery clear notion as to where he was. At the beginning of September it\r\nis quite dark in the early morning. Around him lighted lanterns were\r\nflitting or standing stationary in the depths of the gloom. He was\r\nsitting on one side of a broad street which he did not recognise; it\r\nstretched far away into the blackness of the night. He could make out\r\nnothing plainly, excepting the stock of which he had been left in\r\ncharge. All around him along the market footways rose similar piles of\r\ngoods. The middle of the roadway was blocked by huge grey tumbrels, and\r\nfrom one end of the street to the other a sound of heavy breathing\r\npassed, betokening the presence of horses which the eye could not\r\ndistinguish.\r\n\r\nShouts and calls, the noise of falling wood, or of iron chains slipping\r\nto the ground, the heavy thud of loads of vegetables discharged from\r\nthe waggons, and the grating of wheels as the carts were backed against\r\nthe footways, filled the yet sonorous awakening, whose near approach\r\ncould be felt and heard in the throbbing gloom. Glancing over the pile\r\nof cabbages behind him. Florent caught sight of a man wrapped like a\r\nparcel in his cloak, and snoring away with his head upon some baskets\r\nof plums. Nearer to him, on his left, he could distinguish a lad, some\r\nten years old, slumbering between two heaps of endive, with an angelic\r\nsmile on his face. And as yet there seemed to be nothing on that\r\npavement that was really awake except the lanterns waving from\r\ninvisible arms, and flitting and skipping over the sleep of the\r\nvegetables and human beings spread out there in heaps pending the dawn.\r\nHowever, what surprised Florent was the sight of some huge pavilions on\r\neither side of the street, pavilions with lofty roofs that seemed to\r\nexpand and soar out of sight amidst a swarm of gleams. In his weakened\r\nstate of mind he fancied he beheld a series of enormous, symmetrically\r\nbuilt palaces, light and airy as crystal, whose fronts sparkled with\r\ncountless streaks of light filtering through endless Venetian shutters.\r\nGleaming between the slender pillar shafts these narrow golden bars\r\nseemed like ladders of light mounting to the gloomy line of the lower\r\nroofs, and then soaring aloft till they reached the jumble of higher\r\nones, thus describing the open framework of immense square halls, where\r\nin the yellow flare of the gas lights a multitude of vague, grey,\r\nslumbering things was gathered together.\r\n\r\nAt last Florent turned his head to look about him, distressed at not\r\nknowing where he was, and filled with vague uneasiness by the sight of\r\nthat huge and seemingly fragile vision. And now, as he raised his eyes,\r\nhe caught sight of the luminous dial and the grey massive pile of Saint\r\nEustache\u2019s Church. At this he was much astonished. He was close to\r\nSaint Eustache, yet all was novel to him.\r\n\r\nHowever, Madame Francois had come back again, and was engaged in a\r\nheated discussion with a man who carried a sack over his shoulder and\r\noffered to buy her carrots for a sou a bunch.\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, now, you are unreasonable, Lacaille!\u201D said she. \u201CYou know\r\nquite well that you will sell them again to the Parisians at four and\r\nfive sous the bunch. Don\u2019t tell me that you won\u2019t! You may have them\r\nfor two sous the bunch, if you like.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as the man went off, she continued: \u201CUpon my word, I believe some\r\npeople think that things grow of their own accord! Let him go and find\r\ncarrots at a sou the bunch elsewhere, tipsy scoundrel that he is! He\u2019ll\r\ncome back again presently, you\u2019ll see.\u201D\r\n\r\nThese last remarks were addressed to Florent. And, seating herself by\r\nhis side, Madame Francois resumed: \u201CIf you\u2019ve been a long time away\r\nfrom Paris, you perhaps don\u2019t know the new markets. They haven\u2019t been\r\nbuilt for more than five years at the most. That pavilion you see there\r\nbeside us is the flower and fruit market. The fish and poultry markets\r\nare farther away, and over there behind us come the vegetables and the\r\nbutter and cheese. There are six pavilions on this side, and on the\r\nother side, across the road, there are four more, with the meat and the\r\ntripe stalls. It\u2019s an enormous place, but it\u2019s horribly cold in the\r\nwinter. They talk about pulling down the houses near the corn market to\r\nmake room for two more pavilions. But perhaps you know all this?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, indeed,\u201D replied Florent; \u201CI\u2019ve been abroad. And what\u2019s the name\r\nof that big street in front of us?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, that\u2019s a new street. It\u2019s called the Rue du Pont Neuf. It leads\r\nfrom the Seine through here to the Rue Montmartre and the Rue\r\nMontorgueil. You would soon have recognized where you were if it had\r\nbeen daylight.\u201D\r\n\r\nMadame Francois paused and rose, for she saw a woman heading down to\r\nexamine her turnips. \u201CAh, is that you, Mother Chantemesse?\u201D she said in\r\na friendly way.\r\n\r\nFlorent meanwhile glanced towards the Rue Montorgueil. It was there\r\nthat a body of police officers had arrested him on the night of\r\nDecember 4.[*] He had been walking along the Boulevard Montmartre at\r\nabout two o\u2019clock, quietly making his way through the crowd, and\r\nsmiling at the number of soldiers that the Elysee had sent into the\r\nstreets to awe the people, when the military suddenly began making a\r\nclean sweep of the thoroughfare, shooting folks down at close range\r\nduring a quarter of an hour. Jostled and knocked to the ground, Florent\r\nfell at the corner of the Rue Vivienne and knew nothing further of what\r\nhappened, for the panic-stricken crowd, in their wild terror of being\r\nshot, trampled over his body. Presently, hearing everything quiet, he\r\nmade an attempt to rise; but across him there lay a young woman in a\r\npink bonnet, whose shawl had slipped aside, allowing her chemisette,\r\npleated in little tucks, to be seen. Two bullets had pierced the upper\r\npart of her bosom; and when Florent gently removed the poor creature to\r\nfree his legs, two streamlets of blood oozed from her wounds on to his\r\nhands. Then he sprang up with a sudden bound, and rushed madly away,\r\nhatless and with his hands still wet with blood. Until evening he\r\nwandered about the streets, with his head swimming, ever seeing the\r\nyoung woman lying across his legs with her pale face, her blue staring\r\neyes, her distorted lips, and her expression of astonishment at thus\r\nmeeting death so suddenly. He was a shy, timid fellow. Albeit thirty\r\nyears old he had never dared to stare women in the face; and now, for\r\nthe rest of his life, he was to have that one fixed in his heart and\r\nmemory. He felt as though he had lost some loved one of his own.\r\n\r\n[*] 1851. Two days after the Coup d\u2019Etat.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening, without knowing how he had got there, still dazed and\r\nhorrified as he was by the terrible scenes of the afternoon, he had\r\nfound himself at a wine shop in the Rue Montorgueil, where several men\r\nwere drinking and talking of throwing up barricades. He went away with\r\nthem, helped them to tear up a few paving-stones, and seated himself on\r\nthe barricade, weary with his long wandering through the streets, and\r\nreflecting that he would fight when the soldiers came up. However, he\r\nhad not even a knife with him, and was still bareheaded. Towards eleven\r\no\u2019clock he dozed off, and in his sleep could see the two holes in the\r\ndead woman\u2019s white chemisette glaring at him like eyes reddened by\r\ntears and blood. When he awoke he found himself in the grasp of four\r\npolice officers, who were pummelling him with their fists. The men who\r\nhad built the barricade had fled. The police officers treated him with\r\nstill greater violence, and indeed almost strangled him when they\r\nnoticed that his hands were stained with blood. It was the blood of the\r\nyoung woman.\r\n\r\nFlorent raised his eyes to the luminous dial of Saint Eustache with his\r\nmind so full of these recollections that he did not notice the position\r\nof the pointers. It was, however, nearly four o\u2019clock. The markets were\r\nas yet wrapped in sleep. Madame Francois was still talking to old\r\nMadame Chantemesse, both standing and arguing about the price of\r\nturnips, and Florent now called to mind how narrowly he had escaped\r\nbeing shot over yonder by the wall of Saint Eustache. A detachment of\r\ngendarmes had just blown out the brains of five unhappy fellows caught\r\nat a barricade in the Rue Greneta. The five corpses were lying on the\r\nfootway, at a spot where he thought he could now distinguish a heap of\r\nrosy radishes. He himself had escaped being shot merely because the\r\npolicemen only carried swords. They took him to a neighbouring police\r\nstation and gave the officer in charge a scrap of paper, on which were\r\nthese words written in pencil: \u201CTaken with blood-stained hands. Very\r\ndangerous.\u201D Then he had been dragged from station to station till the\r\nmorning came. The scrap of paper accompanied him wherever he went. He\r\nwas manacled and guarded as though he were a raving madman. At the\r\nstation in the Rue de la Lingerie some tipsy soldiers wanted to shoot\r\nhim; and they had already lighted a lantern with that object when the\r\norder arrived for the prisoners to be taken to the depot of the\r\nPrefecture of Police. Two days afterwards he found himself in a\r\ncasemate of the fort of Bic\u00EAtre. Ever since then he had been suffering\r\nfrom hunger. He had felt hungry in the casemate, and the pangs of\r\nhunger had never since left him. A hundred men were pent in the depths\r\nof that cellar-like dungeon, where, scarce able to breathe, they\r\ndevoured the few mouthfuls of bread that were thrown to them, like so\r\nmany captive wild beasts.\r\n\r\nWhen Florent was brought before an investigating magistrate, without\r\nanyone to defend him, and without any evidence being adduced, he was\r\naccused of belonging to a secret society; and when he swore that this\r\nwas untrue, the magistrate produced the scrap of paper from amongst the\r\ndocuments before him: \u201CTaken with blood-stained hands. Very dangerous.\u201D\r\nThat was quite sufficient. He was condemned to transportation. Six\r\nweeks afterwards, one January night, a gaoler awoke him and locked him\r\nup in a courtyard with more than four hundred other prisoners. An hour\r\nlater this first detachment started for the pontoons and exile,\r\nhandcuffed and guarded by a double file of gendarmes with loaded\r\nmuskets. They crossed the Austerlitz bridge, followed the line of the\r\nboulevards, and so reached the terminus of the Western Railway line. It\r\nwas a joyous carnival night. The windows of the restaurants on the\r\nboulevards glittered with lights. At the top of the Rue Vivienne, just\r\nat the spot where he ever saw the young woman lying dead\u2014that unknown\r\nyoung woman whose image he always bore with him\u2014he now beheld a large\r\ncarriage in which a party of masked women, with bare shoulders and\r\nlaughing voices, were venting their impatience at being detained, and\r\nexpressing their horror of that endless procession of convicts. The\r\nwhole of the way from Paris to Havre the prisoners never received a\r\nmouthful of bread or a drink of water. The officials had forgotten to\r\ngive them their rations before starting, and it was not till thirty-six\r\nhours afterwards, when they had been stowed away in the hold of the\r\nfrigate _Canada_, that they at last broke their fast.\r\n\r\nNo, Florent had never again been free from hunger. He recalled all the\r\npast to mind, but could not recollect a single hour of satiety. He had\r\nbecome dry and withered; his stomach seemed to have shrunk; his skin\r\nclung to his bones. And now that he was back in Paris once more, he\r\nfound it fat and sleek and flourishing, teeming with food in the midst\r\nof the darkness. He had returned to it on a couch of vegetables; he\r\nlingered in its midst encompassed by unknown masses of food which still\r\nand ever increased and disquieted him. Had that happy carnival night\r\ncontinued throughout those seven years, then? Once again he saw the\r\nglittering windows on the boulevards, the laughing women, the\r\nluxurious, greedy city which he had quitted on that far-away January\r\nnight; and it seemed to him that everything had expanded and increased\r\nin harmony with those huge markets, whose gigantic breathing, still\r\nheavy from the indigestion of the previous day, he now began to hear.\r\n\r\nOld Mother Chantemesse had by this time made up her mind to buy a dozen\r\nbunches of turnips. She put them in her apron, which she held closely\r\npressed to her person, thus making herself look yet more corpulent than\r\nshe was; and for some time longer she lingered there, still gossiping\r\nin a drawling voice. When at last she went away, Madame Francois again\r\nsat down by the side of Florent.\r\n\r\n\u201CPoor old Mother Chantemesse!\u201D she said; \u201Cshe must be at least\r\nseventy-two. I can remember her buying turnips of my father when I was\r\na mere chit. And she hasn\u2019t a relation in the world; no one but a young\r\nhussy whom she picked up I don\u2019t know where and who does nothing but\r\nbring her trouble. Still, she manages to live, selling things by the\r\nha\u2019p\u2019orth and clearing her couple of francs profit a day. For my own\r\npart, I\u2019m sure that I could never spend my days on the foot-pavement in\r\nthis horrid Paris! And she hasn\u2019t even any relations here!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou have some relations in Paris, I suppose?\u201D she asked presently,\r\nseeing that Florent seemed disinclined to talk.\r\n\r\nFlorent did not appear to hear her. A feeling of distrust came back to\r\nhim. His head was teeming with old stories of the police, stories of\r\nspies prowling about at every street corner, and of women selling the\r\nsecrets which they managed to worm out of the unhappy fellows they\r\ndeluded. Madame Francois was sitting close beside him and certainly\r\nlooked perfectly straightforward and honest, with her big calm face,\r\nabove which was bound a black and yellow handkerchief. She seemed about\r\nfive and thirty years of age, and was somewhat stoutly built, with a\r\ncertain hardy beauty due to her life in the fresh air. A pair of black\r\neyes, which beamed with kindly tenderness, softened the more masculine\r\ncharacteristics of her person. She certainly was inquisitive, but her\r\ncuriosity was probably well meant.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve a nephew in Paris,\u201D she continued, without seeming at all\r\noffended by Florent\u2019s silence. \u201CHe\u2019s turned out badly though, and has\r\nenlisted. It\u2019s a pleasant thing to have somewhere to go to and stay at,\r\nisn\u2019t it? I dare say there\u2019s a big surprise in store for your relations\r\nwhen they see you. But it\u2019s always a pleasure to welcome one of one\u2019s\r\nown people back again, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe kept her eyes fixed upon him while she spoke, doubtless\r\ncompassionating his extreme scragginess; fancying, too, that there was\r\na \u201Cgentleman\u201D inside those old black rags, and so not daring to slip a\r\npiece of silver into his hand. At last, however, she timidly murmured:\r\n\u201CAll the same, if you should happen just at present to be in want of\r\nanything\u2014\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Florent checked her with uneasy pride. He told her that he had\r\neverything he required, and had a place to go to. She seemed quite\r\npleased to hear this, and, as though to tranquillise herself concerning\r\nhim, repeated several times: \u201CWell, well, in that case you\u2019ve only got\r\nto wait till daylight.\u201D\r\n\r\nA large bell at the corner of the fruit market, just over Florent\u2019s\r\nhead, now began to ring. The slow regular peals seemed to gradually\r\ndissipate the slumber that yet lingered all around. Carts were still\r\narriving, and the shouts of the waggoners, the cracking of their whips,\r\nand the grinding of the paving-stones beneath the iron-bound wheels and\r\nthe horses\u2019 shoes sounded with an increasing din. The carts could now\r\nonly advance by a series of spasmodic jolts, and stretched in a long\r\nline, one behind the other, till they were lost to sight in the distant\r\ndarkness, whence a confused roar ascended.\r\n\r\nUnloading was in progress all along the Rue du Pont Neuf, the vehicles\r\nbeing drawn up close to the edge of the footways, while their teams\r\nstood motionless in close order as at a horse fair. Florent felt\r\ninterested in one enormous tumbrel which was piled up with magnificent\r\ncabbages, and had only been backed to the kerb with the greatest\r\ndifficulty. Its load towered above the lofty gas lamp whose bright\r\nlight fell full upon the broad leaves which looked like pieces of dark\r\ngreen velvet, scalloped and goffered. A young peasant girl, some\r\nsixteen years old, in a blue linen jacket and cap, had climbed on to\r\nthe tumbrel, where, buried in the cabbages to her shoulders, she took\r\nthem one by one and threw them to somebody concealed in the shade\r\nbelow. Every now and then the girl would slip and vanish, overwhelmed\r\nby an avalanche of the vegetables, but her rosy nose soon reappeared\r\namidst the teeming greenery, and she broke into a laugh while the\r\ncabbages again flew down between Florent and the gas lamp. He counted\r\nthem mechanically as they fell. When the cart was emptied he felt\r\nworried.\r\n\r\nThe piles of vegetables on the pavement now extended to the verge of\r\nthe roadway. Between the heaps, the market gardeners left narrow paths\r\nto enable people to pass along. The whole of the wide footway was\r\ncovered from end to end with dark mounds. As yet, in the sudden dancing\r\ngleams of light from the lanterns, you only just espied the luxuriant\r\nfulness of the bundles of artichokes, the delicate green of the\r\nlettuces, the rosy coral of the carrots, and dull ivory of the turnips.\r\nAnd these gleams of rich colour flitted along the heaps, according as\r\nthe lanterns came and went. The footway was now becoming populated: a\r\ncrowd of people had awakened, and was moving hither and thither amidst\r\nthe vegetables, stopping at times, and chattering and shouting. In the\r\ndistance a loud voice could be heard crying, \u201CEndive! who\u2019s got\r\nendive?\u201D The gates of the pavilion devoted to the sale of ordinary\r\nvegetables had just been opened; and the retail dealers who had stalls\r\nthere, with white caps on their heads, fichus knotted over their black\r\njackets, and skirts pinned up to keep them from getting soiled, now\r\nbegan to secure their stock for the day, depositing their purchases in\r\nsome huge porters\u2019 baskets placed upon the ground. Between the roadway\r\nand the pavilion these baskets were to be seen coming and going on all\r\nsides, knocking against the crowded heads of the bystanders, who\r\nresented the pushing with coarse expressions, whilst all around was a\r\nclamour of voices growing hoarse by prolonged wrangling over a sou or\r\ntwo. Florent was astonished by the calmness of the female market\r\ngardeners, with bandanas and bronzed faces, displayed amidst all this\r\ngarrulous bargaining of the markets.\r\n\r\nBehind him, on the footway of the Rue Rambuteau, fruit was being sold.\r\nHampers and low baskets covered with canvas or straw stood there in\r\nlong lines, a strong odour of over-ripe mirabelle plums was wafted\r\nhither and thither. At last a subdued and gentle voice, which he had\r\nheard for some time past, induced him to turn his head, and he saw a\r\ncharming darksome little woman sitting on the ground and bargaining.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome now, Marcel,\u201D said she, \u201Cyou\u2019ll take a hundred sous, won\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe man to whom she was speaking was closely wrapped in his cloak and\r\nmade no reply; however, after a silence of five minutes or more, the\r\nyoung woman returned to the charge.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome now, Marcel; a hundred sous for that basket there, and four\r\nfrancs for the other one; that\u2019ll make nine francs altogether.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen came another interval.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, tell me what you will take.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTen francs. You know that well enough already; I told you so before.\r\nBut what have you done with your Jules this morning, La Sarriette?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe young woman began to laugh as she took a handful of small change\r\nout of her pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201COh,\u201D she replied, \u201CJules is still in bed. He says that men were not\r\nintended to work.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe paid for the two baskets, and carried them into the fruit pavilion,\r\nwhich had just been opened. The market buildings still retained their\r\ngloom-wrapped aspect of airy fragility, streaked with the thousand\r\nlines of light that gleamed from the venetian shutters. People were\r\nbeginning to pass along the broad covered streets intersecting the\r\npavilions, but the more distant buildings still remained deserted\r\namidst the increasing buzz of life on the footways. By Saint Eustache\r\nthe bakers and wine sellers were taking down their shutters, and the\r\nruddy shops, with their gas lights flaring, showed like gaps of fire in\r\nthe gloom in which the grey house-fronts were yet steeped. Florent\r\nnoticed a baker\u2019s shop on the left-hand side of the Rue Montorgueil,\r\nreplete and golden with its last baking, and fancied he could scent the\r\npleasant smell of the hot bread. It was now half past four.\r\n\r\nMadame Francois by this time had disposed of nearly all her stock. She\r\nhad only a few bunches of carrots left when Lacaille once more made his\r\nappearance with his sack.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D said he, \u201Cwill you take a sou now?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI knew I should see you again,\u201D the good woman quietly answered.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019d better take all I have left. There are seventeen bunches.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat makes seventeen sous.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; thirty-four.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt last they agreed to fix the price at twenty-five sous. Madame\r\nFrancois was anxious to be off.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019d been keeping his eye upon me all the time,\u201D she said to Florent,\r\nwhen Lacaille had gone off with the carrots in his sack. \u201CThat old\r\nrogue runs things down all over the markets, and he often waits till\r\nthe last peal of the bell before spending four sous in purchase. Oh,\r\nthese Paris folk! They\u2019ll wrangle and argue for an hour to save half a\r\nsou, and then go off and empty their purses at the wine shop.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhenever Madame Francois talked of Paris she always spoke in a tone of\r\ndisdain, and referred to the city as though it were some ridiculous,\r\ncontemptible, far-away place, in which she only condescended to set\r\nfoot at nighttime.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere!\u201D she continued, sitting down again, beside Florent, on some\r\nvegetables belonging to a neighbour, \u201CI can get away now.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent bent his head. He had just committed a theft. When Lacaille\r\nwent off he had caught sight of a carrot lying on the ground, and\r\nhaving picked it up he was holding it tightly in his right hand. Behind\r\nhim were some bundles of celery and bunches of parsley were diffusing\r\npungent odours which painfully affected him.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I\u2019m off now!\u201D said Madame Francois.\r\n\r\nHowever, she felt interested in this stranger, and could divine that he\r\nwas suffering there on that foot-pavement, from which he had never\r\nstirred. She made him fresh offers of assistance, but he again refused\r\nthem, with a still more bitter show of pride. He even got up and\r\nremained standing to prove that he was quite strong again. Then, as\r\nMadame Francois turned her head away, he put the carrot to his mouth.\r\nBut he had to remove it for a moment, in spite of the terrible longing\r\nwhich he felt to dig his teeth into it; for Madame Francois turned\r\nround again and looking him full in the face, began to question him\r\nwith her good-natured womanly curiosity. Florent, to avoid speaking,\r\nmerely answered by nods and shakes of the head. Then, slowly and\r\ngently, he began to eat the carrot.\r\n\r\nThe worthy woman was at last on the point of going off, when a powerful\r\nvoice exclaimed close beside her, \u201CGood morning, Madame Francois.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a slim young man, with big bones and a big head. His\r\nface was bearded, and he had a very delicate nose and narrow sparkling\r\neyes. He wore on his head a rusty, battered, black felt hat, and was\r\nbuttoned up in an immense overcoat, which had once been of a soft\r\nchestnut hue, but which rain had discoloured and streaked with long\r\ngreenish stains. Somewhat bent, and quivering with a nervous\r\nrestlessness which was doubtless habitual with him, he stood there in a\r\npair of heavy laced shoes, and the shortness of his trousers allowed a\r\nglimpse of his coarse blue hose.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood morning, Monsieur Claude,\u201D the market gardener replied\r\ncheerfully. \u201CI expected you, you know, last Monday, and, as you didn\u2019t\r\ncome, I\u2019ve taken care of your canvas for you. I\u2019ve hung it up on a nail\r\nin my room.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are really very kind, Madame Francois. I\u2019ll go to finish that\r\nstudy of mine one of these days. I wasn\u2019t able to go on Monday. Has\r\nyour big plum tree still got all its leaves?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, indeed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wanted to know, because I mean to put it in a corner of the picture.\r\nIt will come in nicely by the side of the fowl house. I have been\r\nthinking about it all the week. What lovely vegetables are in the\r\nmarket this morning! I came down very early, expecting a fine sunrise\r\neffect upon all these heaps of cabbages.\u201D\r\n\r\nWith a wave of the arm he indicated the footway.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, well, I must be off now,\u201D said Madame Francois. \u201CGood-bye for\r\nthe present. We shall meet again soon, I hope, Monsieur Claude.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, as she turned to go, she introduced Florent to the young\r\nartist.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis gentleman, it seems, has just come from a distance,\u201D said she.\r\n\u201CHe feels quite lost in your scampish Paris. I dare say you might be of\r\nservice to him.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she at last took her departure, feeling pleased at having left the\r\ntwo men together. Claude looked at Florent with a feeling of interest.\r\nThat tall, slight, wavy figure seemed to him original. Madame\r\nFrancois\u2019s hasty presentation was in his eyes quite sufficient, and he\r\naddressed Florent with the easy familiarity of a lounger accustomed to\r\nall sorts of chance encounters.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll accompany you,\u201D he said; \u201Cwhich way are you going?\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent felt ill at ease; he was not wont to unbosom himself so\r\nreadily. However, ever since his arrival in Paris, a question had been\r\ntrembling on his lips, and now he ventured to ask it, with the evident\r\nfear of receiving an unfavourable reply.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs the Rue Pirouette still in existence?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes,\u201D answered the artist. \u201CA very curious corner of old Paris is\r\nthe Rue Pirouette. It twists and turns like a dancing girl, and the\r\nhouses bulge out like pot-bellied gluttons. I\u2019ve made an etching of it\r\nthat isn\u2019t half bad. I\u2019ll show it to you when you come to see me. Is it\r\nto the Rue Pirouette that you want to go?\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent, who felt easier and more cheerful now that he knew the street\r\nstill existed, declared that he did not want to go there; in fact, he\r\ndid not want to go anywhere in particular. All his distrust awoke into\r\nfresh life at Claude\u2019s insistence.\r\n\r\n\u201COh! never mind,\u201D said the artist, \u201Clet\u2019s go to the Rue Pirouette all\r\nthe same. It has such a fine colour at night time. Come along; it\u2019s\r\nonly a couple of yards away.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent felt constrained to follow him, and the two men walked off,\r\nside by side, stepping over the hampers and vegetables like a couple of\r\nold friends. On the footway of the Rue Rambuteau there were some\r\nimmense heaps of cauliflowers, symmetrically piled up like so many\r\ncannonballs. The soft-white flowers spread out like huge roses in the\r\nmidst of their thick green leaves, and the piles had something of the\r\nappearance of bridal bouquets ranged in a row in colossal flower\r\nstands. Claude stopped in front of them, venting cries of admiration.\r\n\r\nThen, on turning into the Rue Pirouette, which was just opposite, he\r\npointed out each house to his companion, and explained his views\r\nconcerning it. There was only a single gas lamp, burning in a corner.\r\nThe buildings, which had settled down and swollen, threw their\r\npent-houses forward in such wise as to justify Claude\u2019s allusion to\r\npot-bellied gluttons, whilst their gables receded, and on either side\r\nthey clung to their neighbours for support. Three or four, however,\r\nstanding in gloomy recesses, appeared to be on the point of toppling\r\nforward. The solitary gas lamp illumined one which was snowy with a\r\nfresh coat of whitewash, suggesting some flabby broken-down old\r\ndowager, powdered and bedaubed in the hope of appearing young. Then the\r\nothers stretched away into the darkness, bruised, dented, and cracked,\r\ngreeny with the fall of water from their roofs, and displaying such an\r\nextraordinary variety of attitudes and tints that Claude could not\r\nrefrain from laughing as he contemplated them.\r\n\r\nFlorent, however, came to stand at the corner of the rue de Mondetour,\r\nin front of the last house but one on the left. Here the three floors,\r\neach with two shutterless windows, having little white curtains closely\r\ndrawn, seemed wrapped in sleep; but, up above, a light could be seen\r\nflitting behind the curtains of a tiny gable casement. However, the\r\nsight of the shop beneath the pent-house seemed to fill Florent with\r\nthe deepest emotion. It was kept by a dealer in cooked vegetables, and\r\nwas just being opened. At its far end some metal pans were glittering,\r\nwhile on several earthen ones in the window there was a display of\r\ncooked spinach and endive, reduced to a paste and arranged in conical\r\nmounds from which customers were served with shovel-like carvers of\r\nwhite metal, only the handles of which were visible. This sight seemed\r\nto rivet Florent to the ground with surprise. He evidently could not\r\nrecognize the place. He read the name of the shopkeeper, Godeboeuf,\r\nwhich was painted on a red sign board up above, and remained quite\r\novercome by consternation. His arms dangling beside him, he began to\r\nexamine the cooked spinach, with the despairing air of one on whom some\r\nsupreme misfortune falls.\r\n\r\nHowever, the gable casement was now opened, and a little old woman\r\nleaned out of it, and looked first at the sky and then at the markets\r\nin the distance.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, Mademoiselle Saget is an early riser,\u201D exclaimed Claude, who had\r\njust raised his head. And, turning to his companion, he added: \u201CI once\r\nhad an aunt living in that house. It\u2019s a regular hive of tittle-tattle!\r\nAh, the Mehudins are stirring now, I see. There\u2019s a light on the second\r\nfloor.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent would have liked to question his companion, but the latter\u2019s\r\nlong discoloured overcoat give him a disquieting appearance. So without\r\na word Florent followed him, whilst he went on talking about the\r\nMehudins. These Mehudins were fish-girls, it seemed; the older one was\r\na magnificent creature, while the younger one, who sold fresh-water\r\nfish, reminded Claude of one of Murillo\u2019s virgins, whenever he saw her\r\nstanding with her fair face amidst her carps and eels.\r\n\r\nFrom this Claude went on to remark with asperity that Murillo painted\r\nlike an ignoramus. But all at once he stopped short in the middle of\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome!\u201D he exclaimed, \u201Ctell me where it is that you want to go.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t want to go anywhere just at present,\u201D replied Florent in\r\nconfusion. \u201CLet\u2019s go wherever you like.\u201D\r\n\r\nJust as they were leaving the Rue Pirouette, some one called to Claude\r\nfrom a wine shop at the corner of the street. The young man went in,\r\ndragging Florent with him. The shutters had been taken down on one side\r\nonly, and the gas was still burning in the sleepy atmosphere of the\r\nshop. A forgotten napkin and some cards that had been used in the\r\nprevious evening\u2019s play were still lying on the tables; and the fresh\r\nbreeze that streamed in through the open doorway freshened the close,\r\nwarm vinous air. The landlord, Monsieur Lebigre, was serving his\r\ncustomers. He wore a sleeved waistcoat, and his fat regular features,\r\nfringed by an untidy beard, were still pale with sleep. Standing in\r\nfront of the counter, groups of men, with heavy, tired eyes, were\r\ndrinking, coughing, and spitting, whilst trying to rouse themselves by\r\nthe aid of white wine and brandy. Amongst them Florent recognised\r\nLacaille, whose sack now overflowed with various sorts of vegetables.\r\nHe was taking his third dram with a friend, who was telling him a long\r\nstory about the purchase of a hamper of potatoes.[*] When he had\r\nemptied his glass, he went to chat with Monsieur Lebigre in a little\r\nglazed compartment at the end of the room, where the gas had not yet\r\nbeen lighted.\r\n\r\n[*] At the Paris central markets potatoes are sold by the hamper, not\r\nby the sack as in England.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat will you take?\u201D Claude asked of Florent.\r\n\r\nHe had on entering grasped the hand of the person who had called out to\r\nhim. This was a market porter,[*] a well-built young man of two and\r\ntwenty at the most. His cheeks and chin were clean-shaven, but he wore\r\na small moustache, and looked a sprightly, strapping fellow with his\r\nbroad-brimmed hat covered with chalk, and his wool-worked neck-piece,\r\nthe straps falling from which tightened his short blue blouse. Claude,\r\nwho called him Alexandre, patted his arms, and asked him when they were\r\ngoing to Charentonneau again. Then they talked about a grand excursion\r\nthey had made together in a boat on the Marne, when they had eaten a\r\nrabbit for supper in the evening.\r\n\r\n[*] _Fort_ is the French term, literally \u201Ca strong man,\u201D as every\r\nmarket porter needs to be.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, what will you take?\u201D Claude again asked Florent.\r\n\r\nThe latter looked at the counter in great embarrassment. At one end of\r\nit some stoneware pots, encircled with brass bands and containing punch\r\nand hot wine, were standing over the short blue flames of a gas stove.\r\nFlorent at last confessed that a glass of something warm would be\r\nwelcome. Monsieur Lebigre thereupon served them with three glasses of\r\npunch. In a basket near the pots were some smoking hot rolls which had\r\nonly just arrived. However, as neither of the others took one, Florent\r\nlikewise refrained, and drank his punch. He felt it slipping down into\r\nhis empty stomach, like a steam of molten lead. It was Alexandre who\r\npaid for the \u201Cshout.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s a fine fellow, that Alexandre!\u201D said Claude, when he and Florent\r\nfound themselves alone again on the footway of the Rue Rambuteau. \u201CHe\u2019s\r\na very amusing companion to take into the country. He\u2019s fond of showing\r\nhis strength. And then he\u2019s so magnificently built! I have seen him\r\nstripped. Ah, if I could only get him to pose for me in the nude out in\r\nthe open air! Well, we\u2019ll go and take a turn through the markets now,\r\nif you like.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent followed, yielding entirely to his new friend\u2019s guidance. A\r\nbright glow at the far end of the Rue Rambuteau announced the break of\r\nday. The far-spreading voice of the markets was become more sonorous,\r\nand every now and then the peals of a bell ringing in some distant\r\npavilion mingled with the swelling, rising clamour. Claude and Florent\r\nentered one of the covered streets between the fish and poultry\r\npavilions. Florent raised his eyes and looked at the lofty vault\r\noverhead, the inner timbers of which glistened amidst a black lacework\r\nof iron supports. As he turned into the great central thoroughfare he\r\npictured himself in some strange town, with its various districts and\r\nsuburbs, promenades and streets, squares and cross-roads, all suddenly\r\nplaced under shelter on a rainy day by the whim of some gigantic power.\r\nThe deep gloom brooding in the hollows of the roofs multiplied, as it\r\nwere, the forest of pillars, and infinitely increased the number of the\r\ndelicate ribs, railed galleries, and transparent shutters. And over the\r\nphantom city and far away into the depths of the shade, a teeming,\r\nflowering vegetation of luxuriant metal-work, with spindle-shaped stems\r\nand twining knotted branches, covered the vast expanse as with the\r\nfoliage of some ancient forest. Several departments of the markets\r\nstill slumbered behind their closed iron gates. The butter and poultry\r\npavilions displayed rows of little trellised stalls and long alleys,\r\nwhich lines of gas lights showed to be deserted. The fish market,\r\nhowever, had just been opened, and women were flitting to and fro\r\namongst the white slabs littered with shadowy hampers and cloths. Among\r\nthe vegetables and fruit and flowers the noise and bustle were\r\ngradually increasing. The whole place was by degree waking up, from the\r\npopular quarter where the cabbages are piled at four o\u2019clock in the\r\nmorning, to the lazy and wealthy district which only hangs up its\r\npullets and pheasants when the hands of the clock point to eight.\r\n\r\nThe great covered alleys were now teeming with life. All along the\r\nfootways on both sides of the road there were still many market\r\ngardeners, with other small growers from the environs of Paris, who\r\ndisplayed baskets containing their \u201Cgatherings\u201D of the previous\r\nevening\u2014bundles of vegetables and clusters of fruit. Whilst the crowd\r\nincessantly paced hither and thither, vehicles barred the road; and\r\nFlorent, in order to pass them, had to press against some dingy sacks,\r\nlike coal-sacks in appearance, and so numerous and heavy that the\r\naxle-trees of the vans bent beneath them. They were quite damp, and\r\nexhaled a fresh odour of seaweed. From a rent low down in the side of\r\none of them a black stream of big mussels was trickling.\r\n\r\nFlorent and Claude had now to pause at every step. The fish was\r\narriving and one after another the drays of the railway companies drove\r\nup laden with wooden cages full of the hampers and baskets that had\r\ncome by train from the sea coast. And to get out of the way of the fish\r\ndrays, which became more and more numerous and disquieting, the artist\r\nand Florent rushed amongst the wheels of the drays laden with butter\r\nand eggs and cheese, huge yellow vehicles bearing coloured lanterns,\r\nand drawn by four horses. The market porters carried the cases of eggs,\r\nand baskets of cheese and butter, into the auction pavilion, where\r\nclerks were making entries in note books by the light of the gas.\r\n\r\nClaude was quite charmed with all this uproar, and forgot everything to\r\ngaze at some effect of light, some group of blouses, or the picturesque\r\nunloading of a cart. At last they extricated themselves from the crowd,\r\nand as they continued on their way along the main artery they presently\r\nfound themselves amidst an exquisite perfume which seemed to be\r\nfollowing them. They were in the cut-flower market. All over the\r\nfootways, to the right and left, women were seated in front of large\r\nrectangular baskets full of bunches of roses, violets, dahlias, and\r\nmarguerites. At times the clumps darkened and looked like splotches of\r\nblood, at others they brightened into silvery greys of the softest\r\ntones. A lighted candle, standing near one basket, set amidst the\r\ngeneral blackness quite a melody of colour\u2014the bright variegations of\r\nmarguerites, the blood-red crimson of dahlias, the bluey purple of\r\nviolets, and the warm flesh tints of roses. And nothing could have been\r\nsweeter or more suggestive of springtide than this soft breath of\r\nperfume encountered on the footway, on emerging from the sharp odours\r\nof the fish market and the pestilential smell of the butter and the\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nClaude and Florent turned round and strolled about, loitering among the\r\nflowers. They halted with some curiosity before several women who were\r\nselling bunches of fern and bundles of vine-leaves, neatly tied up in\r\npackets of five and twenty. Then they turned down another covered\r\nalley, which was almost deserted, and where their footsteps echoed as\r\nthough they had been walking through a church. Here they found a little\r\ncart, scarcely larger than a wheelbarrow, to which was harnessed a\r\ndiminutive donkey, who, no doubt, felt bored, for at sight of them he\r\nbegan braying with such prolonged and sonorous force that the vast\r\nroofing of the markets fairly trembled. Then the horses began to neigh\r\nin reply, there was a sound of pawing and tramping, a distant uproar,\r\nwhich swelled, rolled along, then died away.\r\n\r\nMeantime, in the Rue Berger in front of them, Claude and Florent\r\nperceived a number of bare, frontless, salesmen\u2019s shops, where, by the\r\nlight of flaring gas jets, they could distinguish piles of hampers and\r\nfruit, enclosed by three dirty walls which were covered with addition\r\nsums in pencil. And the two wanderers were still standing there,\r\ncontemplating this scene, when they noticed a well-dressed woman\r\nhuddled up in a cab which looked quite lost and forlorn in the block of\r\ncarts as it stealthily made its way onwards.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s Cinderella coming back without her slippers,\u201D remarked Claude\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\nThey began chatting together as they went back towards the markets.\r\nClaude whistled as he strolled along with his hands in his pockets, and\r\nexpatiated on his love for this mountain of food which rises every\r\nmorning in the very centre of Paris. He prowled about the footways\r\nnight after night, dreaming of colossal still-life subjects, paintings\r\nof an extraordinary character. He had even started on one, having his\r\nfriend Marjolin and that jade Cadine to pose for him; but it was hard\r\nwork to paint those confounded vegetables and fruit and fish and\r\nmeat\u2014they were all so beautiful! Florent listened to the artist\u2019s\r\nenthusiastic talk with a void and hunger-aching stomach. It did not\r\nseem to occur to Claude that all those things were intended to be\r\neaten. Their charm for him lay in their colour. Suddenly, however, he\r\nceased speaking and, with a gesture that was habitual to him, tightened\r\nthe long red sash which he wore under his green-stained coat.\r\n\r\nAnd then with a sly expression he resumed:\r\n\r\n\u201CBesides, I breakfast here, through my eyes, at any rate, and that\u2019s\r\nbetter than getting nothing at all. Sometimes, when I\u2019ve forgotten to\r\ndine on the previous day, I treat myself to a perfect fit of\r\nindigestion in the morning by watching the carts arrive here laden with\r\nall sorts of good things. On such mornings as those I love my\r\nvegetables more than ever. Ah! the exasperating part, the rank\r\ninjustice of it all, is that those rascally Philistines really eat\r\nthese things!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he went on to tell Florent of a supper to which a friend had\r\ntreated him at Baratte\u2019s on a day of affluence. They had partaken of\r\noysters, fish, and game. But Baratte\u2019s had sadly fallen, and all the\r\ncarnival life of the old March\u00E9 des Innocents was now buried. In place\r\nthereof they had those huge central markets, that colossus of ironwork,\r\nthat new and wonderful town. Fools might say what they liked; it was\r\nthe embodiment of the spirit of the times. Florent, however, could not\r\nat first make out whether he was condemning the picturesqueness of\r\nBaratte\u2019s or its good cheer.\r\n\r\nBut Claude next began to inveigh against romanticism. He preferred his\r\npiles of vegetables, he said, to the rags of the middle ages; and he\r\nended by reproaching himself with guilty weakness in making an etching\r\nof the Rue Pirouette. All those grimy old places ought to be levelled\r\nto the ground, he declared, and modern houses ought to be built in\r\ntheir stead.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere!\u201D he exclaimed, coming to a halt, \u201Clook at the corner of the\r\nfootway yonder! Isn\u2019t that a picture readymade, ever so much more human\r\nand natural than all their confounded consumptive daubs?\u201D\r\n\r\nAlong the covered way women were now selling hot soup and coffee. At\r\none corner of the foot-pavement a large circle of customers clustered\r\nround a vendor of cabbage soup. The bright tin caldron, full of broth,\r\nwas steaming over a little low stove, through the holes of which came\r\nthe pale glow of the embers. From a napkin-lined basket the woman took\r\nsome thin slices of bread and dropped them into yellow cups; then with\r\na ladle she filled the cups with liquor. Around her were saleswomen\r\nneatly dressed, market gardeners in blouses, porters with coats soiled\r\nby the loads they had carried, poor ragged vagabonds\u2014in fact, all the\r\nearly hungry ones of the markets, eating, and scalding their mouths,\r\nand drawing back their chins to avoid soiling them with the drippings\r\nfrom their spoons. The delighted artist blinked, and sought a point of\r\nview so as to get a good ensemble of the picture. That cabbage soup,\r\nhowever, exhaled a very strong odour. Florent, for his part, turned his\r\nhead away, distressed by the sight of the full cups which the customers\r\nemptied in silence, glancing around them the while like suspicious\r\nanimals. As the woman began serving a fresh customer, Claude himself\r\nwas affected by the odorous steam of the soup, which was wafted full in\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nHe again tightened his sash, half amused and half annoyed. Then\r\nresuming his walk, and alluding to the punch paid for by Alexandre, he\r\nsaid to Florent in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s very odd, but have you ever noticed that although a man can\r\nalways find somebody to treat him to something to drink, he can never\r\nfind a soul who will stand him anything to eat?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe dawn was now rising. The houses on the Boulevard de Sebastopol at\r\nthe end of the Rue de la Cossonnerie were still black; but above the\r\nsharp line of their slate roofs a patch of pale blue sky, circumscribed\r\nby the arch-pieces of the covered way, showed like a gleaming\r\nhalf-moon. Claude, who had been bending over some grated openings on a\r\nlevel with the ground, through which a glimpse could be obtained of\r\ndeep cellars where gas lights glimmered, now glanced up into the air\r\nbetween the lofty pillars, as though scanning the dark roofs which\r\nfringed the clear sky. Then he halted again, with his eyes fixed on one\r\nof the light iron ladders which connect the superposed market roofs and\r\ngive access from one to the other. Florent asked him what he was\r\nseeking there.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m looking for that scamp of a Marjolin,\u201D replied the artist. \u201CHe\u2019s\r\nsure to be in some guttering up there, unless, indeed, he\u2019s been\r\nspending the night in the poultry cellars. I want him to give me a\r\nsitting.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he went on to relate how a market saleswoman had found his friend\r\nMarjolin one morning in a pile of cabbages, and how Marjolin had grown\r\nup in all liberty on the surrounding footways. When an attempt had been\r\nmade to send him to school he had fallen ill, and it had been necessary\r\nto bring him back to the markets. He knew every nook and corner of\r\nthem, and loved them with a filial affection, leading the agile life of\r\na squirrel in that forest of ironwork. He and Cadine, the hussy whom\r\nMother Chantemesse had picked up one night in the old Market of the\r\nInnocents, made a pretty couple\u2014he, a splendid foolish fellow, as\r\nglowing as a Rubens, with a ruddy down on his skin which attracted the\r\nsunlight; and she, slight and sly, with a comical phiz under her tangle\r\nof black curly hair.\r\n\r\nWhilst talking Claude quickened his steps, and soon brought his\r\ncompanion back to Saint Eustache again. Florent, whose legs were once\r\nmore giving way, dropped upon a bench near the omnibus office. The\r\nmorning air was freshening. At the far end of the Rue Rambuteau rosy\r\ngleams were streaking the milky sky, which higher up was slashed by\r\nbroad grey rifts. Such was the sweet balsamic scent of this dawn, that\r\nFlorent for a moment fancied himself in the open country, on the brow\r\nof a hill. But behind the bench Claude pointed out to him the many\r\naromatic herbs and bulbs on sale. All along the footway skirting the\r\ntripe market there were, so to say, fields of thyme and lavender,\r\ngarlic and shallots; and round the young plane-trees on the pavement\r\nthe vendors had twined long branches of laurel, forming trophies of\r\ngreenery. The strong scent of the laurel leaves prevailed over every\r\nother odour.\r\n\r\nAt present the luminous dial of Saint Eustache was paling as a\r\nnight-light does when surprised by the dawn. The gas jets in the wine\r\nshops in the neighbouring streets went out one by one, like stars\r\nextinguished by the brightness. And Florent gazed at the vast markets\r\nnow gradually emerging from the gloom, from the dreamland in which he\r\nhad beheld them, stretching out their ranges of open palaces.\r\nGreenish-grey in hue, they looked more solid now, and even more\r\ncolossal with their prodigious masting of columns upholding an endless\r\nexpanse of roofs. They rose up in geometrically shaped masses; and when\r\nall the inner lights had been extinguished and the square uniform\r\nbuildings were steeped in the rising dawn, they seemed typical of some\r\ngigantic modern machine, some engine, some caldron for the supply of a\r\nwhole people, some colossal belly, bolted and riveted, built up of wood\r\nand glass and iron, and endowed with all the elegance and power of some\r\nmechanical motive appliance working there with flaring furnaces, and\r\nwild, bewildering revolutions of wheels.\r\n\r\nClaude, however, had enthusiastically sprung on to the bench, and stood\r\nupon it. He compelled his companion to admire the effect of the dawn\r\nrising over the vegetables. There was a perfect sea of these extending\r\nbetween the two clusters of pavilions from Saint Eustache to the Rue\r\ndes Halles. And in the two open spaces at either end the flood of\r\ngreenery rose to even greater height, and quite submerged the\r\npavements. The dawn appeared slowly, softly grey in hue, and spreading\r\na light water-colour tint over everything. These surging piles akin to\r\nhurrying waves, this river of verdure rushing along the roadway like an\r\nautumn torrent, assumed delicate shadowy tints\u2014tender violet,\r\nblush-rose, and greeny yellow, all the soft, light hues which at\r\nsunrise make the sky look like a canopy of shot silk. And by degrees,\r\nas the fires of dawn rose higher and higher at the far end of the Rue\r\nRambuteau, the mass of vegetation grew brighter and brighter, emerging\r\nmore and more distinctly from the bluey gloom that clung to the ground.\r\nSalad herbs, cabbage-lettuce, endive, and succory, with rich soil still\r\nclinging to their roots, exposed their swelling hearts; bundles of\r\nspinach, bundles of sorrel, clusters of artichokes, piles of peas and\r\nbeans, mounds of cos-lettuce, tied round with straws, sounded every\r\nnote in the whole gamut of greenery, from the sheeny lacquer-like green\r\nof the pods to the deep-toned green of the foliage; a continuous gamut\r\nwith ascending and descending scales which died away in the variegated\r\ntones of the heads of celery and bundles of leeks. But the highest and\r\nmost sonorous notes still came from the patches of bright carrots and\r\nsnowy turnips, strewn in prodigious quantities all along the markets\r\nand lighting them up with the medley of their two colours.\r\n\r\nAt the crossway in the Rue des Halles cabbages were piled up in\r\nmountains; there were white ones, hard and compact as metal balls,\r\ncurly savoys, whose great leaves made them look like basins of green\r\nbronze, and red cabbages, which the dawn seemed to transform into\r\nsuperb masses of bloom with the hue of wine-lees, splotched with dark\r\npurple and carmine. At the other side of the markets, at the crossway\r\nnear Saint Eustache, the end of the Rue Rambuteau was blocked by a\r\nbarricade of orange-hued pumpkins, sprawling with swelling bellies in\r\ntwo superposed rows. And here and there gleamed the glistening ruddy\r\nbrown of a hamper of onions, the blood-red crimson of a heap of\r\ntomatoes, the quiet yellow of a display of marrows, and the sombre\r\nviolet of the fruit of the eggplant; while numerous fat black radishes\r\nstill left patches of gloom amidst the quivering brilliance of the\r\ngeneral awakening.\r\n\r\nClaude clapped his hands at the sight. He declared that those\r\n\u201Cblackguard vegetables\u201D were wild, mad, sublime! He stoutly maintained\r\nthat they were not yet dead, but, gathered in the previous evening,\r\nwaited for the morning sun to bid him good-bye from the flag-stones of\r\nthe market. He could observe their vitality, he declared, see their\r\nleaves stir and open as though their roots were yet firmly and warmly\r\nembedded in well-manured soil. And here, in the markets, he added, he\r\nheard the death-rattle of all the kitchen gardens of the environs of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nA crowd of white caps, loose black jackets, and blue blouses was\r\nswarming in the narrow paths between the various piles. The big baskets\r\nof the market porters passed along slowly, above the heads of the\r\nthrong. Retail dealers, costermongers, and greengrocers were making\r\ntheir purchases in haste. Corporals and nuns clustered round the\r\nmountains of cabbages, and college cooks prowled about inquisitively,\r\non the look-out for good bargains. The unloading was still going on;\r\nheavy tumbrels, discharging their contents as though these were so many\r\npaving-stones, added more and more waves to the sea of greenery which\r\nwas now beating against the opposite footways. And from the far end of\r\nthe Rue du Pont Neuf fresh rows of carts were still and ever arriving.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a fine sight it is!\u201D exclaimed Claude in an ecstasy of\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nFlorent was suffering keenly. He fancied that all this was some\r\nsupernatural temptation, and, unwilling to look at the markets any\r\nlonger, turned towards Saint Eustache, a side view of which he obtained\r\nfrom the spot where he now stood. With its roses, and broad arched\r\nwindows, its bell-turret, and roofs of slate, it looked as though\r\npainted in sepia against the blue of the sky. He fixed his eyes at last\r\non the sombre depths of the Rue Montorgueil, where fragments of gaudy\r\nsign boards showed conspicuously, and on the corner of the Rue\r\nMontmartre, where there were balconies gleaming with letters of gold.\r\nAnd when he again glanced at the cross-roads, his gaze was solicited by\r\nother sign boards, on which such inscriptions as \u201CDruggist and\r\nChemist,\u201D \u201CFlour and Grain\u201D appeared in big red and black capital\r\nletters upon faded backgrounds. Near these corners, houses with narrow\r\nwindows were now awakening, setting amidst the newness and airiness of\r\nthe Rue du Pont Neuf a few of the yellow ancient facades of olden\r\nParis. Standing at the empty windows of the great drapery shop at the\r\ncorner of the Rue Rambuteau a number of spruce-looking counter-jumpers\r\nin their shirt sleeves, with snowy-white wristbands and tight-fitting\r\npantaloons, were \u201Cdressing\u201D their goods. Farther away, in the windows\r\nof the severe looking, barrack-like Guillot establishment, biscuits in\r\ngilt wrappers and fancy cakes on glass stands were tastefully set out.\r\nAll the shops were now open; and workmen in white blouses, with tools\r\nunder their arms, were hurrying along the road.\r\n\r\nClaude had not yet got down from the bench. He was standing on tiptoe\r\nin order to see the farther down the streets. Suddenly, in the midst of\r\nthe crowd which he overlooked, he caught sight of a fair head with long\r\nwavy locks, followed by a little black one covered with curly tumbled\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\u201CHallo, Marjolin! Hallo, Cadine!\u201D he shouted; and then, as his voice\r\nwas drowned by the general uproar, he jumped to the ground and started\r\noff. But all at once, recollecting that he had left Florent behind him,\r\nhe hastily came back. \u201CI live at the end of the Impasse des\r\nBourdonnais,\u201D he said rapidly. \u201CMy name\u2019s written in chalk on the door,\r\nClaude Lantier. Come and see the etching of the Rue Pirouette.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he vanished. He was quite ignorant of Florent\u2019s name, and, after\r\nfavouring him with his views on art, parted from him as he had met him,\r\nat the roadside.\r\n\r\nFlorent was now alone, and at first this pleased him. Ever since Madame\r\nFrancoise had picked him up in the Avenue de Neuilly he had been coming\r\nand going in a state of pain fraught somnolence which had quite\r\nprevented him from forming any definite ideas of his surroundings. Now\r\nat last he was at liberty to do what he liked, and he tried to shake\r\nhimself free from that intolerable vision of teeming food by which he\r\nwas pursued. But his head still felt empty and dizzy, and all that he\r\ncould find within him was a kind of vague fear. The day was now growing\r\nquite bright, and he could be distinctly seen. He looked down at his\r\nwretched shabby coat and trousers. He buttoned the first, dusted the\r\nlatter, and strove to make a bit of a toilet, fearing lest those black\r\nrags of his should proclaim aloud whence he had come. He was seated in\r\nthe middle of the bench, by the side of some wandering vagabonds who\r\nhad settled themselves there while waiting for the sunrise. The\r\nneighbourhood of the markets is a favourite spot with vagrants in the\r\nsmall hours of the morning. However, two constables, still in night\r\nuniform, with cloaks and _kepis_, paced up and down the footway side by\r\nside, their hands resting behind their backs; and every time they\r\npassed the bench they glanced at the game which they scented there.\r\nFlorent felt sure that they recognised him, and were consulting\r\ntogether about arresting him. At this thought his anguish of mind\r\nbecame extreme. He felt a wild desire to get up and run away; but he\r\ndid not dare to do so, and was quite at a loss as to how he might take\r\nhimself off. The repeated glances of the constables, their cold,\r\ndeliberate scrutiny caused him the keenest torture. At length he rose\r\nfrom the bench, making a great effort to restrain himself from rushing\r\noff as quickly as his long legs could carry him; and succeeded in\r\nwalking quietly away, though his shoulders quivered in the fear he felt\r\nof suddenly feeling the rough hands of the constables clutching at his\r\ncollar from behind.\r\n\r\nHe had now only one thought, one desire, which was to get away from the\r\nmarkets as quickly as possible. He would wait and make his\r\ninvestigations later on, when the footways should be clear. The three\r\nstreets which met here\u2014the Rue Montmartre, Rue Montorgueil, and Rue\r\nTurbigo\u2014filled him with uneasiness. They were blocked by vehicles of\r\nall kinds, and their footways were crowded with vegetables. Florent\r\nwent straight along as far as the Rue Pierre Lescot, but there the\r\ncress and the potato markets seemed to him insuperable obstacles. So he\r\nresolved to take the Rue Rambuteau. On reaching the Boulevard de\r\nSebastopol, however, he came across such a block of vans and carts and\r\nwaggonettes that he turned back and proceeded along the Rue Saint\r\nDenis. Then he got amongst the vegetables once more. Retail dealers had\r\njust set up their stalls, formed of planks resting on tall hampers; and\r\nthe deluge of cabbages and carrots and turnips began all over again.\r\nThe markets were overflowing. Florent tried to make his escape from\r\nthis pursuing flood which ever overtook him in his flight. He tried the\r\nRue de la Cossonnerie, the Rue Berger, the Square des Innocents, the\r\nRue de la Ferronnerie, and the Rue des Halles. And at last he came to a\r\nstandstill, quite discouraged and scared at finding himself unable to\r\nescape from the infernal circle of vegetables, which now seemed to\r\ndance around him, twining clinging verdure about his legs.\r\n\r\nThe everlasting stream of carts and horses stretched away as far as the\r\nRue de Rivoli and the Place de l\u2019H\u00F4tel de Ville. Huge vans were\r\ncarrying away supplies for all the greengrocers and fruiterers of an\r\nentire district; _chars-a-bancs_ were starting for the suburbs with\r\nstraining, groaning sides. In the Rue de Pont Neuf Florent got\r\ncompletely bewildered. He stumbled upon a crowd of hand-carts, in which\r\nnumerous costermongers were arranging their purchases. Amongst them he\r\nrecognised Lacaille, who went off along the Rue Saint Honor\u00E9, pushing a\r\nbarrow of carrots and cauliflowers before him. Florent followed him, in\r\nthe hope that he would guide him out of the mob. The pavement was now\r\nquite slippery, although the weather was dry, and the litter of\r\nartichoke stalks, turnip tops, and leaves of all kinds made walking\r\nsomewhat dangerous. Florent stumbled at almost every step. He lost\r\nsight of Lacaille in the Rue Vauvilliers, and on approaching the corn\r\nmarket he again found the streets barricaded with vehicles. Then he\r\nmade no further attempt to struggle; he was once more in the clutch of\r\nthe markets, and their stream of life bore him back. Slowly retracing\r\nhis steps, he presently found himself by Saint Eustache again.\r\n\r\nHe now heard the loud continuous rumbling of the waggons that were\r\nsetting out from the markets. Paris was doling out the daily food of\r\nits two million inhabitants. These markets were like some huge central\r\norgan beating with giant force, and sending the blood of life through\r\nevery vein of the city. The uproar was akin to that of colossal jaws\u2014a\r\nmighty sound to which each phase of the provisioning contributed, from\r\nthe whip-cracking of the larger retail dealers as they started off for\r\nthe district markets to the dragging pit-a-pat of the old shoes worn by\r\nthe poor women who hawked their lettuces in baskets from door to door.\r\n\r\nFlorent turned into a covered way on the left, intersecting the group\r\nof four pavilions whose deep silent gloom he had remarked during the\r\nnight. He hoped that he might there find a refuge, discover some corner\r\nin which he could hide himself. But these pavilions were now as busy,\r\nas lively as the others. Florent walked on to the end of the street.\r\nDrays were driving up at a quick trot, crowding the market with cages\r\nfull of live poultry, and square hampers in which dead birds were\r\nstowed in deep layers. On the other side of the way were other drays\r\nfrom which porters were removing freshly killed calves, wrapped in\r\ncanvas, and laid at full length in baskets, whence only the four\r\nbleeding stumps of their legs protruded. There were also whole sheep,\r\nand sides and quarters of beef. Butchers in long white aprons marked\r\nthe meat with a stamp, carried it off, weighted it, and hung it up on\r\nhooks in the auction room. Florent, with his face close to the grating,\r\nstood gazing at the rows of hanging carcasses, at the ruddy sheep and\r\noxen and paler calves, all streaked with yellow fat and sinews, and\r\nwith bellies yawning open. Then he passed along the sidewalk where the\r\ntripe market was held, amidst the pallid calves\u2019 feet and heads, the\r\nrolled tripe neatly packed in boxes, the brains delicately set out in\r\nflat baskets, the sanguineous livers, and purplish kidneys. He checked\r\nhis steps in front of some long two-wheeled carts, covered with round\r\nawnings, and containing sides of pork hung on each side of the vehicle\r\nover a bed of straw. Seen from the back end, the interiors of the carts\r\nlooked like recesses of some tabernacle, like some taper-lighted\r\nchapel, such was the glow of all the bare flesh they contained. And on\r\nthe beds of straw were lines of tin cans, full of the blood that had\r\ntrickled from the pigs. Thereupon Florent was attacked by a sort of\r\nrage. The insipid odour of the meat, the pungent smell of the tripe\r\nexasperated him. He made his way out of the covered road, preferring to\r\nreturn once more to the footwalk of the Rue de Pont Neuf.\r\n\r\nHe was enduring perfect agony. The shiver of early morning came upon\r\nhim; his teeth chattered, and he was afraid of falling to the ground\r\nand finding himself unable to rise again. He looked about, but could\r\nsee no vacant place on any bench. Had he found one he would have\r\ndropped asleep there, even at the risk of being awakened by the police.\r\nThen, as giddiness nearly blinded him, he leaned for support against a\r\ntree, with his eyes closed and his ears ringing. The raw carrot, which\r\nhe had swallowed almost without chewing, was torturing his stomach, and\r\nthe glass of punch which he had drunk seemed to have intoxicated him.\r\nHe was indeed intoxicated with misery, weariness, and hunger. Again he\r\nfelt a burning fire in the pit of the stomach, to which he every now\r\nand then carried his hands, as though he were trying to stop up a hole\r\nthrough which all his life was oozing away. As he stood there he\r\nfancied that the foot-pavement rocked beneath him; and thinking that he\r\nmight perhaps lessen his sufferings by walking, he went straight on\r\nthrough the vegetables again. He lost himself among them. He went along\r\na narrow footway, turned down another, was forced to retrace his steps,\r\nbungled in doing so, and once more found himself amidst piles of\r\ngreenery. Some heaps were so high that people seemed to be walking\r\nbetween walls of bundles and bunches. Only their heads slightly\r\novertopped these ramparts, and passed along showing whitely or blackly\r\naccording to the colour of their hats or caps; whilst the huge swinging\r\nbaskets, carried aloft on a level with the greenery, looked like osier\r\nboats floating on a stagnant, mossy lake.\r\n\r\nFlorent stumbled against a thousand obstacles\u2014against porters taking up\r\ntheir burdens, and saleswomen disputing in rough tones. He slipped over\r\nthe thick bed of waste leaves and stumps which covered the footway, and\r\nwas almost suffocated by the powerful odour of crushed verdure. At last\r\nhe halted in a sort of confused stupor, and surrendered to the pushing\r\nof some and the insults of others; and then he became a mere waif, a\r\npiece of wreckage tossed about on the surface of that surging sea.\r\n\r\nHe was fast losing all self-respect, and would willingly have begged.\r\nThe recollection of his foolish pride during the night exasperated him.\r\nIf he had accepted Madame Francois\u2019s charity, if he had not felt such\r\nidiotic fear of Claude, he would not now have been stranded there\r\ngroaning in the midst of these cabbages. And he was especially angry\r\nwith himself for not having questioned the artist when they were in the\r\nRue Pirouette. Now, alas! he was alone and deserted, liable to die in\r\nthe streets like a homeless dog.\r\n\r\nFor the last time he raised his eyes and looked at the markets. At\r\npresent they were glittering in the sun. A broad ray was pouring\r\nthrough the covered road from the far end, cleaving the massy pavilions\r\nwith an arcade of light, whilst fiery beams rained down upon the far\r\nexpanse of roofs. The huge iron framework grew less distinct, assumed a\r\nbluey hue, became nothing but a shadowy silhouette outlined against the\r\nflaming flare of the sunrise. But up above a pane of glass took fire,\r\ndrops of light trickled down the broad sloping zinc plates to the\r\ngutterings; and then, below, a tumultuous city appeared amidst a haze\r\nof dancing golden dust. The general awakening had spread, from the\r\nfirst start of the market gardeners snoring in their cloaks, to the\r\nbrisk rolling of the food-laden railway drays. And the whole city was\r\nopening its iron gates, the footways were humming, the pavilions\r\nroaring with life. Shouts and cries of all kinds rent the air; it was\r\nas though the strain, which Florent had heard gathering force in the\r\ngloom ever since four in the morning, had now attained its fullest\r\nvolume. To the right and left, on all sides indeed, the sharp cries\r\naccompanying the auction sales sounded shrilly like flutes amidst the\r\nsonorous bass roar of the crowd. It was the fish, the butter, the\r\npoultry, and the meat being sold.\r\n\r\nThe pealing of bells passed through the air, imparting a quiver to the\r\nbuzzing of the opening markets. Around Florent the sun was setting the\r\nvegetables aflame. He no longer perceived any of those soft\r\nwater-colour tints which had predominated in the pale light of early\r\nmorning. The swelling hearts of the lettuces were now gleaming\r\nbrightly, the scales of greenery showed forth with wondrous vigour, the\r\ncarrots glowed blood-red, the turnips shone as if incandescent in the\r\ntriumphant radiance of the sun.\r\n\r\nOn Florent\u2019s left some waggons were discharging fresh loads of\r\ncabbages. He turned his eyes, and away in the distance saw carts yet\r\nstreaming out of the Rue Turbigo. The tide was still and ever rising.\r\nHe had felt it about his ankles, then on a level with his stomach, and\r\nnow it was threatening to drown him altogether. Blinded and submerged,\r\nhis ears buzzing, his stomach overpowered by all that he had seen, he\r\nasked for mercy; and wild grief took possession of him at the thought\r\nof dying there of starvation in the very heart of glutted Paris, amidst\r\nthe effulgent awakening of her markets. Big hot tears started from his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nWalking on, he had now reached one of the larger alleys. Two women, one\r\nshort and old, the other tall and withered, passed him, talking\r\ntogether as they made their way towards the pavilions.\r\n\r\n\u201CSo you\u2019ve come to do your marketing, Mademoiselle Saget?\u201D said the\r\ntall withered woman.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, yes, Madame Lec\u0153ur, if you can give it such a name as marketing.\r\nI\u2019m a lone woman, you know, and live on next to nothing. I should have\r\nliked a small cauliflower, but everything is so dear. How is butter\r\nselling to-day?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAt thirty-four sous. I have some which is first rate. Will you come\r\nand look at it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I don\u2019t know if I shall want any to-day; I\u2019ve still a little\r\nlard left.\u201D\r\n\r\nMaking a supreme effort, Florent followed these two women. He\r\nrecollected having heard Claude name the old one\u2014Mademoiselle\r\nSaget\u2014when they were in the Rue Pirouette; and he made up his mind to\r\nquestion her when she should have parted from her tall withered\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd how\u2019s your niece?\u201D Mademoiselle Saget now asked.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, La Sarriette does as she likes,\u201D Madame Lec\u0153ur replied in a bitter\r\ntone. \u201CShe\u2019s chosen to set up for herself and her affairs no longer\r\nconcern me. When her lovers have beggared her, she needn\u2019t come to me\r\nfor any bread.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you were so good to her, too! She ought to do well this year;\r\nfruit is yielding big profits. And your brother-in-law, how is he?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, he\u2014\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur bit her lips, and seemed disinclined to say anything\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\u201CStill the same as ever, I suppose?\u201D continued Mademoiselle Saget.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s a very worthy man. Still, I once heard it said that he spent his\r\nmoney in such a way that\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut does anyone know how he spends his money?\u201D interrupted Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur, with much asperity. \u201CHe\u2019s a miserly niggard, a scurvy fellow,\r\nthat\u2019s what I say! Do you know, mademoiselle, he\u2019d see me die of\r\nstarvation rather than lend me five francs! He knows quite well that\r\nthere\u2019s nothing to be made out of butter this season, any more than out\r\nof cheese and eggs; whereas he can sell as much poultry as ever he\r\nchooses. But not once, I assure you, not once has he offered to help\r\nme. I am too proud, as you know, to accept any assistance from him;\r\nstill it would have pleased me to have had it offered.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, by the way, there he is, your brother-in-law!\u201D suddenly exclaimed\r\nMademoiselle Saget, lowering her voice.\r\n\r\nThe two women turned and gazed at a man who was crossing the road to\r\nenter the covered way close by.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m in a hurry,\u201D murmured Madame Lec\u0153ur. \u201CI left my stall without\r\nanyone to look after it; and, besides, I don\u2019t want to speak to him.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, Florent also had mechanically turned round and glanced at the\r\nindividual referred to. This was a short, squarely-built man, with a\r\ncheery look and grey, close-cut brush-like hair. Under each arm he was\r\ncarrying a fat goose, whose head hung down and flapped against his\r\nlegs. And then all at once Florent made a gesture of delight.\r\nForgetting his fatigue, he ran after the man, and, overtaking him,\r\ntapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201CGavard!\u201D he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe other raised his head and stared with surprise at Florent\u2019s tall\r\nblack figure, which he did not at first recognise. Then all at once:\r\n\u201CWhat! is it you?\u201D he cried, as if overcome with amazement. \u201CIs it\r\nreally you?\u201D\r\n\r\nHe all but let his geese fall, and seemed unable to master his\r\nsurprise. On catching sight, however, of his sister-in-law and\r\nMademoiselle Saget, who were watching the meeting at a distance, he\r\nbegan to walk on again.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome along; don\u2019t let us stop here,\u201D he said. \u201CThere are too many eyes\r\nand tongues about.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen they were in the covered way they began to chat. Florent related\r\nhow he had gone to the Rue Pirouette, at which Gavard seemed much\r\namused and laughed heartily. Then he told Florent that his brother\r\nQuenu had moved from that street and had reopened his pork shop close\r\nby, in the Rue Rambuteau, just in front of the markets. And afterwards\r\nhe was again highly amused to hear that Florent had been wandering\r\nabout all that morning with Claude Lantier, an odd kind of fish, who,\r\nstrangely enough, said he, was Madame Quenu\u2019s nephew. Thus chatting,\r\nGavard was on the point of taking Florent straight to the pork shop,\r\nbut, on hearing that he had returned to France with false papers, he\r\nsuddenly assumed all sorts of solemn and mysterious airs, and insisted\r\nupon walking some fifteen paces in front of him, to avoid attracting\r\nattention. After passing through the poultry pavilion, where he hung\r\nhis geese up in his stall, he began to cross the Rue Rambuteau, still\r\nfollowed by Florent; and then, halting in the middle of the road, he\r\nglanced significantly towards a large and well-appointed pork shop.\r\n\r\nThe sun was obliquely enfilading the Rue Rambuteau, lighting up the\r\nfronts of the houses, in the midst of which the Rue Pirouette formed a\r\ndark gap. At the other end the great pile of Saint Eustache glittered\r\nbrightly in the sunlight like some huge reliquary. And right through\r\nthe crowd, from the distant crossway, an army of street-sweepers was\r\nadvancing in file down the road, the brooms swishing rhythmically,\r\nwhile scavengers provided with forks pitched the collected refuse into\r\ntumbrels, which at intervals of a score of paces halted with a noise\r\nlike the chattering of broken pots. However, all Florent\u2019s attention\r\nwas concentrated on the pork shop, open and radiant in the rising sun.\r\n\r\nIt stood very near the corner of the Rue Pirouette and provided quite a\r\nfeast for the eyes. Its aspect was bright and smiling, touches of\r\nbrilliant colour showing conspicuously amidst all the snowy marble. The\r\nsign board, on which the name of QUENU-GRADELLE glittered in fat gilt\r\nletters encircled by leaves and branches painted on a soft-hued\r\nbackground, was protected by a sheet of glass. On two panels, one on\r\neach side of the shop-front, and both, like the board above, covered\r\nwith glass, were paintings representing various chubby little cupids\r\nplaying amidst boars\u2019 heads, pork chops and strings of sausages; and\r\nthese latter still-life subjects, embellished with scrolls and bows,\r\nhad been painted in such soft tones that the uncooked pork which they\r\nrepresented had the pinkiness of raspberry jam. Within this pleasing\r\nframework arose the window display, arranged upon a bed of fine\r\nblue-paper shavings. Here and there fern-leaves, tastefully disposed,\r\nchanged the plates which they encircled into bouquets fringed with\r\nfoliage. There was a wealth of rich, luscious, melting things. Down\r\nbelow, quite close to the window, jars of preserved sausage-meat were\r\ninterspersed with pots of mustard. Above these were some small, plump,\r\nboned hams. Golden with their dressings of toasted bread-crumbs, and\r\nadorned at the knuckles with green rosettes. Next came the larger\r\ndishes, some containing preserved Strasburg tongues, enclosed in\r\nbladders coloured a bright red and varnished, so that they looked quite\r\nsanguineous beside the pale sausages and trotters; then there were\r\nblack-puddings coiled like harmless snakes, healthy looking\r\nchitterlings piled up two by two; Lyons sausages in little silver copes\r\nthat made them look like choristers; hot pies, with little banner-like\r\ntickets stuck in them; big hams, and great glazed joints of veal and\r\npork, whose jelly was as limpid as sugar-candy. In the rear were other\r\ndishes and earthen pans in which meat, minced and sliced, slumbered\r\nbeneath lakes of melted fat. And betwixt the various plates and dishes,\r\njars and bottle of sauce, cullis, stock and preserved truffles, pans of\r\n_foie gras_ and boxes of sardines and tunny-fish were strewn over the\r\nbed of paper shavings. A box of creamy cheeses, and one of edible\r\nsnails, the apertures of whose shells were dressed with butter and\r\nparsley, had been placed carelessly at either corner. Finally, from a\r\nbar overhead strings of sausages and saveloys of various sizes hung\r\ndown symmetrically like cords and tassels; while in the rear fragments\r\nof intestinal membranes showed like lacework, like some _guipure_ of\r\nwhite flesh. And on the highest tier in this sanctuary of gluttony,\r\namidst the membranes and between two bouquets of purple gladioli, the\r\nwindow stand was crowned by a small square aquarium, ornamented with\r\nrock-work, and containing a couple of gold-fish, which were continually\r\nswimming round it.\r\n\r\nFlorent\u2019s whole body thrilled at the sight. Then he perceived a woman\r\nstanding in the sunlight at the door of the shop. With her prosperous,\r\nhappy look in the midst of all those inviting things she added to the\r\ncherry aspect of the place. She was a fine woman and quite blocked the\r\ndoorway. Still, she was not over stout, but simply buxom, with the full\r\nripeness of her thirty years. She had only just risen, yet her glossy\r\nhair was already brushed smooth and arranged in little flat bands over\r\nher temples, giving her an appearance of extreme neatness. She had the\r\nfine skin, the pinky-white complexion common to those whose life is\r\nspent in an atmosphere of raw meat and fat. There was a touch of\r\ngravity about her demeanour, her movements were calm and slow; what\r\nmirth or pleasure she felt she expressed by her eyes, her lips\r\nretaining all their seriousness. A collar of starched linen encircled\r\nher neck, white sleevelets reached to her elbows, and a white apron\r\nfell even over the tips of her shoes, so that you saw but little of her\r\nblack cashmere dress, which clung tightly to her well-rounded shoulders\r\nand swelling bosom. The sun rays poured hotly upon all the whiteness\r\nshe displayed. However, although her bluish-black hair, her rosy face,\r\nand bright sleeves and apron were steeped in the glow of light, she\r\nnever once blinked, but enjoyed her morning bath of sunshine with\r\nblissful tranquillity, her soft eyes smiling the while at the flow and\r\nriot of the markets. She had the appearance of a very worthy woman.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is your brother\u2019s wife, your sister-in-law, Lisa,\u201D Gavard said to\r\nFlorent.\r\n\r\nHe had saluted her with a slight inclination of the head. Then he\r\ndarted along the house passage, continuing to take the most minute\r\nprecautions, and unwilling to let Florent enter the premises through\r\nthe shop, though there was no one there. It was evident that he felt\r\ngreat pleasure in dabbling in what he considered to be a compromising\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\u201CWait here,\u201D he said, \u201Cwhile I go to see whether your brother is alone.\r\nYou can come in when I clap my hands.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon he opened a door at the end of the passage. But as soon as\r\nFlorent heard his brother\u2019s voice behind it, he sprang inside at a\r\nbound. Quenu, who was much attached to him, threw his arms round his\r\nneck, and they kissed each other like children.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! dash it all! Is it really you, my dear fellow?\u201D stammered the pork\r\nbutcher. \u201CI never expected to see you again. I felt sure you were dead!\r\nWhy, only yesterday I was saying to Lisa, \u2018That poor fellow, Florent!\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, he stopped short, and popping his head into the shop, called\r\nout, \u201CLisa! Lisa!\u201D Then turning towards a little girl who had crept\r\ninto a corner, he added, \u201CPauline, go and find your mother.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe little one did not stir, however. She was an extremely fine child,\r\nfive years of age, with a plump chubby face, bearing a strong\r\nresemblance to that of the pork butcher\u2019s wife. In her arms she was\r\nholding a huge yellow cat, which had cheerfully surrendered itself to\r\nher embrace, with its legs dangling downwards; and she now squeezed it\r\ntightly with her little arms, as if she were afraid that yonder\r\nshabby-looking gentleman might rob her of it.\r\n\r\nLisa, however, leisurely made her appearance.\r\n\r\n\u201CHere is my brother Florent!\u201D exclaimed Quenu.\r\n\r\nLisa addressed him as \u201CMonsieur,\u201D and gave him a kindly welcome. She\r\nscanned him quietly from head to foot, without evincing any\r\ndisagreeable surprise. Merely a faint pout appeared for a moment on her\r\nlips. Then, standing by, she began to smile at her husband\u2019s\r\ndemonstrations of affection. Quenu, however, at last recovered his\r\ncalmness, and noticing Florent\u2019s fleshless, poverty-stricken\r\nappearance, exclaimed: \u201CAh, my poor fellow, you haven\u2019t improved in\r\nyour looks since you were over yonder. For my part, I\u2019ve grown fat; but\r\nwhat would you have!\u201D\r\n\r\nHe had indeed grown fat, too fat for his thirty years. He seemed to be\r\nbursting through his shirt and apron, through all the snowy-white linen\r\nin which he was swathed like a huge doll. With advancing years his\r\nclean-shaven face had become elongated, assuming a faint resemblance to\r\nthe snout of one of those pigs amidst whose flesh his hands worked and\r\nlived the whole day through. Florent scarcely recognised him. He had\r\nnow seated himself, and his glance turned from his brother to handsome\r\nLisa and little Pauline. They were all brimful of health, squarely\r\nbuilt, sleek, in prime condition; and in their turn they looked at\r\nFlorent with the uneasy astonishment which corpulent people feel at the\r\nsight of a scraggy person. The very cat, whose skin was distended by\r\nfat, dilated its yellow eyes and scrutinised him with an air of\r\ndistrust.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll wait till we have breakfast, won\u2019t you?\u201D asked Quenu. \u201CWe have\r\nit early, at ten o\u2019clock.\u201D\r\n\r\nA penetrating odour of cookery pervaded the place; and Florent looked\r\nback upon the terrible night which he had just spent, his arrival\r\namongst the vegetables, his agony in the midst of the markets, the\r\nendless avalanches of food from which he had just escaped. And then in\r\na low tone and with a gentle smile he responded:\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; I\u2019m really very hungry, you see.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorent had just begun to study law in Paris when his mother died. She\r\nlived at Le Vigan, in the department of the Gard, and had taken for her\r\nsecond husband one Quenu, a native of Yvetot in Normandy, whom some\r\nsub-prefect had transplanted to the south and then forgotten there. He\r\nhad remained in employment at the sub-prefecture, finding the country\r\ncharming, the wine good, and the women very amiable. Three years after\r\nhis marriage he had been carried off by a bad attack of indigestion,\r\nleaving as sole legacy to his wife a sturdy boy who resembled him. It\r\nwas only with very great difficulty that the widow could pay the\r\ncollege fees of Florent, her elder son, the issue of her first\r\nmarriage. He was a very gentle youth, devoted to his studies, and\r\nconstantly won the chief prizes at school. It was upon him that his\r\nmother lavished all her affection and based all her hopes. Perhaps, in\r\nbestowing so much love on this slim pale youth, she was giving evidence\r\nof her preference for her first husband, a tender-hearted, caressing\r\nProven\u00E7al, who had loved her devotedly. Quenu, whose good humour and\r\namiability had at first attracted her, had perhaps displayed too much\r\nself-satisfaction, and shown too plainly that he looked upon himself as\r\nthe main source of happiness. At all events she formed the opinion that\r\nher younger son\u2014and in southern families younger sons are still often\r\nsacrificed\u2014would never do any good; so she contented herself with\r\nsending him to a school kept by a neighbouring old maid, where the lad\r\nlearned nothing but how to idle his time away. The two brothers grew up\r\nfar apart from each other, as though they were strangers.\r\n\r\nWhen Florent arrived at Le Vigan his mother was already buried. She had\r\ninsisted upon having her illness concealed from him till the very last\r\nmoment, for fear of disturbing his studies. Thus he found little Quenu,\r\nwho was then twelve years old, sitting and sobbing alone on a table in\r\nthe middle of the kitchen. A furniture dealer, a neighbour, gave him\r\nparticulars of his mother\u2019s last hours. She had reached the end of her\r\nresources, had killed herself by the hard work which she had undertaken\r\nto earn sufficient money that her elder son might continue his legal\r\nstudies. To her modest trade in ribbons, the profits of which were but\r\nsmall, she had been obliged to add other occupations, which kept her up\r\nvery late at night. Her one idea of seeing Florent established as an\r\nadvocate, holding a good position in the town, had gradually caused her\r\nto become hard and miserly, without pity for either herself or others.\r\nLittle Quenu was allowed to wander about in ragged breeches, and in\r\nblouses from which the sleeves were falling away. He never dared to\r\nserve himself at table, but waited till he received his allowance of\r\nbread from his mother\u2019s hands. She gave herself equally thin slices,\r\nand it was to the effects of this regimen that she had succumbed, in\r\ndeep despair at having failed to accomplish her self-allotted task.\r\n\r\nThis story made a most painful impression upon Florent\u2019s tender nature,\r\nand his sobs wellnigh choked him. He took his little half brother in\r\nhis arms, held him to his breast, and kissed him as though to restore\r\nto him the love of which he had unwittingly deprived him. Then he\r\nlooked at the lad\u2019s gaping shoes, torn sleeves, and dirty hands, at all\r\nthe manifest signs of wretchedness and neglect. And he told him that he\r\nwould take him away, and that they would both live happily together.\r\nThe next day, when he began to inquire into affairs, he felt afraid\r\nthat he would not be able to keep sufficient money to pay for the\r\njourney back to Paris. However, he was determined to leave Le Vigan at\r\nany cost. He was fortunately able to sell the little ribbon business,\r\nand this enabled him to discharge his mother\u2019s debts, for despite her\r\nstrictness in money matters she had gradually run up bills. Then, as\r\nthere was nothing left, his mother\u2019s neighbour, the furniture dealer,\r\noffered him five hundred francs for her chattels and stock of linen. It\r\nwas a very good bargain for the dealer, but the young man thanked him\r\nwith tears in his eyes. He bought his brother some new clothes, and\r\ntook him away that same evening.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Paris he gave up all thought of continuing to attend\r\nthe Law School, and postponed every ambitious project. He obtained a\r\nfew pupils, and established himself with little Quenu in the Rue Royer\r\nCollard, at the corner of the Rue Saint Jacques, in a big room which he\r\nfurnished with two iron bedsteads, a wardrobe, a table, and four\r\nchairs. He now had a child to look after, and this assumed paternity\r\nwas very pleasing to him. During the earlier days he attempted to give\r\nthe lad some lessons when he returned home in the evening, but Quenu\r\nwas an unwilling pupil. He was dull of understanding, and refused to\r\nlearn, bursting into tears and regretfully recalling the time when his\r\nmother had allowed him to run wild in the streets. Florent thereupon\r\nstopped his lessons in despair, and to console the lad promised him a\r\nholiday of indefinite length. As an excuse for his own weakness he\r\nrepeated that he had not brought his brother to Paris to distress him.\r\nTo see him grow up in happiness became his chief desire. He quite\r\nworshipped the boy, was charmed with his merry laughter, and felt\r\ninfinite joy in seeing him about him, healthy and vigorous, and without\r\na care. Florent for his part remained very slim and lean in his\r\nthreadbare coat, and his face began to turn yellow amidst all the\r\ndrudgery and worry of teaching; but Quenu grew up plump and merry, a\r\nlittle dense, indeed, and scarce able to read or write, but endowed\r\nwith high spirits which nothing could ruffle, and which filled the big\r\ngloomy room in the Rue Royer Collard with gaiety.\r\n\r\nYears, meantime, passed by. Florent, who had inherited all his mother\u2019s\r\nspirit of devotion, kept Quenu at home as though he were a big, idle\r\ngirl. He did not even suffer him to perform any petty domestic duties,\r\nbut always went to buy the provisions himself, and attended to the\r\ncooking and other necessary matters. This kept him, he said, from\r\nindulging in his own bad thoughts. He was given to gloominess, and\r\nfancied that he was disposed to evil. When he returned home in the\r\nevening, splashed with mud, and his head bowed by the annoyances to\r\nwhich other people\u2019s children had subjected him, his heart melted\r\nbeneath the embrace of the sturdy lad whom he found spinning his top on\r\nthe tiled flooring of the big room. Quenu laughed at his brother\u2019s\r\nclumsiness in making omelettes, and at the serious fashion in which he\r\nprepared the soup-beef and vegetables. When the lamp was extinguished,\r\nand Florent lay in bed, he sometimes gave way to feelings of sadness.\r\nHe longed to resume his legal studies, and strove to map out his duties\r\nin such wise as to secure time to follow the programme of the faculty.\r\nHe succeeded in doing this, and was then perfectly happy. But a slight\r\nattack of fever, which confined him to his room for a week, made such a\r\nhole in his purse, and caused him so much alarm, that he abandoned all\r\nidea of completing his studies. The boy was now getting a big fellow,\r\nand Florent took a post as teacher in a school in the Rue de\r\nl\u2019Estrapade, at a salary of eighteen hundred francs per annum. This\r\nseemed like a fortune to him. By dint of economy he hoped to be able to\r\namass a sum of money which would set Quenu going in the world. When the\r\nlad reached his eighteenth year Florent still treated him as though he\r\nwere a daughter for whom a dowry must be provided.\r\n\r\nHowever, during his brother\u2019s brief illness Quenu himself had made\r\ncertain reflections. One morning he proclaimed his desire to work,\r\nsaying that he was now old enough to earn his own living. Florent was\r\ndeeply touched at this. Just opposite, on the other side of the street,\r\nlived a working watchmaker whom Quenu, through the curtainless window,\r\ncould see leaning over a little table, manipulating all sorts of\r\ndelicate things, and patiently gazing at them through a magnifying\r\nglass all day long. The lad was much attracted by the sight, and\r\ndeclared that he had a taste for watchmaking. At the end of a\r\nfortnight, however, he became restless, and began to cry like a child\r\nof ten, complaining that the work was too complicated, and that he\r\nwould never be able to understand all the silly little things that\r\nenter into the construction of a watch.\r\n\r\nHis next whim was to be a locksmith; but this calling he found too\r\nfatiguing. In a couple of years he tried more than ten different\r\ntrades. Florent opined that he acted rightly, that it was wrong to take\r\nup a calling one did not like. However, Quenu\u2019s fine eagerness to work\r\nfor his living strained the resources of the little establishment very\r\nseriously. Since he had begun flitting from one workshop to another\r\nthere had been a constant succession of fresh expenses; money had gone\r\nin new clothes, in meals taken away from home, and in the payment of\r\nfootings among fellow workmen. Florent\u2019s salary of eighteen hundred\r\nfrancs was no longer sufficient, and he was obliged to take a couple of\r\npupils in the evenings. For eight years he had continued to wear the\r\nsame old coat.\r\n\r\nHowever, the two brothers had made a friend. One side of the house in\r\nwhich they lived overlooked the Rue Saint Jacques, where there was a\r\nlarge poultry-roasting establishment[*] kept by a worthy man called\r\nGavard, whose wife was dying from consumption amidst an atmosphere\r\nredolent of plump fowls. When Florent returned home too late to cook a\r\nscrap of meat, he was in the habit of laying out a dozen sous or so on\r\na small portion of turkey or goose at this shop. Such days were feast\r\ndays. Gavard in time grew interested in this tall, scraggy customer,\r\nlearned his history, and invited Quenu into his shop. Before long the\r\nyoung fellow was constantly to be found there. As soon as his brother\r\nleft the house he came downstairs and installed himself at the rear of\r\nthe roasting shop, quite enraptured with the four huge spits which\r\nturned with a gentle sound in front of the tall bright flames.\r\n\r\n[*] These rotisseries, now all but extinct, were at one time a\r\nparticular feature of the Parisian provision trade. I can myself\r\nrecollect several akin to the one described by M. Zola. I suspect that\r\nthey largely owed their origin to the form and dimensions of the\r\nordinary Parisian kitchen stove, which did not enable people to roast\r\npoultry at home in a convenient way. In the old French cuisine,\r\nmoreover, roast joints of meat were virtually unknown; roasting was\r\nalmost entirely confined to chickens, geese, turkeys, pheasants, etc.;\r\nand among the middle classes people largely bought their poultry\r\nalready cooked of the _rotisseur_, or else confided it to him for the\r\npurpose of roasting, in the same way as our poorer classes still send\r\ntheir joints to the baker\u2019s. Roasting was also long looked upon in\r\nFrance as a very delicate art. Brillat-Savarin, in his famous\r\n_Physiologie du Gout_, lays down the dictum that \u201CA man may become a\r\ncook, but is born a _rotisseur_.\u201D\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broad copper bands of the fireplace glistened brightly, the poultry\r\nsteamed, the fat bubbled melodiously in the dripping-pan, and the spits\r\nseemed to talk amongst themselves and to address kindly words to Quenu,\r\nwho, with a long ladle, devoutly basted the golden breasts of the fat\r\ngeese and turkeys. He would stay there for hours, quite crimson in the\r\ndancing glow of the flames, and laughing vaguely, with a somewhat\r\nstupid expression, at the birds roasting in front of him. Indeed, he\r\ndid not awake from this kind of trance until the geese and turkeys were\r\nunspitted. They were placed on dishes, the spits emerged from their\r\ncarcasses smoking hot, and a rich gravy flowed from either end and\r\nfilled the shop with a penetrating odour. Then the lad, who, standing\r\nup, had eagerly followed every phase of the dishing, would clap his\r\nhands and begin to talk to the birds, telling them that they were very\r\nnice, and would be eaten up, and that the cats would have nothing but\r\ntheir bones. And he would give a start of delight whenever Gavard\r\nhanded him a slice of bread, which he forthwith put into the\r\ndripping-pan that it might soak and toast there for half an hour.\r\n\r\nIt was in this shop, no doubt, that Quenu\u2019s love of cookery took its\r\nbirth. Later on, when he had tried all sorts of crafts, he returned, as\r\nthough driven by fate, to the spits and the poultry and the savoury\r\ngravy which induces one to lick one\u2019s fingers. At first he was afraid\r\nof vexing his brother, who was a small eater and spoke of good fare\r\nwith the disdain of a man who is ignorant of it; but afterwards, on\r\nseeing that Florent listened to him when he explained the preparation\r\nof some very elaborate dish, he confessed his desires and presently\r\nfound a situation at a large restaurant. From that time forward the\r\nlife of the two brothers was settled. They continued to live in the\r\nroom in the Rue Royer Collard, whither they returned every evening; the\r\none glowing and radiant from his hot fire, the other with the depressed\r\ncountenance of a shabby, impecunious teacher. Florent still wore his\r\nold black coat, as he sat absorbed in correcting his pupils\u2019 exercises;\r\nwhile Quenu, to put himself more at ease, donned his white apron, cap,\r\nand jacket, and, flitting about in front of the stove, amused himself\r\nby baking some dainty in the oven. Sometimes they smiled at seeing\r\nthemselves thus attired, the one all in black, the other all in white.\r\nThese different garbs, one bright and the other sombre, seemed to make\r\nthe big room half gay and half mournful. Never, however, was there so\r\nmuch harmony in a household marked by such dissimilarity. Though the\r\nelder brother grew thinner and thinner, consumed by the ardent\r\ntemperament which he had inherited from his Proven\u00E7al father, and the\r\nyounger one waxed fatter and fatter like a true son of Normandy, they\r\nloved each other in the brotherhood they derived from their mother\u2014a\r\nmother who had been all devotion.\r\n\r\nThey had a relation in Paris, a brother of their mother\u2019s, one\r\nGradelle, who was in business as a pork butcher in the Rue Pirouette,\r\nnear the central markets. He was a fat, hard-hearted, miserly fellow,\r\nand received his nephews as though they were starving paupers the first\r\ntime they paid him a visit. They seldom went to see him afterwards. On\r\nhis nameday Quenu would take him a bunch of flowers, and receive a\r\nhalf-franc piece in return for it. Florent\u2019s proud and sensitive nature\r\nsuffered keenly when Gradelle scrutinised his shabby clothes with the\r\nanxious, suspicious glance of a miser apprehending a request for a\r\ndinner, or the loan of a five-franc piece. One day, however, it\r\noccurred to Florent in all artlessness to ask his uncle to change a\r\nhundred-franc note for him, and after this the pork butcher showed less\r\nalarm at sight of the lads, as he called them. Still, their friendship\r\ngot no further than these infrequent visits.\r\n\r\nThese years were like a long, sweet, sad dream to Florent. As they\r\npassed he tasted to the full all the bitter joys of self-sacrifice. At\r\nhome, in the big room, life was all love and tenderness; but out in the\r\nworld, amidst the humiliations inflicted on him by his pupils, and the\r\nrough jostling of the streets, he felt himself yielding to wicked\r\nthoughts. His slain ambitions embittered him. It was long before he\r\ncould bring himself to bow to his fate, and accept with equanimity the\r\npainful lot of a poor, plain, commonplace man. At last, to guard\r\nagainst the temptations of wickedness, he plunged into ideal goodness,\r\nand sought refuge in a self-created sphere of absolute truth and\r\njustice. It was then that he became a republican, entering into the\r\nrepublican idea even as heart-broken girls enter a convent. And not\r\nfinding a republic where sufficient peace and kindliness prevailed to\r\nlull his troubles to sleep, he created one for himself. He took no\r\npleasure in books. All the blackened paper amidst which he lived spoke\r\nof evil-smelling class-rooms, of pellets of paper chewed by unruly\r\nschoolboys, of long, profitless hours of torture. Besides, books only\r\nsuggested to him a spirit of mutiny and pride, whereas it was of peace\r\nand oblivion that he felt most need. To lull and soothe himself with\r\nthe ideal imaginings, to dream that he was perfectly happy, and that\r\nall the world would likewise become so, to erect in his brain the\r\nrepublican city in which he would fain have lived, such now became his\r\nrecreation, the task, again and again renewed, of all his leisure\r\nhours. He no longer read any books beyond those which his duties\r\ncompelled him to peruse; he preferred to tramp along the Rue Saint\r\nJacques as far as the outer boulevards, occasionally going yet a\r\ngreater distance and returning by the Barriere d\u2019Italie; and all along\r\nthe road, with his eyes on the Quartier Mouffetard spread out at his\r\nfeet, he would devise reforms of great moral and humanitarian scope,\r\nsuch as he thought would change that city of suffering into an abode of\r\nbliss. During the turmoil of February 1848, when Paris was stained with\r\nblood he became quite heartbroken, and rushed from one to another of\r\nthe public clubs demanding that the blood which had been shed should\r\nfind atonement in \u201Cthe fraternal embrace of all republicans throughout\r\nthe world.\u201D He became one of those enthusiastic orators who preached\r\nrevolution as a new religion, full of gentleness and salvation. The\r\nterrible days of December 1851, the days of the Coup d\u2019Etat, were\r\nrequired to wean him from his doctrines of universal love. He was then\r\nwithout arms; allowed himself to be captured like a sheep, and was\r\ntreated as though he were a wolf. He awoke from his sermon on universal\r\nbrotherhood to find himself starving on the cold stones of a casemate\r\nat Bic\u00EAtre.\r\n\r\nQuenu, when two and twenty, was distressed with anguish when his\r\nbrother did not return home. On the following day he went to seek his\r\ncorpse at the cemetery of Montmartre, where the bodies of those shot\r\ndown on the boulevards had been laid out in a line and covered with\r\nstraw, from beneath which only their ghastly heads projected. However,\r\nQuenu\u2019s courage failed him, he was blinded by his tears, and had to\r\npass twice along the line of corpses before acquiring the certainty\r\nthat Florent\u2019s was not among them. At last, at the end of a long and\r\nwretched week, he learned at the Prefecture of Police that his brother\r\nwas a prisoner. He was not allowed to see him, and when he pressed the\r\nmatter the police threatened to arrest him also. Then he hastened off\r\nto his uncle Gradelle, whom he looked upon as a person of importance,\r\nhoping that he might be able to enlist his influence in Florent\u2019s\r\nbehalf. But Gradelle waxed wrathful, declared that Florent deserved his\r\nfate, that he ought to have known better than to have mixed himself up\r\nwith those rascally republicans. And he even added that Florent was\r\ndestined to turn out badly, that it was written on his face.\r\n\r\nQuenu wept copiously and remained there, almost choked by his sobs. His\r\nuncle, a little ashamed of his harshness, and feeling that he ought to\r\ndo something for him, offered to receive him into his house. He wanted\r\nan assistant, and knew that his nephew was a good cook. Quenu was so\r\nmuch alarmed by the mere thought of going back to live alone in the big\r\nroom in the Rue Royer Collard, that then and there he accepted\r\nGradelle\u2019s offer. That same night he slept in his uncle\u2019s house, in a\r\ndark hole of a garret just under the room, where there was scarcely\r\nspace for him to lie at full length. However, he was less wretched\r\nthere than he would have been opposite his brother\u2019s empty couch.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded at length in obtaining permission to see Florent; but on\r\nhis return from Bic\u00EAtre he was obliged to take to his bed. For nearly\r\nthree weeks he lay fever-stricken, in a stupefied, comatose state.\r\nGradelle meantime called down all sorts of maledictions on his\r\nrepublican nephew; and one morning, when he heard of Florent\u2019s\r\ndeparture for Cayenne, he went upstairs, tapped Quenu on the hands,\r\nawoke him, and bluntly told him the news, thereby bringing about such a\r\nreaction that on the following day the young man was up and about\r\nagain. His grief wore itself out, and his soft flabby flesh seemed to\r\nabsorb his tears. A month later he laughed again, and then grew vexed\r\nand unhappy with himself for having been merry; but his natural\r\nlight-heartedness soon gained the mastery, and he laughed afresh in\r\nunconscious happiness.\r\n\r\nHe now learned his uncle\u2019s business, from which he derived even more\r\nenjoyment than from cookery. Gradelle told him, however, that he must\r\nnot neglect his pots and pans, that it was rare to find a pork butcher\r\nwho was also a good cook, and that he had been lucky in serving in a\r\nrestaurant before coming to the shop. Gradelle, moreover, made full use\r\nof his nephew\u2019s acquirements, employed him to cook the dinners sent out\r\nto certain customers, and placed all the broiling, and the preparation\r\nof pork chops garnished with gherkins in his special charge. As the\r\nyoung man was of real service to him, he grew fond of him after his own\r\nfashion, and would nip his plump arms when he was in a good humour.\r\nGradelle had sold the scanty furniture of the room in the Rue Royer\r\nCollard and retained possession of the proceeds\u2014some forty francs or\r\nso\u2014in order, said he, to prevent the foolish lad, Quenu, from making\r\nducks and drakes of the cash. After a time, however, he allowed his\r\nnephew six francs a month a pocket-money.\r\n\r\nQuenu now became quite happy, in spite of the emptiness of his purse\r\nand the harshness with which he was occasionally treated. He liked to\r\nhave life doled out to him; Florent had treated him too much like an\r\nindolent girl. Moreover, he had made a friend at his uncle\u2019s. Gradelle,\r\nwhen his wife died, had been obliged to engage a girl to attend to the\r\nshop, and had taken care to choose a healthy and attractive one,\r\nknowing that a good-looking girl would set off his viands and help to\r\ntempt custom. Amongst his acquaintances was a widow, living in the Rue\r\nCuvier, near the Jardin des Plantes, whose deceased husband had been\r\npostmaster at Plassans, the seat of a sub-prefecture in the south of\r\nFrance. This lady, who lived in a very modest fashion on a small\r\nannuity, had brought with her from Plassans a plump, pretty child, whom\r\nshe treated as her own daughter. Lisa, as the young one was called,\r\nattended upon her with much placidity and serenity of disposition.\r\nSomewhat seriously inclined, she looked quite beautiful when she\r\nsmiled. Indeed, her great charm came from the exquisite manner in which\r\nshe allowed this infrequent smile of hers to escape her. Her eyes then\r\nbecame most caressing, and her habitual gravity imparted inestimable\r\nvalue to these sudden, seductive flashes. The old lady had often said\r\nthat one of Lisa\u2019s smiles would suffice to lure her to perdition.\r\n\r\nWhen the widow died she left all her savings, amounting to some ten\r\nthousand francs, to her adopted daughter. For a week Lisa lived alone\r\nin the Rue Cuvier; it was there that Gradelle came in search of her. He\r\nhad become acquainted with her by often seeing her with her mistress\r\nwhen the latter called on him in the Rue Pirouette; and at the funeral\r\nshe had struck him as having grown so handsome and sturdy that he had\r\nfollowed the hearse all the way to the cemetery, though he had not\r\nintended to do so. As the coffin was being lowered into the grave, he\r\nreflected what a splendid girl she would be for the counter of a pork\r\nbutcher\u2019s shop. He thought the matter over, and finally resolved to\r\noffer her thirty francs a month, with board and lodging. When he made\r\nthis proposal, Lisa asked for twenty-four hours to consider it. Then\r\nshe arrived one morning with a little bundle of clothes, and her ten\r\nthousand francs concealed in the bosom of her dress. A month later the\r\nwhole place belonged to her; she enslaved Gradelle, Quenu, and even the\r\nsmallest kitchen-boy. For his part, Quenu would have cut off his\r\nfingers to please her. When she happened to smile, he remained rooted\r\nto the floor, laughing with delight as he gazed at her.\r\n\r\nLisa was the eldest daughter of the Macquarts of Plassans, and her\r\nfather was still alive.[*] But she said that he was abroad, and never\r\nwrote to him. Sometimes she just dropped a hint that her mother, now\r\ndeceased, had been a hard worker, and that she took after her. She\r\nworked, indeed, very assiduously. However, she sometimes added that the\r\nworthy woman had slaved herself to death in striving to support her\r\nfamily. Then she would speak of the respective duties of husband and\r\nwife in such a practical though modest fashion as to enchant Quenu. He\r\nassured her that he fully shared her ideas. These were that everyone,\r\nman or woman, ought to work for his or her living, that everyone was\r\ncharged with the duty of achieving personal happiness, that great harm\r\nwas done by encouraging habits of idleness, and that the presence of so\r\nmuch misery in the world was greatly due to sloth. This theory of hers\r\nwas a sweeping condemnation of drunkenness, of all the legendary\r\nloafing ways of her father Macquart. But, though she did not know it,\r\nthere was much of Macquart\u2019s nature in herself. She was merely a\r\nsteady, sensible Macquart with a logical desire for comfort, having\r\ngrasped the truth of the proverb that as you make your bed so you lie\r\non it. To sleep in blissful warmth there is no better plan than to\r\nprepare oneself a soft and downy couch; and to the preparation of such\r\na couch she gave all her time and all her thoughts. When no more than\r\nsix years old she had consented to remain quietly on her chair the\r\nwhole day through on condition that she should be rewarded with a cake\r\nin the evening.\r\n\r\n[*] See M. Zola\u2019s novel, _The Fortune of the Rougons_.\u2014Translator\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Gradelle\u2019s establishment Lisa went on leading the calm, methodical\r\nlife which her exquisite smiles illumined. She had not accepted the\r\npork butcher\u2019s offer at random. She reckoned upon finding a guardian in\r\nhim; with the keen scent of those who are born lucky she perhaps\r\nforesaw that the gloomy shop in the Rue Pirouette would bring her the\r\ncomfortable future she dreamed of\u2014a life of healthy enjoyment, and work\r\nwithout fatigue, each hour of which would bring its own reward. She\r\nattended to her counter with the quiet earnestness with which she had\r\nwaited upon the postmaster\u2019s widow; and the cleanliness of her aprons\r\nsoon became proverbial in the neighbourhood. Uncle Gradelle was so\r\ncharmed with this pretty girl that sometimes, as he was stringing his\r\nsausages, he would say to Quenu: \u201CUpon my word, if I weren\u2019t turned\r\nsixty, I think I should be foolish enough to marry her. A wife like\r\nshe\u2019d make is worth her weight in gold to a shopkeeper, my lad.\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu himself was growing still fonder of her, though he laughed\r\nmerrily one day when a neighbour accused him of being in love with\r\nLisa. He was not worried with love-sickness. The two were very good\r\nfriends, however. In the evening they went up to their bedrooms\r\ntogether. Lisa slept in a little chamber adjoining the dark hole which\r\nthe young man occupied. She had made this room of hers quite bright by\r\nhanging it with muslin curtains. The pair would stand together for a\r\nmoment on the landing, holding their candles in their hands, and\r\nchatting as they unlocked their doors. Then, as they closed them, they\r\nsaid in friendly tones:\r\n\r\n\u201CGood night, Mademoiselle Lisa.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood night, Monsieur Quenu.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs Quenu undressed himself he listened to Lisa making her own\r\npreparations. The partition between the two rooms was very thin.\r\n\u201CThere, she is drawing her curtains now,\u201D he would say to himself;\r\n\u201Cwhat can she be doing, I wonder, in front of her chest of drawers? Ah!\r\nshe\u2019s sitting down now and taking off her shoes. Now she\u2019s blown her\r\ncandle out. Well, good night. I must get to sleep\u201D; and at times, when\r\nhe heard her bed creak as she got into it, he would say to himself with\r\na smile, \u201CDash it all! Mademoiselle Lisa is no feather.\u201D This idea\r\nseemed to amuse him, and presently he would fall asleep thinking about\r\nthe hams and salt pork that he had to prepare the next morning.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs went on for a year without causing Lisa a single\r\nblush or Quenu a moment\u2019s embarrassment. When the girl came into the\r\nkitchen in the morning at the busiest moment of the day\u2019s work, they\r\ngrasped hands over the dishes of sausage-meat. Sometimes she helped\r\nhim, holding the skins with her plump fingers while he filled them with\r\nmeat and fat. Sometimes, too, with the tips of their tongues they just\r\ntasted the raw sausage-meat, to see if it was properly seasoned. She\r\nwas able to give Quenu some useful hints, for she knew of many\r\nfavourite southern recipes, with which he experimented with much\r\nsuccess. He was often aware that she was standing behind his shoulder,\r\nprying into the pans. If he wanted a spoon or a dish, she would hand it\r\nto him. The heat of the fire would bring their blood to their skins;\r\nstill, nothing in the world would have induced the young man to cease\r\nstirring the fatty _bouillis_ which were thickening over the fire while\r\nthe girl stood gravely by him, discussing the amount of boiling that\r\nwas necessary. In the afternoon, when the shop lacked customers, they\r\nquietly chatted together for hours at a time. Lisa sat behind the\r\ncounter, leaning back, and knitting in an easy, regular fashion; while\r\nQuenu installed himself on a big oak block, dangling his legs and\r\ntapping his heels against the wood. They got on wonderfully well\r\ntogether, discussing all sorts of subjects, generally cookery, and then\r\nUncle Gradelle and the neighbours. Lisa also amused the young man with\r\nstories, just as though he were a child. She knew some very pretty\r\nones\u2014some miraculous legends, full of lambs and little angels, which\r\nshe narrated in a piping voice, with all her wonted seriousness. If a\r\ncustomer happened to come in, she saved herself the trouble of moving\r\nby asking Quenu to get the required pot of lard or box of snails. And\r\nat eleven o\u2019clock they went slowly up to bed as on the previous night.\r\nAs they closed their doors, they calmly repeated the words:\r\n\r\n\u201CGood night, Mademoiselle Lisa.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood night, Monsieur Quenu.\u201D\r\n\r\nOne morning Uncle Gradelle was struck dead by apoplexy while preparing\r\na galantine. He fell forward, with his face against the chopping-block.\r\nLisa did not lose her self-possession. She remarked that the dead man\r\ncould not be left lying in the middle of the kitchen, and had the body\r\nremoved into a little back room where Gradelle had slept. Then she\r\narranged with the assistants what should be said. It must be given out\r\nthat the master had died in his bed; otherwise the whole district would\r\nbe disgusted, and the shop would lose its customers. Quenu helped to\r\ncarry the dead man away, feeling quite confused, and astonished at\r\nbeing unable to shed any tears. Presently, however, he and Lisa cried\r\ntogether. Quenu and his brother Florent were the sole heirs. The\r\ngossips of the neighbourhood credited old Gradelle with the possession\r\nof a considerable fortune. However, not a single crown could be\r\ndiscovered. Lisa seemed very restless and uneasy. Quenu noticed how\r\npensive she became, how she kept on looking around her from morning\r\ntill night, as though she had lost something. At last she decided to\r\nhave a thorough cleaning of the premises, declaring that people were\r\nbeginning to talk, that the story of the old man\u2019s death had got about,\r\nand that it was necessary they should make a great show of cleanliness.\r\nOne afternoon, after remaining in the cellar for a couple of hours,\r\nwhither she herself had gone to wash the salting-tubs, she came up\r\nagain, carrying something in her apron. Quenu was just then cutting up\r\na pig\u2019s fry. She waited till he had finished, talking awhile in an\r\neasy, indifferent fashion. But there was an unusual glitter in her\r\neyes, and she smiled her most charming smile as she told him that she\r\nwanted to speak to him. She led the way upstairs with seeming\r\ndifficulty, impeded by what she had in her apron, which was strained\r\nalmost to bursting.\r\n\r\nBy the time she reached the third floor she found herself short of\r\nbreath, and for a moment was obliged to lean against the balustrade.\r\nQuenu, much astonished, followed her into her bedroom without saying a\r\nword. It was the first time she had ever invited him to enter it. She\r\nclosed the door, and letting go the corners of her apron, which her\r\nstiffened fingers could no longer hold up, she allowed a stream of gold\r\nand silver coins to flow gently upon her bed. She had discovered Uncle\r\nGradelle\u2019s treasure at the bottom of a salting-tub. The heap of money\r\nmade a deep impression in the softy downy bed.\r\n\r\nLisa and Quenu evinced a quiet delight. They sat down on the edge of\r\nthe bed, Lisa at the head and Quenu at the foot, on either side of the\r\nheap of coins, and they counted the money out upon the counterpane, so\r\nas to avoid making any noise. There were forty thousand francs in gold,\r\nand three thousand francs in silver, whilst in a tin box they found\r\nbank notes to the value of forty-two thousand francs. It took them two\r\nhours to count up the treasure. Quenu\u2019s hands trembled slightly, and it\r\nwas Lisa who did most of the work.\r\n\r\nThey arranged the gold on the pillow in little heaps, leaving the\r\nsilver in the hollow depression of the counterpane. When they had\r\nascertained the total amount\u2014eighty-five thousand francs, to them an\r\nenormous sum\u2014they began to chat. And their conversation naturally\r\nturned upon their future, and they spoke of their marriage, although\r\nthere had never been any previous mention of love between them. But\r\nthis heap of money seemed to loosen their tongues. They had gradually\r\nseated themselves further back on the bed, leaning against the wall,\r\nbeneath the white muslin curtains; and as they talked together, their\r\nhands, playing with the heap of silver between them, met, and remained\r\nlinked amidst the pile of five-franc pieces. Twilight surprised them\r\nstill sitting together. Then, for the first time, Lisa blushed at\r\nfinding the young man by her side. For a few moments, indeed, although\r\nnot a thought of evil had come to them, they felt much embarrassed.\r\nThen Lisa went to get her own ten thousand francs. Quenu wanted her to\r\nput them with his uncle\u2019s savings. He mixed the two sums together,\r\nsaying with a laugh that the money must be married also. Then it was\r\nagreed that Lisa should keep the hoard in her chest of drawers. When\r\nshe had locked it up they both quietly went downstairs. They were now\r\npractically husband and wife.\r\n\r\nThe wedding took place during the following month. The neighbours\r\nconsidered the match a very natural one, and in every way suitable.\r\nThey had vaguely heard the story of the treasure, and Lisa\u2019s honesty\r\nwas the subject of endless eulogy. After all, said the gossips, she\r\nmight well have kept the money herself, and not have spoken a word to\r\nQuenu about it; if she had spoken, it was out of pure honesty, for no\r\none had seen her find the hoard. She well deserved, they added, that\r\nQuenu should make her his wife. That Quenu, by the way, was a lucky\r\nfellow; he wasn\u2019t a beauty himself, yet he had secured a beautiful\r\nwife, who had disinterred a fortune for him. Some even went so far as\r\nto whisper that Lisa was a simpleton for having acted as she had done;\r\nbut the young woman only smiled when people speaking to her vaguely\r\nalluded to all these things. She and her husband lived on as\r\npreviously, in happy placidity and quiet affection. She still assisted\r\nhim as before, their hands still met amidst the sausage-meat, she still\r\nglanced over his shoulder into the pots and pans, and still nothing but\r\nthe great fire in the kitchen brought the blood to their cheeks.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lisa was a woman of practical common sense, and speedily saw\r\nthe folly of allowing eighty-five thousand francs to lie idle in a\r\nchest of drawers. Quenu would have willingly stowed them away again at\r\nthe bottom of the salting-tub until he had gained as much more, when\r\nthey could have retired from business and have gone to live at\r\nSuresnes, a suburb to which both were partial. Lisa, however, had other\r\nambitions. The Rue Pirouette did not accord with her ideas of\r\ncleanliness, her craving for fresh air, light, and healthy life. The\r\nshop where Uncle Gradelle had accumulated his fortune, sou by sou, was\r\na long, dark place, one of those suspicious looking pork butchers\u2019\r\nshops of the old quarters of the city, where the well-worn flagstones\r\nretain a strong odour of meat in spite of constant washings. Now the\r\nyoung woman longed for one of those bright modern shops, ornamented\r\nlike a drawing-room, and fringing the footway of some broad street with\r\nwindows of crystalline transparence. She was not actuated by any petty\r\nambition to play the fine lady behind a stylish counter, but clearly\r\nrealised that commerce in its latest development needed elegant\r\nsurroundings. Quenu showed much alarm the first time his wife suggested\r\nthat they ought to move and spend some of their money in decorating a\r\nnew shop. However, Lisa only shrugged her shoulders and smiled at\r\nfinding him so timorous.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when night was falling and the shop had grown dark, Quenu\r\nand Lisa overheard a woman of the neighbourhood talking to a friend\r\noutside their door.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, indeed! I\u2019ve given up dealing with them,\u201D said she. \u201CI wouldn\u2019t\r\nbuy a bit of black-pudding from them now on any account. They had a\r\ndead man in their kitchen, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu wept with vexation. The story of Gradelle\u2019s death in the kitchen\r\nwas clearly getting about; and his nephew began to blush before his\r\ncustomers when he saw them sniffing his wares too closely. So, of his\r\nown accord, he spoke to his wife of her proposal to take a new shop.\r\nLisa, without saying anything, had already been looking out for other\r\npremises, and had found some, admirably situated, only a few yards\r\naway, in the Rue Rambuteau. The immediate neighbourhood of the central\r\nmarkets, which were being opened just opposite, would triple their\r\nbusiness, and make their shop known all over Paris.\r\n\r\nQuenu allowed himself to be drawn into a lavish expenditure of money;\r\nhe laid out over thirty thousand francs in marble, glass, and gilding.\r\nLisa spent hours with the workmen, giving her views about the slightest\r\ndetails. When she was at last installed behind the counter, customers\r\narrived in a perfect procession, merely for the sake of examining the\r\nshop. The inside walls were lined from top to bottom with white marble.\r\nThe ceiling was covered with a huge square mirror, framed by a broad\r\ngilded cornice, richly ornamented, whilst from the centre hung a\r\ncrystal chandelier with four branches. And behind the counter, and on\r\nthe left, and at the far end of the shop were other mirrors, fitted\r\nbetween the marble panels and looking like doors opening into an\r\ninfinite series of brightly lighted halls, where all sorts of\r\nappetising edibles were displayed. The huge counter on the right hand\r\nwas considered a very fine piece of work. At intervals along the front\r\nwere lozenge-shaped panels of pinky marble. The flooring was of tiles,\r\nalternately white and pink, with a deep red fretting as border. The\r\nwhole neighbourhood was proud of the shop, and no one again thought of\r\nreferring to the kitchen in the Rue Pirouette, where a man had died.\r\nFor quite a month women stopped short on the footway to look at Lisa\r\nbetween the saveloys and bladders in the window. Her white and pink\r\nflesh excited as much admiration as the marbles. She seemed to be the\r\nsoul, the living light, the healthy, sturdy idol of the pork trade; and\r\nthenceforth one and all baptised her \u201CLisa the beauty.\u201D\r\n\r\nTo the right of the shop was the dining-room, a neat looking apartment\r\ncontaining a sideboard, a table, and several cane-seated chairs of\r\nlight oak. The matting on the floor, the wallpaper of a soft yellow\r\ntint, the oil-cloth table-cover, coloured to imitate oak, gave the room\r\na somewhat cold appearance, which was relieved only by the glitter of a\r\nbrass hanging lamp, suspended from the ceiling, and spreading its big\r\nshade of transparent porcelain over the table. One of the dining-room\r\ndoors opened into the huge square kitchen, at the end of which was a\r\nsmall paved courtyard, serving for the storage of lumber\u2014tubs, barrels\r\nand pans, and all kinds of utensils not in use. To the left of the\r\nwater-tap, alongside the gutter which carried off the greasy water,\r\nstood pots of faded flowers, removed from the shop window, and slowly\r\ndying.\r\n\r\nBusiness was excellent. Quenu, who had been much alarmed by the initial\r\noutlay, now regarded his wife with something like respect, and told his\r\nfriends that she had \u201Ca wonderful head.\u201D At the end of five years they\r\nhad nearly eighty thousand francs invested in the State funds. Lisa\r\nwould say that they were not ambitious, that they had no desire to pile\r\nup money too quickly, or else she would have enabled her husband to\r\ngain hundreds and thousands of francs by prompting him to embark in the\r\nwholesale pig trade. But they were still young, and had plenty of time\r\nbefore them; besides, they didn\u2019t care about a rough, scrambling\r\nbusiness, but preferred to work at their ease, and enjoy life, instead\r\nof wearing themselves out with endless anxieties.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor instance,\u201D Lisa would add in her expansive moments, \u201CI have, you\r\nknow, a cousin in Paris. I never see him, as the two families have\r\nfallen out. He has taken the name of Saccard,[*] on account of certain\r\nmatters which he wants to be forgotten. Well, this cousin of mine, I\u2019m\r\ntold, makes millions and millions of francs; but he gets no enjoyment\r\nout of life. He\u2019s always in a state of feverish excitement, always\r\nrushing hither and thither, up to his neck in all sorts of worrying\r\nbusiness. Well, it\u2019s impossible, isn\u2019t it, for such a man to eat his\r\ndinner peaceably in the evening? We, at any rate, can take our meals\r\ncomfortably, and make sure of what we eat, and we are not harassed by\r\nworries as he is. The only reason why people should care for money is\r\nthat money\u2019s wanted for one to live. People like comfort; that\u2019s\r\nnatural. But as for making money simply for the sake of making it, and\r\ngiving yourself far more trouble and anxiety to gain it than you can\r\never get pleasure from it when it\u2019s gained, why, as for me, I\u2019d rather\r\nsit still and cross my arms. And besides, I should like to see all\r\nthose millions of my cousin\u2019s. I can\u2019t say that I altogether believe in\r\nthem. I caught sight of him the other day in his carriage. He was quite\r\nyellow, and looked ever so sly. A man who\u2019s making money doesn\u2019t have\r\nthat kind of expression. But it\u2019s his business, and not mine. For our\r\npart, we prefer to make merely a hundred sous at a time, and to get a\r\nhundred sous\u2019 worth of enjoyment out of them.\u201D\r\n\r\n[*] See M. Zola\u2019s novel, _Money_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe household was undoubtedly thriving. A daughter had been born to the\r\nyoung couple during their first year of wedlock, and all three of them\r\nlooked blooming. The business went on prosperously, without any\r\nlaborious fatigue, just as Lisa desired. She had carefully kept free of\r\nany possible source of trouble or anxiety, and the days went by in an\r\natmosphere of peaceful, unctuous prosperity. Their home was a nook of\r\nsensible happiness\u2014a comfortable manger, so to speak, where father,\r\nmother, and daughter could grow sleek and fat. It was only Quenu who\r\noccasionally felt sad, through thinking of his brother Florent. Up to\r\nthe year 1856 he had received letters from him at long intervals. Then\r\nno more came, and he had learned from a newspaper that three convicts\r\nhaving attempted to escape from the \u00CEle du Diable, had been drowned\r\nbefore they were able to reach the mainland. He had made inquiries at\r\nthe Prefecture of Police, but had not learnt anything definite; it\r\nseemed probable that his brother was dead. However, he did not lose all\r\nhope, though months passed without any tidings. Florent, in the\r\nmeantime, was wandering about Dutch Guiana, and refrained from writing\r\nhome as he was ever in hope of being able to return to France. Quenu at\r\nlast began to mourn for him as one mourns for those whom one has been\r\nunable to bid farewell. Lisa had never known Florent, but she spoke\r\nvery kindly whenever she saw her husband give way to his sorrow; and\r\nshe evinced no impatience when for the hundredth time or so he began to\r\nrelate stories of his early days, of his life in the big room in the\r\nRue Royer Collard, the thirty-six trades which he had taken up one\r\nafter another, and the dainties which he had cooked at the stove,\r\ndressed all in white, while Florent was dressed all in black. To such\r\ntalk as this, indeed, she listened placidly, with a complacency which\r\nnever wearied.\r\n\r\nIt was into the midst of all this happiness, ripening after careful\r\nculture, that Florent dropped one September morning just as Lisa was\r\ntaking her matutinal bath of sunshine, and Quenu, with his eyes still\r\nheavy with sleep, was lazily applying his fingers to the congealed fat\r\nleft in the pans from the previous evening. Florent\u2019s arrival caused a\r\ngreat commotion. Gavard advised them to conceal the \u201Coutlaw,\u201D as he\r\nsomewhat pompously called Florent. Lisa, who looked pale, and more\r\nserious than was her wont, at last took him to the fifth floor, where\r\nshe gave him the room belonging to the girl who assisted her in the\r\nshop. Quenu had cut some slices of bread and ham, but Florent was\r\nscarcely able to eat. He was overcome by dizziness and nausea, and went\r\nto bed, where he remained for five days in a state of delirium, the\r\noutcome of an attack of brain-fever, which fortunately received\r\nenergetic treatment. When he recovered consciousness he perceived Lisa\r\nsitting by his bedside, silently stirring some cooling drink in a cup.\r\nAs he tried to thank her, she told him that he must keep perfectly\r\nquiet, and that they could talk together later on. At the end of\r\nanother three days Florent was on his feet again. Then one morning\r\nQuenu went up to tell him that Lisa awaited them in her room on the\r\nfirst floor.\r\n\r\nQuenu and his wife there occupied a suite of three rooms and a\r\ndressing-room. You first passed through an antechamber, containing\r\nnothing but chairs, and then a small sitting-room, whose furniture,\r\nshrouded in white covers, slumbered in the gloom cast by the Venetian\r\nshutters, which were always kept closed so as to prevent the light blue\r\nof the upholstery from fading. Then came the bedroom, the only one of\r\nthe three which was really used. It was very comfortably furnished in\r\nmahogany. The bed, bulky and drowsy of aspect in the depths of the damp\r\nalcove, was really wonderful, with its four mattresses, its four\r\npillows, its layers of blankets, and its corpulent _\u00E9dredon_. It was\r\nevidently a bed intended for slumber. A mirrored wardrobe, a washstand\r\nwith drawers, a small central table with a worked cover, and several\r\nchairs whose seats were protected by squares of lace, gave the room an\r\naspect of plain but substantial middle-class luxury. On the left-hand\r\nwall, on either side of the mantelpiece, which was ornamented with some\r\nlandscape-painted vases mounted on bronze stands, and a gilt timepiece\r\non which a figure of Gutenberg, also gilt, stood in an attitude of deep\r\nthought, hung portraits in oils of Quenu and Lisa, in ornate oval\r\nframes. Quenu had a smiling face, while Lisa wore an air of grave\r\npropriety; and both were dressed in black and depicted in flattering\r\nfashion, their features idealised, their skins wondrously smooth, their\r\ncomplexions soft and pinky. A carpet, in the Wilton style, with a\r\ncomplicated pattern of roses mingling with stars, concealed the\r\nflooring; while in front of the bed was a fluffy mat, made out of long\r\npieces of curly wool, a work of patience at which Lisa herself had\r\ntoiled while seated behind her counter. But the most striking object of\r\nall in the midst of this array of new furniture was a great square,\r\nthick-set secr\u00E9taire, which had been re-polished in vain, for the\r\ncracks and notches in the marble top and the scratches on the old\r\nmahogany front, quite black with age, still showed plainly. Lisa had\r\ndesired to retain this piece of furniture, however, as Uncle Gradelle\r\nhad used it for more than forty years. It would bring them good luck,\r\nshe said. It\u2019s metal fastenings were truly something terrible, it\u2019s\r\nlock was like that of a prison gate, and it was so heavy that it could\r\nscarcely be moved.\r\n\r\nWhen Florent and Quenu entered the room they found Lisa seated at the\r\nlowered desk of the secr\u00E9taire, writing and putting down figures in a\r\nbig, round, and very legible hand. She signed to them not to disturb\r\nher, and the two men sat down. Florent looked round the room, and\r\nnotably at the two portraits, the bed and the timepiece, with an air of\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere!\u201D at last exclaimed Lisa, after having carefully verified a\r\nwhole page of calculations. \u201CListen to me now; we have an account to\r\nrender to you, my dear Florent.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that she had so addressed him. However, taking up\r\nthe page of figures, she continued: \u201CYour Uncle Gradelle died without\r\nleaving a will. Consequently you and your brother are his sole heirs.\r\nWe now have to hand your share over to you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I do not ask you for anything!\u201D exclaimed Florent, \u201CI don\u2019t wish\r\nfor anything!\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu had apparently been in ignorance of his wife\u2019s intentions. He\r\nturned rather pale and looked at her with an expression of displeasure.\r\nOf course, he certainly loved his brother dearly; but there was no\r\noccasion to hurl his uncle\u2019s money at him in this way. There would have\r\nbeen plenty of time to go into the matter later on.\r\n\r\n\u201CI know very well, my dear Florent,\u201D continued Lisa, \u201Cthat you did not\r\ncome back with the intention of claiming from us what belongs to you;\r\nbut business is business, you know, and we had better get things\r\nsettled at once. Your uncle\u2019s savings amounted to eighty-five thousand\r\nfrancs. I have therefore put down forty-two thousand five hundred to\r\nyour credit. See!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe showed him the figures on the sheet of paper.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is unfortunately not so easy to value the shop, plant,\r\nstock-in-trade, and goodwill. I have only been able to put down\r\napproximate amounts, but I don\u2019t think I have underestimated anything.\r\nWell, the total valuation which I have made comes to fifteen thousand\r\nthree hundred and ten francs; your half of which is seven thousand six\r\nhundred and fifty-five francs, so that your share amounts, in all, to\r\nfifty thousand one hundred and fifty-five francs. Please verify it for\r\nyourself, will you?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe had called out the figures in a clear, distinct voice, and she now\r\nhanded the paper to Florent, who was obliged to take it.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut the old man\u2019s business was certainly never worth fifteen thousand\r\nfrancs!\u201D cried Quenu. \u201CWhy, I wouldn\u2019t have given ten thousand for it!\u201D\r\n\r\nHe had ended by getting quite angry with his wife. Really, it was\r\nabsurd to carry honesty to such a point as that! Had Florent said one\r\nword about the business? No, indeed, he had declared that he didn\u2019t\r\nwish for anything.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe business was worth fifteen thousand three hundred and ten francs,\u201D\r\nLisa re-asserted, calmly. \u201CYou will agree with me, my dear Florent,\r\nthat it is quite unnecessary to bring a lawyer into our affairs. It is\r\nfor us to arrange the division between ourselves, since you have now\r\nturned up again. I naturally thought of this as soon as you arrived;\r\nand, while you were in bed with the fever, I did my best to draw up\r\nthis little inventory. It contains, as you see, a fairly complete\r\nstatement of everything. I have been through our old books, and have\r\ncalled up my memory to help me. Read it aloud, and I will give you any\r\nadditional information you may want.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent ended by smiling. He was touched by this easy and, as it were,\r\nnatural display of probity. Placing the sheet of figures on the young\r\nwoman\u2019s knee, he took hold of her hand and said, \u201CI am very glad, my\r\ndear Lisa, to hear that you are prosperous, but I will not take your\r\nmoney. The heritage belongs to you and my brother, who took care of my\r\nuncle up to the last. I don\u2019t require anything, and I don\u2019t intend to\r\nhamper you in carrying on your business.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa insisted, and even showed some vexation, while Quenu gnawed his\r\nthumbs in silence to restrain himself.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D resumed Florent with a laugh, \u201Cif Uncle Gradelle could hear you,\r\nI think he\u2019d come back and take the money away again. I was never a\r\nfavourite of his, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, no,\u201D muttered Quenu, no longer able to keep still, \u201Che certainly\r\nwasn\u2019t over fond of you.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa, however, still pressed the matter. She did not like to have money\r\nin her secr\u00E9taire that did not belong to her; it would worry her, said\r\nshe; the thought of it would disturb her peace. Thereupon Florent,\r\nstill in a joking way, proposed to invest his share in the business.\r\nMoreover, said he, he did not intend to refuse their help; he would, no\r\ndoubt, be unable to find employment all at once; and then, too, he\r\nwould need a complete outfit, for he was scarcely presentable.\r\n\r\n\u201COf course,\u201D cried Quenu, \u201Cyou will board and lodge with us, and we\r\nwill buy you all that you want. That\u2019s understood. You know very well\r\nthat we are not likely to leave you in the streets, I hope!\u201D\r\n\r\nHe was quite moved now, and even felt a trifle ashamed of the alarm he\r\nhad experienced at the thought of having to hand over a large amount of\r\nmoney all at once. He began to joke, and told his brother that he would\r\nundertake to fatten him. Florent gently shook his hand; while Lisa\r\nfolded up the sheet of figures and put it away in a drawer of the\r\nsecr\u00E9taire.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are wrong,\u201D she said by way of conclusion. \u201CI have done what I was\r\nbound to do. Now it shall be as you wish. But, for my part, I should\r\nnever have had a moment\u2019s peace if I had not put things before you. Bad\r\nthoughts would quite upset me.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey then began to speak of another matter. It would be necessary to\r\ngive some reason for Florent\u2019s presence, and at the same time avoid\r\nexciting the suspicion of the police. He told them that in order to\r\nreturn to France he had availed himself of the papers of a poor fellow\r\nwho had died in his arms at Surinam from yellow fever. By a singular\r\ncoincidence this young fellow\u2019s Christian name was Florent.\r\n\r\nFlorent Laquerriere, to give him his name in full, had left but one\r\nrelation in Paris, a female cousin, and had been informed of her death\r\nwhile in America. Nothing could therefore be easier than for Quenu\u2019s\r\nhalf brother to pass himself off as the man who had died at Surinam.\r\nLisa offered to take upon herself the part of the female cousin. They\r\nthen agreed to relate that their cousin Florent had returned from\r\nabroad, where he had failed in his attempts to make a fortune, and that\r\nthey, the Quenu-Gradelles, as they were called in the neighbourhood,\r\nhad received him into their house until he could find suitable\r\nemployment. When this was all settled, Quenu insisted upon his brother\r\nmaking a thorough inspection of the rooms, and would not spare him the\r\nexamination of a single stool. Whilst they were in the bare looking\r\nchamber containing nothing but chairs, Lisa pushed open a door, and\r\nshowing Florent a small dressing room, told him that the shop girl\r\nshould sleep in it, so that he could retain the bedroom on the fifth\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Florent was arrayed in new clothes from head to foot. He\r\nhad insisted upon again having a black coat and black trousers, much\r\nagainst the advice of Quenu, upon whom black had a depressing effect.\r\nNo further attempts were made to conceal his presence in the house, and\r\nLisa told the story which had been planned to everyone who cared to\r\nhear it. Henceforth Florent spent almost all his time on the premises,\r\nlingering on a chair in the kitchen or leaning against the marble-work\r\nin the shop. At meal times Quenu plied him with food, and evinced\r\nconsiderable vexation when he proved such a small eater and left half\r\nthe contents of his liberally filled plate untouched. Lisa had resumed\r\nher old life, evincing a kindly tolerance of her brother-in-law\u2019s\r\npresence, even in the morning, when he somewhat interfered with the\r\nwork. Then she would momentarily forget him, and on suddenly perceiving\r\nhis black form in front of her give a slight start of surprise,\r\nfollowed, however, by one of her sweet smiles, lest he might feel at\r\nall hurt. This skinny man\u2019s disinterestedness had impressed her, and\r\nshe regarded him with a feeling akin to respect, mingled with vague\r\nfear. Florent had for his part only felt that there was great affection\r\naround him.\r\n\r\nWhen bedtime came he went upstairs, a little wearied by his lazy day,\r\nwith the two young men whom Quenu employed as assistants, and who slept\r\nin attics adjoining his own. Leon, the apprentice, was barely fifteen\r\nyears of age. He was a slight, gentle looking lad, addicted to stealing\r\nstray slices of ham and bits of sausages. These he would conceal under\r\nhis pillow, eating them during the night without any bread. Several\r\ntimes at about one o\u2019clock in the morning Florent almost fancied that\r\nLeon was giving a supper-party; for he heard low whispering followed by\r\na sound of munching jaws and rustling paper. And then a rippling\r\ngirlish laugh would break faintly on the deep silence of the sleeping\r\nhouse like the soft trilling of a flageolet.\r\n\r\nThe other assistant, Auguste Landois, came from Troyes. Bloated with\r\nunhealthy fat, he had too large a head, and was already bald, although\r\nonly twenty-eight years of age. As he went upstairs with Florent on the\r\nfirst evening, he told him his story in a confused, garrulous way. He\r\nhad at first come to Paris merely for the purpose of perfecting himself\r\nin the business, intending to return to Troyes, where his cousin,\r\nAugustine Landois, was waiting for him, and there setting up for\r\nhimself as a pork butcher. He and she had had the same godfather and\r\nbore virtually the same Christian name. However, he had grown\r\nambitious; and now hoped to establish himself in business in Paris by\r\nthe aid of the money left him by his mother, which he had deposited\r\nwith a notary before leaving Champagne.\r\n\r\nAuguste had got so far in his narrative when the fifth floor was\r\nreached; however, he still detained Florent, in order to sound the\r\npraises of Madame Quenu, who had consented to send for Augustine\r\nLandois to replace an assistant who had turned out badly. He himself\r\nwas now thoroughly acquainted with his part of the business, and his\r\ncousin was perfecting herself in shop management. In a year or eighteen\r\nmonths they would be married, and then they would set up on their own\r\naccount in some populous corner of Paris, at Plaisance most likely.\r\nThey were in no great hurry, he added, for the bacon trade was very bad\r\nthat year. Then he proceeded to tell Florent that he and his cousin had\r\nbeen photographed together at the fair of St. Ouen, and he entered the\r\nattic to have another look at the photograph, which Augustine had left\r\non the mantelpiece, in her desire that Madame Quenu\u2019s cousin should\r\nhave a pretty room. Auguste lingered there for a moment, looking quite\r\nlivid in the dim yellow light of his candle, and casting his eyes\r\naround the little chamber which was still full of memorials of the\r\nyoung girl. Next, stepping up to the bed, he asked Florent if it was\r\ncomfortable. His cousin slept below now, said he, and would be better\r\nthere in the winter, for the attics were very cold. Then at last he\r\nwent off, leaving Florent alone with the bed, and standing in front of\r\nthe photograph. As shown on the latter Auguste looked like a sort of\r\npale Quenu, and Augustine like an immature Lisa.\r\n\r\nFlorent, although on friendly terms with the assistants, petted by his\r\nbrother, and cordially treated by Lisa, presently began to feel very\r\nbored. He had tried, but without success, to obtain some pupils;\r\nmoreover, he purposely avoided the students\u2019 quarter for fear of being\r\nrecognised. Lisa gently suggested to him that he had better try to\r\nobtain a situation in some commercial house, where he could take charge\r\nof the correspondence and keep the books. She returned to this subject\r\nagain and again, and at last offered to find a berth for him herself.\r\nShe was gradually becoming impatient at finding him so often in her\r\nway, idle, and not knowing what to do with himself. At first this\r\nimpatience was merely due to the dislike she felt of people who do\r\nnothing but cross their arms and eat, and she had no thought of\r\nreproaching him for consuming her substance.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor my own part,\u201D she would say to him, \u201CI could never spend the whole\r\nday in dreamy lounging. You can\u2019t have any appetite for your meals. You\r\nought to tire yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\nGavard, also, was seeking a situation for Florent, but in a very\r\nextraordinary and most mysterious fashion. He would have liked to find\r\nsome employment of a dramatic character, or in which there should be a\r\ntouch of bitter irony, as was suitable for an outlaw. Gavard was a man\r\nwho was always in opposition. He had just completed his fiftieth year,\r\nand he boasted that he had already passed judgment on four Governments.\r\nHe still contemptuously shrugged his shoulders at the thought of\r\nCharles X, the priests and nobles and other attendant rabble, whom he\r\nhad helped to sweep away. Louis Philippe, with his bourgeois following,\r\nhad been an imbecile, and he could tell how the citizen-king had\r\nhoarded his coppers in a woollen stocking. As for the Republic of \u201848,\r\nthat had been a mere farce, the working classes had deceived him;\r\nhowever, he no longer acknowledged that he had applauded the Coup\r\nd\u2019Etat, for he now looked upon Napoleon III as his personal enemy, a\r\nscoundrel who shut himself up with Morny and others to indulge in\r\ngluttonous orgies. He was never weary of holding forth upon this\r\nsubject. Lowering his voice a little, he would declare that women were\r\nbrought to the Tuileries in closed carriages every evening, and that\r\nhe, who was speaking, had one night heard the echoes of the orgies\r\nwhile crossing the Place du Carrousel. It was Gavard\u2019s religion to make\r\nhimself as disagreeable as possible to any existing Government. He\r\nwould seek to spite it in all sorts of ways, and laugh in secret for\r\nseveral months at the pranks he played. To begin with, he voted for\r\ncandidates who would worry the Ministers at the Corps L\u00E9gislatif. Then,\r\nif he could rob the revenue, or baffle the police, and bring about a\r\nrow of some kind or other, he strove to give the affair as much of an\r\ninsurrectionary character as possible. He told a great many lies, too;\r\nset himself up as being a very dangerous man; talked as though \u201Cthe\r\nsatellites of the Tuileries\u201D were well acquainted with him and trembled\r\nat the sight of him; and asserted that one half of them must be\r\nguillotined, and the other half transported, the next time there was \u201Ca\r\nflare-up.\u201D His violent political creed found food in boastful, bragging\r\ntalk of this sort; he displayed all the partiality for a lark and a\r\nrumpus which prompts a Parisian shopkeeper to take down his shutters on\r\na day of barricade-fighting to get a good view of the corpses of the\r\nslain. When Florent returned from Cayenne, Gavard opined that he had\r\ngot hold of a splendid chance for some abominable trick, and bestowed\r\nmuch thought upon the question of how he might best vent his spleen on\r\nthe Emperor and Ministers and everyone in office, down to the very\r\nlowest police constable.\r\n\r\nGavard\u2019s manners with Florent were altogether those of a man tasting\r\nsome forbidden pleasure. He contemplated him with blinking eyes,\r\nlowered his voice even when making the most trifling remark, and\r\ngrasped his hand with all sorts of masonic flummery. He had at last\r\nlighted upon something in the way of an adventure; he had a friend who\r\nwas really compromised, and could, without falsehood speak of the\r\ndangers he incurred. He undoubtedly experienced a secret alarm at the\r\nsight of this man who had returned from transportation, and whose\r\nfleshlessness testified to the long sufferings he had endured; however,\r\nthis touch of alarm was delightful, for it increased his notion of his\r\nown importance, and convinced him that he was really doing something\r\nwonderful in treating a dangerous character as a friend. Florent became\r\na sort of sacred being in his eyes: he swore by him alone, and had\r\nrecourse to his name whenever arguments failed him and he wanted to\r\ncrush the Government once and for all.\r\n\r\nGavard had lost his wife in the Rue Saint Jacques some months after the\r\nCoup d\u2019Etat; however, he had kept on his roasting shop till 1856. At\r\nthat time it was reported that he had made large sums of money by going\r\ninto partnership with a neighbouring grocer who had obtained a contract\r\nfor supplying dried vegetables to the Crimean expeditionary corps. The\r\ntruth was, however, that, having sold his shop, he lived on his income\r\nfor a year without doing anything. He himself did not care to talk\r\nabout the real origin of his fortune, for to have revealed it would\r\nhave prevented him from plainly expressing his opinion of the Crimean\r\nWar, which he referred to as a mere adventurous expedition, \u201Cundertaken\r\nsimply to consolidate the throne and to fill certain persons\u2019 pockets.\u201D\r\nAt the end of a year he had grown utterly weary of life in his bachelor\r\nquarters. As he was in the habit of visiting the Quenu-Gradelles almost\r\ndaily, he determined to take up his residence nearer to them, and came\r\nto live in the Rue de la Cossonnerie. The neighbouring markets, with\r\ntheir noisy uproar and endless chatter, quite fascinated him; and he\r\ndecided to hire a stall in the poultry pavilion, just for the purpose\r\nof amusing himself and occupying his idle hours with all the gossip.\r\nThenceforth he lived amidst ceaseless tittle-tattle, acquainted with\r\nevery little scandal in the neighbourhood, his head buzzing with the\r\nincessant yelping around him. He blissfully tasted a thousand\r\ntitillating delights, having at last found his true element, and\r\nbathing in it, with the voluptuous pleasure of a carp swimming in the\r\nsunshine. Florent would sometimes go to see him at his stall. The\r\nafternoons were still very warm. All along the narrow alleys sat women\r\nplucking poultry. Rays of light streamed in between the awnings, and in\r\nthe warm atmosphere, in the golden dust of the sunbeams, feathers\r\nfluttered hither and thither like dancing snowflakes. A trail of\r\ncoaxing calls and offers followed Florent as he passed along. \u201CCan I\r\nsell you a fine duck, monsieur?\u201D \u201CI\u2019ve some very fine fat chickens\r\nhere, monsieur; come and see!\u201D \u201CMonsieur! monsieur, do just buy this\r\npair of pigeons!\u201D Deafened and embarrassed he freed himself from the\r\nwomen, who still went on plucking as they fought for possession of him;\r\nand the fine down flew about and wellnigh choked him, like hot smoke\r\nreeking with the strong odour of the poultry. At last, in the middle of\r\nthe alley, near the water-taps, he found Gavard ranting away in his\r\nshirt-sleeves, in front of his stall, with his arms crossed over the\r\nbib of his blue apron. He reigned there, in a gracious, condescending\r\nway, over a group of ten or twelve women. He was the only male dealer\r\nin that part of the market. He was so fond of wagging his tongue that\r\nhe had quarrelled with five or six girls whom he had successively\r\nengaged to attend to his stall, and had now made up his mind to sell\r\nhis goods himself, naively explaining that the silly women spent the\r\nwhole blessed day in gossiping, and that it was beyond his power to\r\nmanage them. As someone, however, was still necessary to supply his\r\nplace whenever he absented himself he took in Marjolin, who was\r\nprowling about, after attempting in turn all the petty market callings.\r\n\r\nFlorent sometimes remained for an hour with Gavard, amazed by his\r\nceaseless flow of chatter, and his calm serenity and assurance amid the\r\ncrowd of petticoats. He would interrupt one woman, pick a quarrel with\r\nanother ten stalls away, snatch a customer from a third, and make as\r\nmuch noise himself as his hundred and odd garrulous neighbours, whose\r\nincessant clamour kept the iron plates of the pavilion vibrating\r\nsonorously like so many gongs.\r\n\r\nThe poultry dealer\u2019s only relations were a sister-in-law and a niece.\r\nWhen his wife died, her eldest sister, Madame Lec\u0153ur, who had become a\r\nwidow about a year previously, had mourned for her in an exaggerated\r\nfashion, and gone almost every evening to tender consolation to the\r\nbereaved husband. She had doubtless cherished the hope that she might\r\nwin his affection and fill the yet warm place of the deceased. Gavard,\r\nhowever, abominated lean women; and would, indeed, only stroke such\r\ncats and dogs as were very fat; so that Madame Lec\u0153ur, who was long and\r\nwithered, failed in her designs.\r\n\r\nWith her feelings greatly hurt, furious at the ex-roaster\u2019s five-franc\r\npieces eluding her grasp, she nurtured great spite against him. He\r\nbecame the enemy to whom she devoted all her time. When she saw him set\r\nup in the markets only a few yards away from the pavilion where she\r\nherself sold butter and eggs and cheese, she accused him of doing so\r\nsimply for the sake of annoying her and bringing her bad luck. From\r\nthat moment she began to lament, and turned so yellow and melancholy\r\nthat she indeed ended by losing her customers and getting into\r\ndifficulties. She had for a long time kept with her the daughter of one\r\nof her sisters, a peasant woman who had sent her the child and then\r\ntaken no further trouble about it.\r\n\r\nThis child grew up in the markets. Her surname was Sarriet, and so she\r\nsoon became generally known as La Sarriette. At sixteen years of age\r\nshe had developed into such a charming sly-looking puss that gentlemen\r\ncame to buy cheeses at her aunt\u2019s stall simply for the purpose of\r\nogling her. She did not care for the gentlemen, however; with her dark\r\nhair, pale face, and eyes glistening like live embers, her sympathies\r\nwere with the lower ranks of the people. At last she chose as her lover\r\na young man from Menilmontant who was employed by her aunt as a porter.\r\nAt twenty she set up in business as a fruit dealer with the help of\r\nsome funds procured no one knew how; and thenceforth Monsieur Jules, as\r\nher lover was called, displayed spotless hands, a clean blouse, and a\r\nvelvet cap; and only came down to the market in the afternoon, in his\r\nslippers. They lived together on the third storey of a large house in\r\nthe Rue Vauvilliers, on the ground floor of which was a disreputable\r\ncaf\u00E9.\r\n\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur\u2019s acerbity of temper was brought to a pitch by what she\r\ncalled La Sarriette\u2019s ingratitude, and she spoke of the girl in the\r\nmost violent and abusive language. They broke off all intercourse, the\r\naunt fairly exasperated, and the niece and Monsieur Jules concocting\r\nstories about the aunt, which the young man would repeat to the other\r\ndealers in the butter pavilion. Gavard found La Sarriette very\r\nentertaining, and treated her with great indulgence. Whenever they met\r\nhe would good-naturedly pat her cheeks.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, whilst Florent was sitting in his brother\u2019s shop, tired\r\nout with the fruitless pilgrimages he had made during the morning in\r\nsearch of work, Marjolin made his appearance there. This big lad, who\r\nhad the massiveness and gentleness of a Fleming, was a protege of\r\nLisa\u2019s. She would say that there was no evil in him; that he was indeed\r\na little bit stupid, but as strong as a horse, and particularly\r\ninteresting from the fact that nobody knew anything of his parentage.\r\nIt was she who had got Gavard to employ him.\r\n\r\nLisa was sitting behind the counter, feeling annoyed by the sight of\r\nFlorent\u2019s muddy boots which were soiling the pink and white tiles of\r\nthe flooring. Twice already had she risen to scatter sawdust about the\r\nshop. However, she smiled at Marjolin as he entered.\r\n\r\n\u201CMonsieur Gavard,\u201D began the young man, \u201Chas sent me to ask\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nBut all at once he stopped and glanced round; then in a lower voice he\r\nresumed: \u201CHe told me to wait till there was no one with you, and then\r\nto repeat these words, which he made me learn by heart: \u2018Ask them if\r\nthere is no danger, and if I can come and talk to them of the matter\r\nthey know about.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTell Monsieur Gavard that we are expecting him,\u201D replied Lisa, who was\r\nquite accustomed to the poultry dealer\u2019s mysterious ways.\r\n\r\nMarjolin, however, did not go away; but remained in ecstasy before the\r\nhandsome mistress of the shop, contemplating her with an expression of\r\nfawning humility.\r\n\r\nTouched, as it were, by this mute adoration, Lisa spoke to him again.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you comfortable with Monsieur Gavard?\u201D she asked. \u201CHe\u2019s not an\r\nunkind man, and you ought to try to please him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, Madame Lisa.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you don\u2019t behave as you should, you know. Only yesterday I saw you\r\nclambering about the roofs of the market again; and, besides, you are\r\nconstantly with a lot of disreputable lads and lasses. You ought to\r\nremember that you are a man now, and begin to think of the future.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, Madame Lisa.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, Lisa had to get up to wait upon a lady who came in and wanted\r\na pound of pork chops. She left the counter and went to the block at\r\nthe far end of the shop. Here, with a long, slender knife, she cut\r\nthree chops in a loin of pork; and then, raising a small cleaver with\r\nher strong hand, dealt three sharp blows which separated the chops from\r\nthe loin. At each blow she dealt, her black merino dress rose slightly\r\nbehind her, and the ribs of her stays showed beneath her tightly\r\nstretched bodice. She slowly took up the chops and weighed them with an\r\nair of gravity, her eyes gleaming and her lips tightly closed.\r\n\r\nWhen the lady had gone, and Lisa perceived Marjolin still full of\r\ndelight at having seen her deal those three clean, forcible blows with\r\nthe cleaver, she at once called out to him, \u201CWhat! haven\u2019t you gone\r\nyet?\u201D\r\n\r\nHe thereupon turned to go, but she detained him for a moment longer.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, don\u2019t let me see you again with that hussy Cadine,\u201D she said.\r\n\u201COh, it\u2019s no use to deny it! I saw you together this morning in the\r\ntripe market, watching men breaking the sheep\u2019s heads. I can\u2019t\r\nunderstand what attraction a good-looking young fellow like you can\r\nfind in such a slipshod slattern as Cadine. Now then, go and tell\r\nMonsieur Gavard that he had better come at once, while there\u2019s no one\r\nabout.\u201D\r\n\r\nMarjolin thereupon went off in confusion, without saying a word.\r\n\r\nHandsome Lisa remained standing behind her counter, with her head\r\nturned slightly in the direction of her markets, and Florent gazed at\r\nher in silence, surprised to see her looking so beautiful. He had never\r\nlooked at her properly before; indeed, he did not know the right way to\r\nlook at a woman. He now saw her rising above the viands on the counter.\r\nIn front of her was an array of white china dishes, containing long\r\nArles and Lyons sausages, slices of which had already been cut off,\r\nwith tongues and pieces of boiled pork; then a pig\u2019s head in a mass of\r\njelly; an open pot of preserved sausage-meat, and a large box of\r\nsardines disclosing a pool of oil. On the right and left, upon wooden\r\nplatters, were mounds of French and Italian brawn, a common French ham,\r\nof a pinky hue, and a Yorkshire ham, whose deep red lean showed beneath\r\na broad band of fat. There were other dishes too, round ones and oval\r\nones, containing spiced tongue, truffled galantine, and a boar\u2019s head\r\nstuffed with pistachio nuts; while close to her, in reach of her hand,\r\nstood some yellow earthen pans containing larded veal, _pat\u00E9 de foie\r\ngras_, and hare-pie.\r\n\r\nAs there were no signs of Gavard\u2019s coming, she arranged some fore-end\r\nbacon upon a little marble shelf at the end of the counter, put the\r\njars of lard and dripping back into their places, wiped the plates of\r\neach pair of scales, and saw to the fire of the heater, which was\r\ngetting low. Then she turned her head again, and gazed in silence\r\ntowards the markets. The smell of all the viands ascended around her,\r\nshe was enveloped, as it were, by the aroma of truffles. She looked\r\nbeautifully fresh that afternoon. The whiteness of all the dishes was\r\nsupplemented by that of her sleevelets and apron, above which appeared\r\nher plump neck and rosy cheeks, which recalled the soft tones of the\r\nhams and the pallor of all the transparent fat.\r\n\r\nAs Florent continued to gaze at her he began to feel intimidated,\r\ndisquieted by her prim, sedate demeanour; and in lieu of openly looking\r\nat her he ended by glancing surreptitiously in the mirrors around the\r\nshop, in which her back and face and profile could be seen. The mirror\r\non the ceiling, too, reflected the top of her head, with its tightly\r\nrolled chignon and the little bands lowered over her temples. There\r\nseemed, indeed, to be a perfect crowd of Lisas, with broad shoulders,\r\npowerful arms, and round, full bosoms. At last Florent checked his\r\nroving eyes, and let them rest on a particularly pleasing side view of\r\nthe young woman as mirrored between two pieces of pork. From the hooks\r\nrunning along the whole line of mirrors and marbles hung sides of pork\r\nand bands of larding fat; and Lisa, with her massive neck, rounded\r\nhips, and swelling bosom seen in profile, looked like some waxwork\r\nqueen in the midst of the dangling fat and meat. However, she bent\r\nforward and smiled in a friendly way at the two gold-fish which were\r\never and ever swimming round the aquarium in the window.\r\n\r\nGavard entered the shop. With an air of great importance he went to\r\nfetch Quenu from the kitchen. Then he seated himself upon a small\r\nmarble-topped table, while Florent remained on his chair and Lisa\r\nbehind the counter; Quenu meantime leaning his back against a side of\r\npork. And thereupon Gavard announced that he had at last found a\r\nsituation for Florent. They would be vastly amused when they heard what\r\nit was, and the Government would be nicely caught.\r\n\r\nBut all at once he stopped short, for a passing neighbour, Mademoiselle\r\nSaget, having seen such a large party gossiping together at the\r\nQuenu-Gradelles\u2019, had opened the door and entered the shop. Carrying\r\nher everlasting black ribbonless straw hat, which appropriately cast a\r\nshadow over her prying white face, she saluted the men with a slight\r\nbow and Lisa with a sharp smile.\r\n\r\nShe was an acquaintance of the family, and still lived in the house in\r\nthe Rue Pirouette where she had resided for the last forty years,\r\nprobably on a small private income; but of that she never spoke. She\r\nhad, however, one day talked of Cherbourg, mentioning that she had been\r\nborn there. Nothing further was ever known of her antecedents. All her\r\nconversation was about other people; she could tell the whole story of\r\ntheir daily lives, even to the number of things they sent to be washed\r\neach month; and she carried her prying curiosity concerning her\r\nneighbours\u2019 affairs so far as to listen behind their doors and open\r\ntheir letters. Her tongue was feared from the Rue Saint Denis to the\r\nRue Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and from the Rue Saint Honor\u00E9 to the Rue\r\nMauconseil. All day long she went ferreting about with her empty bag,\r\npretending that she was marketing, but in reality buying nothing, as\r\nher sole purpose was to retail scandal and gossip, and keep herself\r\nfully informed of every trifling incident that happened. Indeed, she\r\nhad turned her brain into an encyclopaedia brimful of every possible\r\nparticular concerning the people of the neighbourhood and their homes.\r\n\r\nQuenu had always accused her of having spread the story of his Uncle\r\nGradelle\u2019s death on the chopping-block, and had borne her a grudge ever\r\nsince. She was extremely well posted in the history of Uncle Gradelle\r\nand the Quenus, and knew them, she would say, by heart. For the last\r\nfortnight, however, Florent\u2019s arrival had greatly perplexed her, filled\r\nher, indeed, with a perfect fever of curiosity. She became quite ill\r\nwhen she discovered any unforeseen gap in her information. And yet she\r\ncould have sworn that she had seen that tall lanky fellow somewhere or\r\nother before.\r\n\r\nShe remained standing in front of the counter, examining the dishes one\r\nafter another, and saying in a shrill voice:\r\n\r\n\u201CI hardly know what to have. When the afternoon comes I feel quite\r\nfamished for my dinner, and then, later on, I don\u2019t seem able to fancy\r\nanything at all. Have you got a cutlet rolled in bread-crumbs left,\r\nMadame Quenu?\u201D\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for a reply, she removed one of the covers of the\r\nheater. It was that of the compartment reserved for the chitterlings,\r\nsausages, and black-puddings. However, the chafing-dish was quite cold,\r\nand there was nothing left but one stray forgotten sausage.\r\n\r\n\u201CLook under the other cover, Mademoiselle Saget,\u201D said Lisa. \u201CI believe\r\nthere\u2019s a cutlet there.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, it doesn\u2019t tempt me,\u201D muttered the little old woman, poking her\r\nnose under the other cover, however, all the same. \u201CI felt rather a\r\nfancy for one, but I\u2019m afraid a cutlet would be rather too heavy in the\r\nevening. I\u2019d rather have something, too, that I need not warm.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhile speaking she had turned towards Florent and looked at him; then\r\nshe looked at Gavard, who was beating a tattoo with his finger-tips on\r\nthe marble table. She smiled at them, as though inviting them to\r\ncontinue their conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201CWouldn\u2019t a little piece of salt pork suit you?\u201D asked Lisa.\r\n\r\n\u201CA piece of salt pork? Yes, that might do.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon she took up the fork with plated handle, which was lying at\r\nthe edge of the dish, and began to turn all the pieces of pork about,\r\nprodding them, lightly tapping the bones to judge of their thickness,\r\nand minutely scrutinising the shreds of pinky meat. And as she turned\r\nthem over she repeated, \u201CNo, no; it doesn\u2019t tempt me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, then, have a sheep\u2019s tongue, or a bit of brawn, or a slice of\r\nlarded veal,\u201D suggested Lisa patiently.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget, however, shook her head. She remained there for a\r\nfew minutes longer, pulling dissatisfied faces over the different\r\ndishes; then, seeing that the others were determined to remain silent,\r\nand that she would not be able to learn anything, she took herself off.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; I rather felt a fancy for a cutlet rolled in bread-crumbs,\u201D she\r\nsaid as she left the shop, \u201Cbut the one you have left is too fat. I\r\nmust come another time.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa bent forward to watch her through the sausage-skins hanging in the\r\nshop-front, and saw her cross the road and enter the fruit market.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe old she-goat!\u201D growled Gavard.\r\n\r\nThen, as they were now alone again, he began to tell them of the\r\nsituation he had found for Florent. A friend of his, he said, Monsieur\r\nVerlaque, one of the fish market inspectors, was so ill that he was\r\nobliged to take a rest; and that very morning the poor man had told him\r\nthat he should be very glad to find a substitute who would keep his\r\nberth open for him in case he should recover.\r\n\r\n\u201CVerlaque, you know, won\u2019t last another six months,\u201D added Gavard, \u201Cand\r\nFlorent will keep the place. It\u2019s a splendid idea, isn\u2019t it? And it\r\nwill be such a take-in for the police! The berth is under the\r\nPrefecture, you know. What glorious fun to see Florent getting paid by\r\nthe police, eh?\u201D\r\n\r\nHe burst into a hearty laugh; the idea struck him as so extremely\r\ncomical.\r\n\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t take the place,\u201D Florent bluntly replied. \u201CI\u2019ve sworn I\u2019ll\r\nnever accept anything from the Empire, and I would rather die of\r\nstarvation than serve under the Prefecture. It is quite out of the\r\nquestion, Gavard, quite so!\u201D\r\n\r\nGavard seemed somewhat put out on hearing this. Quenu had lowered his\r\nhead, while Lisa, turning round, looked keenly at Florent, her neck\r\nswollen, her bosom straining her bodice almost to bursting point. She\r\nwas just going to open her mouth when La Sarriette entered the shop,\r\nand there was another pause in the conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201CDear me!\u201D exclaimed La Sarriette with her soft laugh, \u201CI\u2019d almost\r\nforgotten to get any bacon fat. Please, Madame Quenu, cut me a dozen\r\nthin strips\u2014very thin ones, you know; I want them for larding larks.\r\nJules has taken it into his head to eat some larks. Ah! how do you do,\r\nuncle?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe filled the whole shop with her dancing skirts and smiled brightly\r\nat everyone. Her face looked fresh and creamy, and on one side her hair\r\nwas coming down, loosened by the wind which blew through the markets.\r\nGavard grasped her hands, while she with merry impudence resumed: \u201CI\u2019ll\r\nbet that you were talking about me just as I came in. Tell me what you\r\nwere saying, uncle.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, Lisa now called to her, \u201CJust look and tell me if this is thin\r\nenough.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was cutting the strips of bacon fat with great care on a piece of\r\nboard in front of her. Then as she wrapped them up she inquired, \u201CCan I\r\ngive you anything else?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, yes,\u201D replied La Sarriette; \u201Csince I\u2019m about it, I think I\u2019ll\r\nhave a pound of lard. I\u2019m awfully fond of fried potatoes; I can make a\r\nbreakfast off a penn\u2019orth of potatoes and a bunch of radishes. Yes,\r\nI\u2019ll have a pound of lard, please, Madame Quenu.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa placed a sheet of stout paper in the pan of the scales. Then she\r\ntook the lard out of a jar under the shelves with a boxwood spatula,\r\ngently adding small quantities to the fatty heap, which began to melt\r\nand run slightly. When the plate of the scale fell, she took up the\r\npaper, folded it, and rapidly twisted the ends with her finger-tips.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat makes twenty-four sous,\u201D she said; \u201Cthe bacon is six sous\u2014thirty\r\nsous altogether. There\u2019s nothing else you want, is there?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D said La Sarriette, \u201Cnothing.\u201D She paid her money, still laughing\r\nand showing her teeth, and staring the men in the face. Her grey skirt\r\nwas all awry, and her loosely fastened red neckerchief allowed a little\r\nof her white bosom to appear. Before she went away she stepped up to\r\nGavard again, and pretending to threaten him exclaimed: \u201CSo you won\u2019t\r\ntell me what you were talking about as I came in? I could see you\r\nlaughing from the street. Oh, you sly fellow! Ah! I sha\u2019n\u2019t love you\r\nany longer!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she left the shop and ran across the road.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was Mademoiselle Saget who sent her here,\u201D remarked handsome Lisa\r\ndrily.\r\n\r\nThen silence fell again for some moments. Gavard was dismayed at\r\nFlorent\u2019s reception of his proposal. Lisa was the first to speak. \u201CIt\r\nwas wrong of you to refuse the post, Florent,\u201D she said in the most\r\nfriendly tones. \u201CYou know how difficult it is to find any employment,\r\nand you are not in a position to be over-exacting.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have my reasons,\u201D Florent replied.\r\n\r\nLisa shrugged her shoulders. \u201CCome now,\u201D said she, \u201Cyou really can\u2019t be\r\nserious, I\u2019m sure. I can understand that you are not in love with the\r\nGovernment, but it would be too absurd to let your opinions prevent you\r\nfrom earning your living. And, besides, my dear fellow, the Emperor\r\nisn\u2019t at all a bad sort of man. You don\u2019t suppose, do you, that he knew\r\nyou were eating mouldy bread and tainted meat? He can\u2019t be everywhere,\r\nyou know, and you can see for yourself that he hasn\u2019t prevented us here\r\nfrom doing pretty well. You are not at all just; indeed you are not.\u201D\r\n\r\nGavard, however, was getting very fidgety. He could not bear to hear\r\npeople speak well of the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, Madame Quenu,\u201D he interrupted; \u201Cyou are going too far. It is a\r\nscoundrelly system altogether.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, as for you,\u201D exclaimed Lisa vivaciously, \u201Cyou\u2019ll never rest until\r\nyou\u2019ve got yourself plundered and knocked on the head as the result of\r\nall your wild talk. Don\u2019t let us discuss politics; you would only make\r\nme angry. The question is Florent, isn\u2019t it? Well, for my part, I say\r\nthat he ought to accept this inspectorship. Don\u2019t you think so too,\r\nQuenu?\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu, who had not yet said a word, was very much put out by his wife\u2019s\r\nsudden appeal.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a good berth,\u201D he replied, without compromising himself.\r\n\r\nThen, amidst another interval of awkward silence, Florent resumed: \u201CI\r\nbeg you, let us drop the subject. My mind is quite made up. I shall\r\nwait.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou will wait!\u201D cried Lisa, losing patience.\r\n\r\nTwo rosy fires had risen to her cheeks. As she stood there, erect, in\r\nher white apron, with rounded, swelling hips, it was with difficulty\r\nthat she restrained herself from breaking out into bitter words.\r\nHowever, the entrance of another person into the shop arrested her\r\nanger. The new arrival was Madame Lec\u0153ur.\r\n\r\n\u201CCan you let me have half a pound of mixed meats at fifty sous the\r\npound?\u201D she asked.\r\n\r\nShe at first pretended not to notice her brother-in-law; but presently\r\nshe just nodded her head to him, without speaking. Then she scrutinised\r\nthe three men from head to foot, doubtless hoping to divine their\r\nsecret by the manner in which they waited for her to go. She could see\r\nthat she was putting them out, and the knowledge of this rendered her\r\nyet more sour and angular, as she stood there in her limp skirts, with\r\nher long, spider-like arms bent and her knotted fingers clasped beneath\r\nher apron. Then, as she coughed slightly, Gavard, whom the silence\r\nembarrassed, inquired if she had a cold.\r\n\r\nShe curtly answered in the negative. Her tightly stretched skin was of\r\na red-brick colour on those parts of her face where her bones\r\nprotruded, and the dull fire burning in her eyes and scorching their\r\nlids testified to some liver complaint nurtured by the querulous\r\njealousy of her disposition. She turned round again towards the\r\ncounter, and watched each movement made by Lisa as she served her with\r\nthe distrustful glance of one who is convinced that an attempt will be\r\nmade to defraud her.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t give me any saveloy,\u201D she exclaimed; \u201CI don\u2019t like it.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa had taken up a slender knife, and was cutting some thin slices of\r\nsausage. She next passed on to the smoked ham and the common ham,\r\ncutting delicate slices from each, and bending forward slightly as she\r\ndid so, with her eyes ever fixed on the knife. Her plump rosy hands,\r\nflitting about the viands with light and gentle touches, seemed to have\r\nderived suppleness from contact with all the fat.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou would like some larded veal, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201D she asked, bringing a\r\nyellow pan towards her.\r\n\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur seemed to be thinking the matter over at considerable\r\nlength; however, she at last said that she would have some. Lisa had\r\nnow begun to cut into the contents of the pans, from which she removed\r\nslices of larded veal and hare _pat\u00E9_ on the tip of a broad-bladed\r\nknife. And she deposited each successive slice on the middle of a sheet\r\nof paper placed on the scales.\r\n\r\n\u201CAren\u2019t you going to give me some of the boar\u2019s head with pistachio\r\nnuts?\u201D asked Madame Lec\u0153ur in her querulous voice.\r\n\r\nLisa was obliged to add some of the boar\u2019s head. But the butter dealer\r\nwas getting exacting, and asked for two slices of galantine. She was\r\nvery fond of it. Lisa, who was already irritated, played impatiently\r\nwith the handles of the knives, and told her that the galantine was\r\ntruffled, and that she could only include it in an \u201Cassortment\u201D at\r\nthree francs the pound. Madame Lec\u0153ur, however, continued to pry into\r\nthe dishes, trying to find something else to ask for. When the\r\n\u201Cassortment\u201D was weighed she made Lisa add some jelly and gherkins to\r\nit. The block of jelly, shaped like a Savoy cake, shook on its white\r\nchina dish beneath the angry violence of Lisa\u2019s hand; and as with her\r\nfinger-tips she took a couple of gherkins from a jar behind the heater,\r\nshe made the vinegar spurt over the sides.\r\n\r\n\u201CTwenty-five sous, isn\u2019t it?\u201D Madame Lec\u0153ur leisurely inquired.\r\n\r\nShe fully perceived Lisa\u2019s covert irritation, and greatly enjoyed the\r\nsight of it, producing her money as slowly as possible, as though,\r\nindeed, her silver had got lost amongst the coppers in her pocket. And\r\nshe glanced askance at Gavard, relishing the embarrassed silence which\r\nher presence was prolonging, and vowing that she would not go off,\r\nsince they were hiding some trickery or other from her. However, Lisa\r\nat last put the parcel in her hands, and she was then obliged to make\r\nher departure. She went away without saying a word, but darting a\r\nsearching glance all round the shop.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was that Saget who sent her too!\u201D burst out Lisa, as soon as the\r\nold woman was gone. \u201CIs the old wretch going to send the whole market\r\nhere to try to find out what we talk about? What a prying, malicious\r\nset they are! Did anyone ever hear before of crumbed cutlets and\r\n\u2018assortments\u2019 being bought at five o\u2019clock in the afternoon? But then\r\nthey\u2019d rack themselves with indigestion rather than not find out! Upon\r\nmy word, though, if La Saget sends anyone else here, you\u2019ll see the\r\nreception she\u2019ll get. I would bundle her out of the shop, even if she\r\nwere my own sister!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe three men remained silent in presence of this explosion of anger.\r\nGavard had gone to lean over the brass rail of the window-front, where,\r\nseemingly lost in thought, he began playing with one of the cut-glass\r\nbalusters detached from its wire fastening. Presently, however, he\r\nraised his head. \u201CWell, for my part,\u201D he said, \u201CI looked upon it all as\r\nan excellent joke.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLooked upon what as a joke?\u201D asked Lisa, still quivering with\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe inspectorship.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe raised her hands, gave a last glance at Florent, and then sat down\r\nupon the cushioned bench behind the counter and said nothing further.\r\nGavard, however, began to explain his views at length; the drift of his\r\nargument being that it was the Government which would look foolish in\r\nthe matter, since Florent would be taking its money.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy dear fellow,\u201D he said complacently, \u201Cthose scoundrels all but\r\nstarved you to death, didn\u2019t they? Well, you must make them feed you\r\nnow. It\u2019s a splendid idea; it caught my fancy at once!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent smiled, but still persisted in his refusal. Quenu, in the hope\r\nof pleasing his wife, did his best to find some good arguments. Lisa,\r\nhowever, appeared to pay no further attention to them. For the last\r\nmoment or two she had been looking attentively in the direction of the\r\nmarkets. And all at once she sprang to her feet again, exclaiming, \u201CAh!\r\nit is La Normande that they are sending to play the spy on us now!\r\nWell, so much the worse for La Normande; she shall pay for the others!\u201D\r\n\r\nA tall female pushed the shop door open. It was the handsome fish-girl,\r\nLouise Mehudin, generally known as La Normande. She was a bold-looking\r\nbeauty, with a delicate white skin, and was almost as plump as Lisa,\r\nbut there was more effrontery in her glance, and her bosom heaved with\r\nwarmer life. She came into the shop with a light swinging step, her\r\ngold chain jingling on her apron, her bare hair arranged in the latest\r\nstyle, and a bow at her throat, a lace bow, which made her one of the\r\nmost coquettish-looking queens of the markets. She brought a vague\r\nodour of fish with her, and a herring-scale showed like a tiny patch of\r\nmother-of-pearl near the little finger of one of her hands. She and\r\nLisa having lived in the same house in the Rue Pirouette, were intimate\r\nfriends, linked by a touch of rivalry which kept each of them busy with\r\nthoughts of the other. In the neighbourhood people spoke of \u201Cthe\r\nbeautiful Norman,\u201D just as they spoke of \u201Cbeautiful Lisa.\u201D This brought\r\nthem into opposition and comparison, and compelled each of them to do\r\nher utmost to sustain her reputation for beauty. Lisa from her counter\r\ncould, by stooping a little, perceive the fish-girl amidst her salmon\r\nand turbot in the pavilion opposite; and each kept a watch on the\r\nother. Beautiful Lisa laced herself more tightly in her stays; and the\r\nbeautiful Norman replied by placing additional rings on her fingers and\r\nadditional bows on her shoulders. When they met they were very bland\r\nand unctuous and profuse in compliments; but all the while their eyes\r\nwere furtively glancing from under their lowered lids, in the hope of\r\ndiscovering some flaw. They made a point of always dealing with each\r\nother, and professed great mutual affection.\r\n\r\n\u201CI say,\u201D said La Normande, with her smiling air, \u201Cit\u2019s to-morrow\r\nevening that you make your black-puddings, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa maintained a cold demeanour. She seldom showed any anger; but when\r\nshe did it was tenacious, and slow to be appeased. \u201CYes,\u201D she replied\r\ndrily, with the tips of her lips.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m so fond of black-puddings, you know, when they come straight out\r\nof the pot,\u201D resumed La Normande. \u201CI\u2019ll come and get some of you\r\nto-morrow.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was conscious of her rival\u2019s unfriendly greeting. However, she\r\nglanced at Florent, who seemed to interest her; and then, unwilling to\r\ngo off without having the last word, she was imprudent enough to add:\r\n\u201CI bought some black-pudding of you the day before yesterday, you know,\r\nand it wasn\u2019t quite sweet.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot quite sweet!\u201D repeated Lisa, very pale, and her lips quivering.\r\n\r\nShe might, perhaps, have once more restrained herself, for fear of La\r\nNormande imagining that she was overcome by envious spite at the sight\r\nof the lace bow; but the girl, not content with playing the spy,\r\nproceeded to insult her, and that was beyond endurance. So, leaning\r\nforward, with her hands clenched on the counter, she exclaimed, in a\r\nsomewhat hoarse voice: \u201CI say! when you sold me that pair of soles last\r\nweek, did I come and tell you, before everybody that they were\r\nstinking?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CStinking! My soles stinking!\u201D cried the fish dealer, flushing scarlet.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they remained silent, choking with anger, but glaring\r\nfiercely at each other over the array of dishes. All their honeyed\r\nfriendship had vanished; a word had sufficed to reveal what sharp teeth\r\nthere were behind their smiling lips.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re a vulgar, low creature!\u201D cried the beautiful Norman. \u201CYou\u2019ll\r\nnever catch me setting foot in here again, I can tell you!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGet along with you, get along with you,\u201D exclaimed beautiful Lisa. \u201CI\r\nknow quite well whom I\u2019ve got to deal with!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe fish-girl went off, hurling behind her a coarse expression which\r\nleft Lisa quivering. The whole scene had passed so quickly that the\r\nthree men, overcome with amazement, had not had time to interfere. Lisa\r\nsoon recovered herself, and was resuming the conversation, without\r\nmaking any allusion to what had just occurred, when the shop girl,\r\nAugustine, returned from an errand on which she had been sent. Lisa\r\nthereupon took Gavard aside, and after telling him to say nothing for\r\nthe present to Monsieur Verlaque, promised that she would undertake to\r\nconvince her brother-in-law in a couple of days\u2019 time at the utmost.\r\nQuenu then returned to his kitchen, while Gavard took Florent off with\r\nhim. And as they were just going into Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s to drink a\r\ndrop of vermouth together he called his attention to three women\r\nstanding in the covered way between the fish and poultry pavilions.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re cackling together!\u201D he said with an envious air.\r\n\r\nThe markets were growing empty, and Mademoiselle Saget, Madame Lec\u0153ur,\r\nand La Sarriette alone lingered on the edge of the footway. The old\r\nmaid was holding forth.\r\n\r\n\u201CAs I told you before, Madame Lec\u0153ur,\u201D said she, \u201Cthey\u2019ve always got\r\nyour brother-in-law in their shop. You saw him there yourself just now,\r\ndidn\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh yes, indeed! He was sitting on a table, and seemed quite at home.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, for my part,\u201D interrupted La Sarriette, \u201CI heard nothing wrong;\r\nand I can\u2019t understand why you\u2019re making such a fuss.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget shrugged her shoulders. \u201CAh, you\u2019re very innocent\r\nyet, my dear,\u201D she said. \u201CCan\u2019t you see why the Quenus are always\r\nattracting Monsieur Gavard to their place? Well, I\u2019ll wager that he\u2019ll\r\nleave all he has to their little Pauline.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou believe that, do you?\u201D cried Madame Lec\u0153ur, white with rage. Then,\r\nin a mournful voice, as though she had just received some heavy blow,\r\nshe continued: \u201CI am alone in the world, and have no one to take my\r\npart; he is quite at liberty to do as he pleases. His niece sides with\r\nhim too\u2014you heard her just now. She has quite forgotten all that she\r\ncost me, and wouldn\u2019t stir a hand to help me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed, aunt,\u201D exclaimed La Sarriette, \u201Cyou are quite wrong there!\r\nIt\u2019s you who\u2019ve never had anything but unkind words for me.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey became reconciled on the spot, and kissed one another. The niece\r\npromised that she would play no more pranks, and the aunt swore by all\r\nshe held most sacred that she looked upon La Sarriette as her own\r\ndaughter. Then Mademoiselle Saget advised them as to the steps they\r\nought to take to prevent Gavard from squandering his money. And they\r\nall agreed that the Quenu-Gradelles were very disreputable folks, and\r\nrequired closely watching.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re up to just now,\u201D said the old maid, \u201Cbut\r\nthere\u2019s something suspicious going on, I\u2019m sure. What\u2019s your opinion,\r\nnow, of that fellow Florent, that cousin of Madame Quenu\u2019s?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe three women drew more closely together, and lowered their voices.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou remember,\u201D said Madame Lec\u0153ur, \u201Cthat we saw him one morning with\r\nhis boots all split, and his clothes covered with dust, looking just\r\nlike a thief who\u2019s been up to some roguery. That fellow quite frightens\r\nme.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, he\u2019s certainly very thin,\u201D said La Sarriette, \u201Cbut he isn\u2019t\r\nugly.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget was reflecting, and she expressed her thoughts\r\naloud. \u201CI\u2019ve been trying to find out something about him for the last\r\nfortnight, but I can make nothing of it. Monsieur Gavard certainly\r\nknows him. I must have met him myself somewhere before, but I can\u2019t\r\nremember where.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was still ransacking her memory when La Normande swept up to them\r\nlike a whirlwind. She had just left the pork shop.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat big booby Lisa has got nice manners, I must say!\u201D she cried,\r\ndelighted to be able to relieve herself. \u201CFancy her telling me that I\r\nsold nothing but stinking fish! But I gave her as good as she deserved,\r\nI can tell you! A nice den they keep, with their tainted pig meat which\r\npoisons all their customers!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut what had you been saying to her?\u201D asked the old maid, quite frisky\r\nwith excitement, and delighted to hear that the two women had\r\nquarrelled.\r\n\r\n\u201CI! I\u2019d said just nothing at all\u2014no, not that! I just went into the\r\nshop and told her very civilly that I\u2019d buy some black-pudding\r\nto-morrow evening, and then she overwhelmed me with abuse. A dirty\r\nhypocrite she is, with her saint-like airs! But she\u2019ll pay more dearly\r\nfor this than she fancies!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe three women felt that La Normande was not telling them the truth,\r\nbut this did not prevent them from taking her part with a rush of bad\r\nlanguage. They turned towards the Rue Rambuteau with insulting mien,\r\ninventing all sorts of stories about the uncleanliness of the cookery\r\nat the Quenu\u2019s shop, and making the most extraordinary accusations. If\r\nthe Quenus had been detected selling human flesh the women could not\r\nhave displayed more violent and threatening anger. The fish-girl was\r\nobliged to tell her story three times over.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what did the cousin say?\u201D asked Mademoiselle Saget, with wicked\r\nintent.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe cousin!\u201D repeated La Normande, in a shrill voice. \u201CDo you really\r\nbelieve that he\u2019s a cousin? He\u2019s some lover or other, I\u2019ll wager, the\r\ngreat booby!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe three others protested against this. Lisa\u2019s honourability was an\r\narticle of faith in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\u201CStuff and nonsense!\u201D retorted La Normande. \u201CYou can never be sure\r\nabout those smug, sleek hypocrites.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget nodded her head as if to say that she was not very\r\nfar from sharing La Normande\u2019s opinion. And she softly added:\r\n\u201CEspecially as this cousin has sprung from no one knows where; for it\u2019s\r\na very doubtful sort of account that the Quenus give of him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, he\u2019s the fat woman\u2019s sweetheart, I tell you!\u201D reaffirmed the\r\nfish-girl; \u201Csome scamp or vagabond picked up in the streets. It\u2019s easy\r\nenough to see it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe has given him a complete outfit,\u201D remarked Madame Lec\u0153ur. \u201CHe must\r\nbe costing her a pretty penny.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, yes,\u201D muttered the old maid; \u201Cperhaps you are right. I must\r\nreally get to know something about him.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen they all promised to keep one another thoroughly informed of\r\nwhatever might take place in the Quenu-Gradelle establishment. The\r\nbutter dealer pretended that she wished to open her brother-in-law\u2019s\r\neyes as to the sort of places he frequented. However, La Normande\u2019s\r\nanger had by this time toned down, and, a good sort of girl at heart,\r\nshe went off, weary of having talked so much on the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure that La Normande said something or other insolent,\u201D remarked\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur knowingly, when the fish-girl had left them. \u201CIt is just\r\nher way; and it scarcely becomes a creature like her to talk as she did\r\nof Lisa.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe three women looked at each other and smiled. Then, when Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur also had gone off, La Sarriette remarked to Mademoiselle Saget:\r\n\u201CIt is foolish of my aunt to worry herself so much about all these\r\naffairs. It\u2019s that which makes her so thin. Ah! she\u2019d have willingly\r\ntaken Gavard for a husband if she could only have got him. Yet she used\r\nto beat me if ever a young man looked my way.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget smiled once more. And when she found herself alone,\r\nand went back towards the Rue Pirouette, she reflected that those three\r\ncackling hussies were not worth a rope to hang them. She was, indeed, a\r\nlittle afraid that she might have been seen with them, and the idea\r\nsomewhat troubled her, for she realised that it would be bad policy to\r\nfall out with the Quenu-Gradelles, who, after all, were well-to-do\r\nfolks and much esteemed. So she went a little out of her way on purpose\r\nto call at Taboureau the baker\u2019s in the Rue Turbigo\u2014the finest baker\u2019s\r\nshop in the whole neighbourhood. Madame Taboureau was not only an\r\nintimate friend of Lisa\u2019s, but an accepted authority on every subject.\r\nWhen it was remarked that \u201CMadame Taboureau had said this,\u201D or \u201CMadame\r\nTaboureau had said that,\u201D there was no more to be urged. So the old\r\nmaid, calling at the baker\u2019s under pretence of inquiring at what time\r\nthe oven would be hot, as she wished to bring a dish of pears to be\r\nbaked, took the opportunity to eulogise Lisa, and lavish praise upon\r\nthe sweetness and excellence of her black-puddings. Then, well pleased\r\nat having prepared this moral alibi and delighted at having done what\r\nshe could to fan the flames of a quarrel without involving herself in\r\nit, she briskly returned home, feeling much easier in her mind, but\r\nstill striving to recall where she had previously seen Madame Quenu\u2019s\r\nso-called cousin.\r\n\r\nThat same evening, after dinner, Florent went out and strolled for some\r\ntime in one of the covered ways of the markets. A fine mist was rising,\r\nand a grey sadness, which the gas lights studded as with yellow tears,\r\nhung over the deserted pavilions. For the first time Florent began to\r\nfeel that he was in the way, and to recognise the unmannerly fashion in\r\nwhich he, thin and artless, had tumbled into this world of fat people;\r\nand he frankly admitted to himself that his presence was disturbing the\r\nwhole neighbourhood, and that he was a source of discomfort to the\r\nQuenus\u2014a spurious cousin of far too compromising appearance. These\r\nreflections made him very sad; not, indeed, that they had noticed the\r\nslightest harshness on the part of his brother or Lisa: it was their\r\nvery kindness, rather, that was troubling him, and he accused himself\r\nof a lack of delicacy in quartering himself upon them. He was beginning\r\nto doubt the propriety of his conduct. The recollection of the\r\nconversation in the shop during the afternoon caused him a vague\r\ndisquietude. The odour of the viands on Lisa\u2019s counter seemed to\r\npenetrate him; he felt himself gliding into nerveless, satiated\r\ncowardice. Perhaps he had acted wrongly in refusing the inspectorship\r\noffered him. This reflection gave birth to a stormy struggle in his\r\nmind, and he was obliged to brace and shake himself before he could\r\nrecover his wonted rigidity of principles. However, a moist breeze had\r\nrisen, and was blowing along the covered way, and he regained some\r\ndegree of calmness and resolution on being obliged to button up his\r\ncoat. The wind seemingly swept from his clothes all the greasy odour of\r\nthe pork shop, which had made him feel so languid.\r\n\r\nHe was returning home when he met Claude Lantier. The artist, hidden in\r\nthe folds of his greenish overcoat, spoke in a hollow voice full of\r\nsuppressed anger. He was in a passion with painting, declared that it\r\nwas a dog\u2019s trade, and swore that he would not take up a brush again as\r\nlong as he lived. That very afternoon he had thrust his foot through a\r\nstudy which he had been making of the head of that hussy Cadine.\r\n\r\nClaude was subject to these outbursts, the fruit of his inability to\r\nexecute the lasting, living works which he dreamed of. And at such\r\ntimes life became an utter blank to him, and he wandered about the\r\nstreets, wrapped in the gloomiest thoughts, and waiting for the morning\r\nas for a sort of resurrection. He used to say that he felt bright and\r\ncheerful in the morning, and horribly miserable in the evening.[*] Each\r\nof his days was a long effort ending in disappointment. Florent\r\nscarcely recognised in him the careless night wanderer of the markets.\r\nThey had already met again at the pork shop, and Claude, who knew the\r\nfugitive\u2019s story, had grasped his hand and told him that he was a\r\nsterling fellow. It was very seldom, however, that the artist went to\r\nthe Quenus\u2019.\r\n\r\n[*] Claude Lantier\u2019s struggle for fame is fully described in M. Zola\u2019s\r\nnovel, _L\u2019Oeuvre_ (\u201CHis Masterpiece\u201D). \u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you still at my aunt\u2019s?\u201D he asked. \u201CI can\u2019t imagine how you manage\r\nto exist amidst all that cookery. The places reeks with the smell of\r\nmeat. When I\u2019ve been there for an hour I feel as though I shouldn\u2019t\r\nwant anything to eat for another three days. I ought not to have gone\r\nthere this morning; it was that which made me make a mess of my work.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, after he and Florent had taken a few steps in silence, he\r\nresumed:\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! the good people! They quite grieve me with their fine health. I\r\nhad thought of painting their portraits, but I\u2019ve never been able to\r\nsucceed with such round faces, in which there is never a bone. Ah! You\r\nwouldn\u2019t find my aunt Lisa kicking her foot through her pans! I was an\r\nidiot to have destroyed Cadine\u2019s head! Now that I come to think of it,\r\nit wasn\u2019t so very bad, perhaps, after all.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen they began to talk about Aunt Lisa. Claude said that his mother[*]\r\nhad not seen anything of her for a long time, and he hinted that the\r\npork butcher\u2019s wife was somewhat ashamed of her sister having married a\r\ncommon working man; moreover, she wasn\u2019t at all fond of unfortunate\r\nfolks. Speaking of himself, he told Florent that a benevolent gentleman\r\nhad sent him to college, being very pleased with the donkeys and old\r\nwomen that he had managed to draw when only eight years old; but the\r\ngood soul had died, leaving him an income of a thousand francs, which\r\njust saved him from perishing of hunger.\r\n\r\n[*] Gervaise, the heroine of the _Assommoir_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CAll the same, I would rather have been a working man,\u201D continued\r\nClaude. \u201CLook at the carpenters, for instance. They are very happy\r\nfolks, the carpenters. They have a table to make, say; well, they make\r\nit, and then go off to bed, happy at having finished the table, and\r\nperfectly satisfied with themselves. Now I, on the other hand, scarcely\r\nget any sleep at nights. All those confounded pictures which I can\u2019t\r\nfinish go flying about my brain. I never get anything finished and done\r\nwith\u2014never, never!\u201D\r\n\r\nHis voice almost broke into a sob. Then he attempted to laugh; and\r\nafterwards began to swear and pour forth coarse expressions, with the\r\ncold rage of one who, endowed with a delicate, sensitive mind, doubts\r\nhis own powers, and dreams of wallowing in the mire. He ended by\r\nsquatting down before one of the gratings which admit air into the\r\ncellars beneath the markets\u2014cellars where the gas is continually kept\r\nburning. And in the depths below he pointed out Marjolin and Cadine\r\ntranquilly eating their supper, whilst seated on one of the stone\r\nblocks used for killing the poultry. The two young vagabonds had\r\ndiscovered a means of hiding themselves and making themselves at home\r\nin the cellars after the doors had been closed.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a magnificent animal he is, eh!\u201D exclaimed Claude, with envious\r\nadmiration, speaking of Marjolin. \u201CHe and Cadine are happy, at all\r\nevents! All they care for is eating and kissing. They haven\u2019t a care in\r\nthe world. Ah, you do quite right, after all, to remain at the pork\r\nshop; perhaps you\u2019ll grow sleek and plump there.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he suddenly went off. Florent climbed up to his garret, disturbed\r\nby Claude\u2019s nervous restlessness, which revived his own uncertainty. On\r\nthe morrow, he avoided the pork shop all the morning, and went for a\r\nlong walk on the quays. When he returned to lunch, however, he was\r\nstruck by Lisa\u2019s kindliness. Without any undue insistence she again\r\nspoke to him about the inspectorship, as of something which was well\r\nworth his consideration. As he listened to her, with a full plate in\r\nfront of him, he was affected, in spite of himself, by the prim comfort\r\nof his surroundings. The matting beneath his feet seemed very soft; the\r\ngleams of the brass hanging lamp, the soft, yellow tint of the\r\nwallpaper, and the bright oak of the furniture filled him with\r\nappreciation of a life spent in comfort, which disturbed his notions of\r\nright and wrong. He still, however, had sufficient strength to persist\r\nin his refusal, and repeated his reasons; albeit conscious of the bad\r\ntaste he was showing in thus ostentatiously parading his animosity and\r\nobstinacy in such a place. Lisa showed no signs of vexation; on the\r\ncontrary, she smiled, and the sweetness of her smile embarrassed\r\nFlorent far more than her suppressed irritation of the previous\r\nevening. At dinner the subject was not renewed; they talked solely of\r\nthe great winter saltings, which would keep the whole staff of the\r\nestablishment busily employed.\r\n\r\nThe evenings were growing cold, and as soon as they had dined they\r\nretired into the kitchen, where it was very warm. The room was so\r\nlarge, too, that several people could sit comfortably at the square\r\ncentral table, without in any way impeding the work that was going on.\r\nLighted by gas, the walls were coated with white and blue tiles to a\r\nheight of some five or six feet from the floor. On the left was a great\r\niron stove, in the three apertures of which were set three large round\r\npots, their bottoms black with soot. At the end was a small range,\r\nwhich, fitted with an oven and a smoking-place, served for the\r\nbroiling; and up above, over the skimming-spoons, ladles, and\r\nlong-handled forks, were several numbered drawers, containing rasped\r\nbread, both fine and coarse, toasted crumbs, spices, cloves, nutmegs,\r\nand pepper. On the right, leaning heavily against the wall, was the\r\nchopping-block, a huge mass of oak, slashed and scored all over.\r\nAttached to it were several appliances, an injecting pump, a\r\nforcing-machine, and a mechanical mincer, which, with their wheels and\r\ncranks, imparted to the place an uncanny and mysterious aspect,\r\nsuggesting some kitchen of the infernal regions.\r\n\r\nThen, all round the walls upon shelves, and even under the tables, were\r\niron pots, earthenware pans, dishes, pails, various kinds of tin\r\nutensils, a perfect battery of deep copper saucepans, and swelling\r\nfunnels, racks of knives and choppers, rows of larding-pins and\r\nneedles\u2014a perfect world of greasy things. In spite of the extreme\r\ncleanliness, grease was paramount; it oozed forth from between the blue\r\nand white tiles on the wall, glistened on the red tiles of the\r\nflooring, gave a greyish glitter to the stove, and polished the edges\r\nof the chopping-block with the transparent sheen of varnished oak. And,\r\nindeed, amidst the ever-rising steam, the continuous evaporation from\r\nthe three big pots, in which pork was boiling and melting, there was\r\nnot a single nail from ceiling to floor from which grease did not\r\nexude.\r\n\r\nThe Quenu-Gradelles prepared nearly all their stock themselves. All\r\nthat they procured from outside were the potted meats of celebrated\r\nfirms, with jars of pickles and preserves, sardines, cheese, and edible\r\nsnails. They consequently became very busy after September in filling\r\nthe cellars which had been emptied during the summer. They continued\r\nworking even after the shop had been closed for the night. Assisted by\r\nAuguste and Leon, Quenu would stuff sausages-skins, prepare hams, melt\r\ndown lard, and salt the different sorts of bacon. There was a\r\ntremendous noise of cauldrons and cleavers, and the odour of cooking\r\nspread through the whole house. All this was quite independent of the\r\ndaily business in fresh pork, _pat\u00E9 de fois gras_, hare patty,\r\ngalantine, saveloys and black-puddings.\r\n\r\nThat evening, at about eleven o\u2019clock, Quenu, after placing a couple of\r\npots on the fire in order to melt down some lard, began to prepare the\r\nblack-puddings. Auguste assisted him. At one corner of the square table\r\nLisa and Augustine sat mending linen, whilst opposite to them, on the\r\nother side, with his face turned towards the fireplace, was Florent.\r\nLeon was mincing some sausage-meat on the oak block in a slow,\r\nrhythmical fashion.\r\n\r\nAuguste first of all went out into the yard to fetch a couple of\r\njug-like cans full of pigs\u2019 blood. It was he who stuck the animals in\r\nthe slaughter house. He himself would carry away the blood and interior\r\nportions of the pigs, leaving the men who scalded the carcasses to\r\nbring them home completely dressed in their carts. Quenu asserted that\r\nno assistant in all Paris was Auguste\u2019 equal as a pig-sticker. The\r\ntruth was that Auguste was a wonderfully keen judge of the quality of\r\nthe blood; and the black-pudding proved good every time that he said\r\nsuch would be the case.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, will the black-pudding be good this time?\u201D asked Lisa.\r\n\r\nAugust put down the two cans and slowly answered: \u201CI believe so, Madame\r\nQuenu; yes, I believe so. I tell it at first by the way the blood\r\nflows. If it spurts out very gently when I pull out the knife, that\u2019s a\r\nbad sign, and shows that the blood is poor.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut doesn\u2019t that depend on how far the knife has been stuck in?\u201D asked\r\nQuenu.\r\n\r\nA smile came over Auguste\u2019s pale face. \u201CNo,\u201D he replied; \u201CI always let\r\nfour digits of the blade go in; that\u2019s the right way to measure. But\r\nthe best sign of all is when the blood runs out and I beat it with my\r\nhand when it pours into the pail; it ought to be of a good warmth, and\r\ncreamy, without being too thick.\u201D\r\n\r\nAugustine had put down her needle, and with her eyes raised was now\r\ngazing at Auguste. On her ruddy face, crowned by wiry chestnut hair,\r\nthere was an expression of profound attention. Lisa and even little\r\nPauline were also listening with deep interest.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I beat it, and beat it, and beat it,\u201D continued the young man,\r\nwhisking his hand about as though he were whipping cream. \u201CAnd then,\r\nwhen I take my hand out and look at it, it ought to be greased, as it\r\nwere, by the blood and equally coated all over. And if that\u2019s the case,\r\nanyone can say without fear of mistake that the black-puddings will be\r\ngood.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe remained for a moment in an easy attitude, complacently holding his\r\nhand in the air. This hand, which spent so much of its time in pails of\r\nblood, had brightly gleaming nails, and looked very rosy above his\r\nwhite sleeve. Quenu had nodded his head in approbation, and an interval\r\nof silence followed. Leon was still mincing. Pauline, however, after\r\nremaining thoughtful for a little while, mounted upon Florent\u2019s feet\r\nagain, and in her clear voice exclaimed: \u201CI say, cousin, tell me the\r\nstory of the gentleman who was eaten by the wild beasts!\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was probably the mention of the pig\u2019s blood which had aroused in the\r\nchild\u2019s mind the recollection of \u201Cthe gentleman who had been eaten by\r\nthe wild beasts.\u201D Florent did not at first understand what she referred\r\nto, and asked her what gentleman she meant. Lisa began to smile.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe wants you to tell her,\u201D she said, \u201Cthe story of that unfortunate\r\nman\u2014you know whom I mean\u2014which you told to Gavard one evening. She must\r\nhave heard you.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Florent grew very grave. The little girl got up, and taking the\r\nbig cat in her arms, placed it on his knees, saying that Mouton also\r\nwould like to hear the story. Mouton, however, leapt on to the table,\r\nwhere, with rounded back, he remained contemplating the tall, scraggy\r\nindividual who for the last fortnight had apparently afforded him\r\nmatter for deep reflection. Pauline meantime began to grow impatient,\r\nstamping her feet and insisting on hearing the story.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, tell her what she wants,\u201D said Lisa, as the child persisted and\r\nbecame quite unbearable; \u201Cshe\u2019ll leave us in peace then.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent remained silent for a moment longer, with his eyes turned\r\ntowards the floor. Then slowly raising his head he let his gaze rest\r\nfirst on the two women who were plying their needles, and next on Quenu\r\nand Auguste, who were preparing the pot for the black-puddings. The gas\r\nwas burning quietly, the stove diffused a gentle warmth, and all the\r\ngrease of the kitchen glistened in an atmosphere of comfort such as\r\nattends good digestion\r\n\r\nThen, taking little Pauline upon his knee, and smiling a sad smile,\r\nFlorent addressed himself to the child as follows[*]:\u2014\r\n\r\n[*] Florent\u2019s narrative is not romance, but is based on the statements\r\nof several of the innocent victims whom the third Napoleon transported\r\nto Cayenne when wading through blood to the power which he so\r\nmisused.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201COnce upon a time there was a poor man who was sent away, a long, long\r\nway off, right across the sea. On the ship which carried him were four\r\nhundred convicts, and he was thrown among them. He was forced to live\r\nfor five weeks amidst all those scoundrels, dressed like them in coarse\r\ncanvas, and feeding at their mess. Foul insects preyed on him, and\r\nterrible sweats robbed him of all his strength. The kitchen, the\r\nbakehouse, and the engine-room made the orlop deck so terribly hot that\r\nten of the convicts died from it. In the daytime they were sent up in\r\nbatches of fifty to get a little fresh air from the sea; and as the\r\ncrew of the ship feared them, a couple of cannons were pointed at the\r\nlittle bit of deck where they took exercise. The poor fellow was very\r\nglad indeed when his turn to go up came. His terrible perspiration then\r\nabated somewhat; still, he could not eat, and felt very ill. During the\r\nnight, when he was manacled again, and the rolling of the ship in the\r\nrough sea kept knocking him against his companions, he quite broke\r\ndown, and began to cry, glad to be able to do so without being seen.\u201D\r\n\r\nPauline was listening with dilated eyes, and her little hands crossed\r\nprimly in front of her.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut this isn\u2019t the story of the gentleman who was eaten by the wild\r\nbeasts,\u201D she interrupted. \u201CThis is quite a different story; isn\u2019t it\r\nnow, cousin?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWait a bit, and you\u2019ll see,\u201D replied Florent gently. \u201CI shall come to\r\nthe gentleman presently. I\u2019m telling you the whole story from the\r\nbeginning.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, thank you,\u201D murmured the child, with a delighted expression.\r\nHowever, she remained thoughtful, evidently struggling with some great\r\ndifficulty to which she could find no explanation. At last she spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut what had the poor man done,\u201D she asked, \u201Cthat he was sent away and\r\nput in the ship?\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa and Augustine smiled. They were quite charmed with the child\u2019s\r\nintelligence; and Lisa, without giving the little one a direct reply,\r\ntook advantage of the opportunity to teach her a lesson by telling her\r\nthat naughty children were also sent away in boats like that.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, then,\u201D remarked Pauline judiciously, \u201Cperhaps it served my\r\ncousin\u2019s poor man quite right if he cried all night long.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa resumed her sewing, bending over her work. Quenu had not listened.\r\nHe had been cutting some little rounds of onion over a pot placed on\r\nthe fire; and almost at once the onions began to crackle, raising a\r\nclear shrill chirrup like that of grasshoppers basking in the heat.\r\nThey gave out a pleasant odour too, and when Quenu plunged his great\r\nwooden spoon into the pot the chirruping became yet louder, and the\r\nwhole kitchen was filled with the penetrating perfume of the onions.\r\nAuguste meantime was preparing some bacon fat in a dish, and Leon\u2019s\r\nchopper fell faster and faster, and every now and then scraped the\r\nblock so as to gather together the sausage-meat, now almost a paste.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen they got across the sea,\u201D Florent continued, \u201Cthey took the man\r\nto an island called the Devil\u2019s Island,[*] where he found himself\r\namongst others who had been carried away from their own country. They\r\nwere all very unhappy. At first they were kept to hard labour, just\r\nlike convicts. The gendarme who had charge of them counted them three\r\ntimes every day, so as to be sure that none were missing. Later on,\r\nthey were left free to do as they liked, being merely locked up at\r\nnight in a big wooden hut, where they slept in hammocks stretched\r\nbetween two bars. At the end of the year they went about barefooted, as\r\ntheir boots were quite worn out, and their clothes had become so ragged\r\nthat their flesh showed through them. They had built themselves some\r\nhuts with trunks of trees as a shelter against the sun, which is\r\nterribly hot in those parts; but these huts did not shield them against\r\nthe mosquitoes, which covered them with pimples and swellings during\r\nthe night. Many of them died, and the others turned quite yellow, so\r\nshrunken and wretched, with their long, unkempt beards, that one could\r\nnot behold them without pity.\u201D\r\n\r\n[*] The \u00CEle du Diable. This spot was selected as the place of detention\r\nof Captain Dreyfus, the French officer convicted in 1894 of having\r\ndivulged important military documents to foreign powers.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CAuguste, give me the fat,\u201D cried Quenu; and when the apprentice had\r\nhanded him the dish he let the pieces of bacon-fat slide gently into\r\nthe pot, and then stirred them with his spoon. A yet denser steam now\r\nrose from the fireplace.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat did they give them to eat?\u201D asked little Pauline, who seemed\r\ndeeply interested.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey gave them maggoty rice and foul meat,\u201D answered Florent, whose\r\nvoice grew lower as he spoke. \u201CThe rice could scarcely be eaten. When\r\nthe meat was roasted and very well done it was just possible to swallow\r\nit; but if it was boiled, it smelt so dreadfully that the men had\r\nnausea and stomach ache.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019d rather have lived upon dry bread,\u201D said the child, after thinking\r\nthe matter carefully over.\r\n\r\nLeon, having finished the mincing, now placed the sausage-meat upon the\r\nsquare table in a dish. Mouton, who had remained seated with his eyes\r\nfixed upon Florent, as though filled with amazement by his story, was\r\nobliged to retreat a few steps, which he did with a very bad grace.\r\nThen he rolled himself up, with his nose close to the sausage-meat, and\r\nbegan to purr.\r\n\r\nLisa was unable to conceal her disgust and amazement. That foul rice,\r\nthat evil-smelling meat, seemed to her to be scarcely credible\r\nabominations, which disgraced those who had eaten them as much as it\r\ndid those who had provided them; and her calm, handsome face and round\r\nneck quivered with vague fear of the man who had lived upon such horrid\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, indeed, it was not a land of delights,\u201D Florent resumed,\r\nforgetting all about little Pauline, and fixing his dreamy eyes upon\r\nthe steaming pot. \u201CEvery day brought fresh annoyances\u2014perpetual\r\ngrinding tyranny, the violation of every principle of justice, contempt\r\nfor all human charity, which exasperated the prisoners, and slowly\r\nconsumed them with a fever of sickly rancour. They lived like wild\r\nbeasts, with the lash ceaselessly raised over their backs. Those\r\ntorturers would have liked to kill the poor man\u2014Oh, no; it can never be\r\nforgotten; it is impossible! Such sufferings will some day claim\r\nvengeance.\u201D\r\n\r\nHis voice had fallen, and the pieces of fat hissing merrily in the pot\r\ndrowned it with the sound of their boiling. Lisa, however, heard him,\r\nand was frightened by the implacable expression which had suddenly come\r\nover his face; and, recollecting the gentle look which he habitually\r\nwore, she judged him to be a hypocrite.\r\n\r\nFlorent\u2019s hollow voice had brought Pauline\u2019s interest and delight to\r\nthe highest pitch, and she fidgeted with pleasure on his knee.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut the man?\u201D she exclaimed. \u201CGo on about the man!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent looked at her, and then appeared to remember, and smiled his\r\nsad smile again.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe man,\u201D he continued, \u201Cwas weary of remaining on the island, and had\r\nbut one thought\u2014that of making his escape by crossing the sea and\r\nreaching the mainland, whose white coast line could be seen on the\r\nhorizon in clear weather. But it was no easy matter to escape. It was\r\nnecessary that a raft should be built, and as several of the prisoners\r\nhad already made their escape, all the trees on the island had been\r\nfelled to prevent the others from obtaining timber. The island was,\r\nindeed, so bare and naked, so scorched by the blazing sun, that life in\r\nit had become yet more perilous and terrible. However, it occurred to\r\nthe man and two of his companions to employ the timbers of which their\r\nhuts were built; and one evening they put out to sea on some rotten\r\nbeams, which they had fastened together with dry branches. The wind\r\ncarried them towards the coast. Just as daylight was about to appear,\r\nthe raft struck on a sandbank with such violence that the beams were\r\nsevered from their lashings and carried out to sea. The three poor\r\nfellows were almost engulfed in the sand. Two of them sank in it to\r\ntheir waists, while the third disappeared up to his chin, and his\r\ncompanions were obliged to pull him out. At last they reached a rock,\r\nso small that there was scarcely room for them to sit down upon it.\r\nWhen the sun rose they could see the coast in front of them, a bar of\r\ngrey cliffs stretching all along the horizon. Two, who knew how to\r\nswim, determined to reach those cliffs. They preferred to run the risk\r\nof being drowned at once to that of slowly starving on the rock. But\r\nthey promised their companion that they would return for him when they\r\nhad reached land and had been able to procure a boat.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, I know now!\u201D cried little Pauline, clapping her hands with glee.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s the story of the gentleman who was eaten by the crabs!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey succeeded in reaching the coast,\u201D continued Florent, \u201Cbut it was\r\nquite deserted; and it was only at the end of four days that they were\r\nable to get a boat. When they returned to the rock, they found their\r\ncompanion lying on his back, dead, and half-eaten by crabs, which were\r\nstill swarming over what remained of his body.\u201D[*]\r\n\r\n[*] In deference to the easily shocked feelings of the average English\r\nreader I have somewhat modified this passage. In the original M. Zola\r\nfully describes the awful appearance of the body.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nA murmur of disgust escaped Lisa and Augustine, and a horrified grimace\r\npassed over the face of Leon, who was preparing the skins for the\r\nblack-puddings. Quenu stopped in the midst of his work and looked at\r\nAuguste, who seemed to have turned faint. Only little Pauline was\r\nsmiling. In imagination the others could picture those swarming,\r\nravenous crabs crawling all over the kitchen, and mingling gruesome\r\nodours with the aroma of the bacon-fat and onions.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive me the blood,\u201D cried Quenu, who had not been following the story.\r\n\r\nAuguste came up to him with the two cans, from which he slowly poured\r\nthe blood, while Quenu, as it fell, vigorously stirred the now\r\nthickening contents of the pot. When the cans were emptied, Quenu\r\nreached up to one of the drawers above the range, and took out some\r\npinches of spice. Then he added a plentiful seasoning of pepper.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey left him there, didn\u2019t they,\u201D Lisa now asked of Florent, \u201Cand\r\nreturned themselves in safety?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAs they were going back,\u201D continued Florent, \u201Cthe wind changed, and\r\nthey were driven out into the open sea. A wave carried away one of\r\ntheir oars, and the water swept so furiously into the boat that their\r\nwhole time was taken up in baling it out with their hands. They tossed\r\nabout in this way in sight of the coast, carried away by squalls and\r\nthen brought back again by the tide, without a mouthful of bread to\r\neat, for their scanty stock of provisions had been consumed. This went\r\non for three days.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThree days!\u201D cried Lisa in stupefaction; \u201Cthree days without food!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, three days without food. When the east wind at last brought them\r\nto shore, one of them was so weak that he lay on the beach the whole\r\nday. In the evening he died. His companion had vainly attempted to get\r\nhim to chew some leaves which he gathered from the trees.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this point Augustine broke into a slight laugh. Then, ashamed at\r\nhaving done so and not wishing to be considered heartless, she\r\nstammered out in confusion: \u201COh! I wasn\u2019t laughing at that. It was\r\nMouton. Do just look at Mouton, madame.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Lisa in her turn began to smile. Mouton, who had been lying all\r\nthis time with his nose close to the dish of sausage-meat, had probably\r\nbegun to feel distressed and disgusted by the presence of all this\r\nfood, for he had risen and was rapidly scratching the table with his\r\npaws as though he wanted to bury the dish and its contents. At last,\r\nhowever, turning his back to it and lying down on his side, he\r\nstretched himself out, half closing his eyes and rubbing his head\r\nagainst the table with languid pleasure. Then they all began to\r\ncompliment Mouton. He never stole anything, they said, and could be\r\nsafely left with the meat. Pauline related that he licked her fingers\r\nand washed her face after dinner without trying to bite her.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lisa now came back to the question as to whether it were\r\npossible to live for three days without food. In her opinion it was\r\nnot. \u201CNo,\u201D she said, \u201CI can\u2019t believe it. No one ever goes three days\r\nwithout food. When people talk of a person dying of hunger, it is a\r\nmere expression. They always get something to eat, more or less. It is\r\nonly the most abandoned wretches, people who are utterly lost\u2014\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was doubtless going to add, \u201Cvagrant rogues,\u201D but she stopped short\r\nand looked at Florent. The scornful pout of her lips and the expression\r\nof her bright eyes plainly signified that in her belief only villains\r\nmade such prolonged fasts. It seemed to her that a man able to remain\r\nwithout food for three days must necessarily be a very dangerous\r\ncharacter. For, indeed, honest folks never placed themselves in such a\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nFlorent was now almost stifling. In front of him the stove, into which\r\nLeon had just thrown several shovelfuls of coal, was snoring like a lay\r\nclerk asleep in the sun; and the heat was very great. Auguste, who had\r\ntaken charge of the lard melting in the pots, was watching over it in a\r\nstate of perspiration, and Quenu wiped his brow with his sleeve whilst\r\nwaiting for the blood to mix. A drowsiness such as follows gross\r\nfeeding, an atmosphere heavy with indigestion, pervaded the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen the man had buried his comrade in the sand,\u201D Florent continued\r\nslowly, \u201Che walked off alone straight in front of him. Dutch Guiana, in\r\nwhich country he now was, is a land of forests intermingled with rivers\r\nand swamps. The man walked on for more than a week without coming\r\nacross a single human dwelling-place. All around, death seemed to be\r\nlurking and lying in wait for him. Though his stomach was racked by\r\nhunger, he often did not dare to eat the bright-coloured fruits which\r\nhung from the trees; he was afraid to touch the glittering berries,\r\nfearing lest they should be poisonous. For whole days he did not see a\r\npatch of sky, but tramped on beneath a canopy of branches, amidst a\r\ngreenish gloom that swarmed with horrible living creatures. Great birds\r\nflew over his head with a terrible flapping of wings and sudden strange\r\ncalls resembling death groans; apes sprang, wild animals rushed through\r\nthe thickets around him, bending the saplings and bringing down a rain\r\nof leaves, as though a gale were passing. But it was particularly the\r\nserpents that turned his blood cold when, stepping upon a matting of\r\nmoving, withered leaves, he caught sight of their slim heads gliding\r\namidst a horrid maze of roots. In certain nooks, nooks of dank shadow,\r\nswarming colonies of reptiles\u2014some black, some yellow, some purple,\r\nsome striped, some spotted, and some resembling withered reeds\u2014suddenly\r\nawakened into life and wriggled away. At such times the man would stop\r\nand look about for a stone on which he might take refuge from the soft\r\nyielding ground into which his feet sank; and there he would remain for\r\nhours, terror-stricken on espying in some open space near by a boa,\r\nwho, with tail coiled and head erect, swayed like the trunk of a big\r\ntree splotched with gold.\r\n\r\n\u201CAt night he used to sleep in the trees, alarmed by the slightest\r\nrustling of the branches, and fancying that he could hear endless\r\nswarms of serpents gliding through the gloom. He almost stifled beneath\r\nthe interminable expanse of foliage. The gloomy shade reeked with\r\nclose, oppressive heat, a clammy dankness and pestilential sweat,\r\nimpregnated with the coarse aroma of scented wood and malodorous\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd when at last, after a long weary tramp, the man made his way out\r\nof the forest and beheld the sky again, he found himself confronted by\r\nwide rivers which barred his way. He skirted their banks, keeping a\r\nwatchful eye on the grey backs of the alligators and the masses of\r\ndrifting vegetation, and then, when he came to a less\r\nsuspicious-looking spot, he swam across. And beyond the rivers the\r\nforests began again. At other times there were vast prairie lands,\r\nleagues of thick vegetation, in which, at distant intervals, small\r\nlakes gleamed bluely. The man then made a wide detour, and sounded the\r\nground beneath him before advancing, having but narrowly escaped from\r\nbeing swallowed up and buried beneath one of those smiling plains which\r\nhe could hear cracking at each step he took. The giant grass, nourished\r\nby all the collected humus, concealed pestiferous marshes, depths of\r\nliquid mud; and amongst the expanses of verdure spread over the\r\nglaucous immensity to the very horizon there were only narrow stretches\r\nof firm ground with which the traveller must be acquainted if he would\r\navoid disappearing for ever. One night the man sank down as far as his\r\nwaist. At each effort he made to extricate himself the mud threatened\r\nto rise to his mouth. Then he remained quite still for nearly a couple\r\nof hours; and when the moon rose he was fortunately able to catch hold\r\nof a branch of a tree above his head. By the time he reached a human\r\ndwelling his hands and feet were bruised and bleeding, swollen with\r\npoisonous stings. He presented such a pitiable, famished appearance\r\nthat those who saw him were afraid of him. They tossed him some food\r\nfifty yards away from the house, and the master of it kept guard over\r\nhis door with a loaded gun.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent stopped, his voice choked by emotion, and his eyes gazing\r\nblankly before him. For some minutes he had seemed to be speaking to\r\nhimself alone. Little Pauline, who had grown drowsy, was lying in his\r\narms with her head thrown back, though striving to keep her wondering\r\neyes open. And Quenu, for his part, appeared to be getting impatient.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, you stupid!\u201D he shouted to Leon, \u201Cdon\u2019t you know how to hold a\r\nskin yet? What do you stand staring at me for? It\u2019s the skin you should\r\nlook at, not me! There, hold it like that, and don\u2019t move again!\u201D\r\n\r\nWith his right hand Leon was raising a long string of sausage-skin, at\r\none end of which a very wide funnel was inserted; while with his left\r\nhand he coiled the black-pudding round a metal bowl as fast as Quenu\r\nfilled the funnel with big spoonfuls of the meat. The latter, black and\r\nsteaming, flowed through the funnel, gradually inflating the skin,\r\nwhich fell down again, gorged to repletion and curving languidly. As\r\nQuenu had removed the pot from the range both he and Leon stood out\r\nprominently, he broad visaged, and the lad slender of profile, in the\r\nburning glow which cast over their pale faces and white garments a\r\nflood of rosy light.\r\n\r\nLisa and Augustine watched the filling of the skin with great interest,\r\nLisa especially; and she in her turn found fault with Leon because he\r\nnipped the skin too tightly with his fingers, which caused knots to\r\nform, she said. When the skin was quite full, Quenu let it slip gently\r\ninto a pot of boiling water; and seemed quite easy in his mind again,\r\nfor now nothing remained but to leave it to boil.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd the man\u2014go on about the man!\u201D murmured Pauline, opening her eyes,\r\nand surprised at no longer hearing the narrative.\r\n\r\nFlorent rocked her on his knee, and resumed his story in a slow,\r\nmurmuring voice, suggestive of that of a nurse singing an infant to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe man,\u201D he said, \u201Carrived at a large town. There he was at first\r\ntaken for an escaped convict, and was kept in prison for several\r\nmonths. Then he was released, and turned his hand to all sorts of work.\r\nHe kept accounts and taught children to read, and at one time he was\r\neven employed as a navvy in making an embankment. He was continually\r\nhoping to return to his own country. He had saved the necessary amount\r\nof money when he was attacked by yellow fever. Then, believing him to\r\nbe dead, those about him divided his clothes amongst themselves; so\r\nthat when he at last recovered he had not even a shirt left. He had to\r\nbegin all over again. The man was very weak, and was afraid he might\r\nhave to remain where he was. But at last he was able to get away, and\r\nhe returned.\u201D\r\n\r\nHis voice had sunk lower and lower, and now died away altogether in a\r\nfinal quivering of his lips. The close of the story had lulled little\r\nPauline to sleep, and she was now slumbering with her head on Florent\u2019s\r\nshoulder. He held her with one arm, and still gently rocked her on his\r\nknee. No one seemed to pay any further attention to him, so he remained\r\nstill and quiet where he was, holding the sleeping child.\r\n\r\nNow came the tug of war, as Quenu said. He had to remove the\r\nblack-puddings from the pot. In order to avoid breaking them or getting\r\nthem entangled, he coiled them round a thick wooden pin as he drew them\r\nout, and then carried them into the yard and hung them on screens,\r\nwhere they quickly dried. Leon helped him, holding up the drooping\r\nends. And as these reeking festoons of black-pudding crossed the\r\nkitchen they left behind them a trail of odorous steam, which still\r\nfurther thickened the dense atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAuguste, on his side, after giving a hasty glance at the lard moulds,\r\nnow took the covers off the two pots in which the fat was simmering,\r\nand each bursting bubble discharged an acrid vapour into the kitchen.\r\nThe greasy haze had been gradually rising ever since the beginning of\r\nthe evening, and now it shrouded the gas and pervaded the whole room,\r\nstreaming everywhere, and veiling the ruddy whiteness of Quenu and his\r\ntwo assistants. Lisa and Augustine had risen from their seats; and all\r\nwere panting as though they had eaten too much.\r\n\r\nAugustine carried the sleeping Pauline upstairs; and Quenu, who liked\r\nto fasten up the kitchen himself, gave Auguste and Leon leave to go to\r\nbed, saying that he would fetch the black-pudding himself. The younger\r\napprentice stole off with a very red face, having managed to secrete\r\nunder his shirt nearly a yard of the pudding, which must have almost\r\nscalded him. Then the Quenus and Florent remained alone, in silence.\r\nLisa stood nibbling a little piece of the hot pudding, keeping her\r\npretty lips well apart all the while, for fear of burning them, and\r\ngradually the black compound vanished in her rosy mouth.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D said she, \u201CLa Normande was foolish in behaving so rudely; the\r\nblack-pudding\u2019s excellent to-day.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, there was a knock at the passage door, and Gavard, who stayed\r\nat Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s every evening until midnight, came in. He had\r\ncalled for a definite answer about the fish inspectorship.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must understand,\u201D he said, \u201Cthat Monsieur Verlaque cannot wait any\r\nlonger; he is too ill. So Florent must make up his mind. I have\r\npromised to give a positive answer early to-morrow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, Florent accepts,\u201D Lisa quietly remarked, taking another nibble\r\nat some black-pudding.\r\n\r\nFlorent, who had remained in his chair, overcome by a strange feeling\r\nof prostration, vainly endeavoured to rise and protest.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, say nothing,\u201D continued Lisa; \u201Cthe matter is quite settled.\r\nYou have suffered quite enough already, my dear Florent. What you have\r\njust been telling us is enough to make one shudder. It is time now for\r\nyou to settle down. You belong to a respectable family, you received a\r\ngood education, and it is really not fitting that you should go\r\nwandering about the highways like a vagrant. At your age childishness\r\nis no longer excusable. You have been foolish; well, all that will be\r\nforgotten and forgiven. You will take your place again among those of\r\nyour own class\u2014the class of respectable folks\u2014and live in future like\r\nother people.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent listened in astonishment, quite unable to say a word. Lisa was,\r\ndoubtless, right. She looked so healthy, so serene, that it was\r\nimpossible to imagine that she desired anything but what was proper. It\r\nwas he, with his fleshless body and dark, equivocal-looking\r\ncountenance, who must be in the wrong, and indulging in unrighteous\r\ndreams. He could, indeed, no longer understand why he had hitherto\r\nresisted.\r\n\r\nLisa, however, continued to talk to him with an abundant flow of words,\r\nas though he were a little boy found in fault and threatened with the\r\npolice. She assumed, indeed, a most maternal manner, and plied him with\r\nthe most convincing reasons. And at last, as a final argument, she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201CDo it for us, Florent. We occupy a fair position in the neighbourhood\r\nwhich obliges us to use a certain amount of circumspection; and, to\r\ntell you the truth, between ourselves, I\u2019m afraid that people will\r\nbegin to talk. This inspectorship will set everything right; you will\r\nbe somebody; you will even be an honour to us.\u201D\r\n\r\nHer manner had become caressingly persuasive, and Florent was\r\npenetrated by all the surrounding plenteousness, all the aroma filling\r\nthe kitchen, where he fed, as it were, on the nourishment floating in\r\nthe atmosphere. He sank into blissful meanness, born of all the copious\r\nfeeding that went on in the sphere of plenty in which he had been\r\nliving during the last fortnight. He felt, as it were, the titillation\r\nof forming fat which spread slowly all over his body. He experienced\r\nthe languid beatitude of shopkeepers, whose chief concern is to fill\r\ntheir bellies. At this late hour of night, in the warm atmosphere of\r\nthe kitchen, all his acerbity and determination melted away. That\r\npeaceable evening, with the odour of the black-pudding and the lard,\r\nand the sight of plump little Pauline slumbering on his knee, had so\r\nenervated him that he found himself wishing for a succession of such\r\nevenings\u2014endless ones which would make him fat.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was the sight of Mouton that chiefly decided him. Mouton\r\nwas sound asleep, with his stomach turned upwards, one of his paws\r\nresting on his nose, and his tail twisted over this side, as though to\r\nkeep him warm; and he was slumbering with such an expression of feline\r\nhappiness that Florent, as he gazed at him, murmured: \u201CNo, it would be\r\ntoo foolish! I accept the berth. Say that I accept it, Gavard.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Lisa finished eating her black-pudding, and wiped her fingers on\r\nthe edge of her apron. And next she got her brother-in-law\u2019s candle\r\nready for him, while Gavard and Quenu congratulated him on his\r\ndecision. It was always necessary for a man to settle down, said they;\r\nthe breakneck freaks of politics did not provide one with food. And,\r\nmeantime, Lisa, standing there with the lighted candle in her hand,\r\nlooked at him with an expression of satisfaction resting on her\r\nhandsome face, placid like that of some sacred cow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days later the necessary formalities were gone through, and\r\nwithout demur the police authorities at the Prefecture accepted Florent\r\non Monsieur Verlaque\u2019s recommendation as his substitute. Gavard, by the\r\nway, had made it a point to accompany them. When he again found himself\r\nalone with Florent he kept nudging his ribs with his elbow as they\r\nwalked along together, and laughed, without saying anything, while\r\nwinking his eyes in a jeering way. He seemed to find something very\r\nridiculous in the appearance of the police officers whom they met on\r\nthe Quai de l\u2019Horloge, for, as he passed them, he slightly shrugged his\r\nshoulders and made the grimace of a man seeking to restrain himself\r\nfrom laughing in people\u2019s faces.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Monsieur Verlaque began to initiate the new\r\ninspector into the duties of his office. It had been arranged that\r\nduring the next few days he should make him acquainted with the\r\nturbulent sphere which he would have to supervise. Poor Verlaque, as\r\nGavard called him was a pale little man, swathed in flannels,\r\nhandkerchiefs, and mufflers. Constantly coughing, he made his way\r\nthrough the cool, moist atmosphere, and running waters of the fish\r\nmarket, on a pair of scraggy legs like those of a sickly child.\r\n\r\nWhen Florent made his appearance on the first morning, at seven\r\no\u2019clock, he felt quite distracted; his eyes were dazed, his head ached\r\nwith all the noise and riot. Retail dealers were already prowling about\r\nthe auction pavilion; clerks were arriving with their ledgers, and\r\nconsigners\u2019 agents, with leather bags slung over their shoulders, sat\r\non overturned chairs by the salesmen\u2019s desks, waiting to receive their\r\ncash. Fish was being unloaded and unpacked not only in the enclosure,\r\nbut even on the footways. All along the latter were piles of small\r\nbaskets, an endless arrival of cases and hampers, and sacks of mussels,\r\nfrom which streamlets of water trickled. The auctioneers\u2019 assistants,\r\nall looking very busy, sprang over the heaps, tore away the straw at\r\nthe tops of the baskets, emptied the latter, and tossed them aside.\r\nThey then speedily transferred their contents in lots to huge\r\nwickerwork trays, arranging them with a turn of the hand so that they\r\nmight show to the best advantage. And when the large tray-like baskets\r\nwere all set out, Florent could almost fancy that a whole shoal of fish\r\nhad got stranded there, still quivering with life, and gleaming with\r\nrosy nacre, scarlet coral, and milky pearl, all the soft, pale, sheeny\r\nhues of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe deep-lying forests of seaweed, in which the mysterious life of the\r\nocean slumbers, seemed at one haul of the nets to have yielded up all\r\nthey contained. There were cod, keeling, whiting, flounders, plaice,\r\ndabs, and other sorts of common fish of a dingy grey with whitish\r\nsplotches; there were conger-eels, huge serpent-like creatures, with\r\nsmall black eyes and muddy, bluish skins, so slimy that they still\r\nseemed to be gliding along, yet alive. There were broad flat skate with\r\npale undersides edged with a soft red, and superb backs bumpy with\r\nvertebrae, and marbled down to the tautly stretched ribs of their fins\r\nwith splotches of cinnabar, intersected by streaks of the tint of\r\nFlorentine bronze\u2014a dark medley of colour suggestive of the hues of a\r\ntoad or some poisonous flower. Then, too, there were hideous dog-fish,\r\nwith round heads, widely-gaping mouths like those of Chinese idols, and\r\nshort fins like bats\u2019 wings; fit monsters to keep yelping guard over\r\nthe treasures of the ocean grottoes. And next came the finer fish,\r\ndisplayed singly on the osier trays; salmon that gleamed like chased\r\nsilver, every scale seemingly outlined by a graving-tool on a polished\r\nmetal surface; mullet with larger scales and coarser markings; large\r\nturbot and huge brill with firm flesh white like curdled milk;\r\ntunny-fish, smooth and glossy, like bags of blackish leather; and\r\nrounded bass, with widely gaping mouths which a soul too large for the\r\nbody seemed to have rent asunder as it forced its way out amidst the\r\nstupefaction of death. And on all sides there were sole, brown and\r\ngrey, in pairs; sand-eels, slim and stiff, like shavings of pewter;\r\nherrings, slightly twisted, with bleeding gills showing on their\r\nsilver-worked skins; fat dories tinged with just a suspicion of\r\ncarmine; burnished mackerel with green-streaked backs, and sides\r\ngleaming with ever-changing iridescence; and rosy gurnets with white\r\nbellies, their head towards the centre of the baskets and their tails\r\nradiating all around, so that they simulated some strange florescence\r\nsplotched with pearly white and brilliant vermilion. There were rock\r\nmullet, too, with delicious flesh, flushed with the pinky tinge\r\npeculiar to the Cyprinus family; boxes of whiting with opaline\r\nreflections; and baskets of smelts\u2014neat little baskets, pretty as those\r\nused for strawberries, and exhaling a strong scent of violets. And\r\nmeantime the tiny black eyes of the shrimps dotted as with beads of jet\r\ntheir soft-toned mass of pink and grey; and spiny crawfish and lobsters\r\nstriped with black, all still alive, raised a grating sound as they\r\ntried to crawl along with their broken claws.\r\n\r\nFlorent gave but indifferent attention to Monsieur Verlaque\u2019s\r\nexplanations. A flood of sunshine suddenly streamed through the lofty\r\nglass roof of the covered way, lighting up all these precious colours,\r\ntoned and softened by the waves\u2014the iridescent flesh-tints of the\r\nshell-fish, the opal of the whiting, the pearly nacre of the mackerel,\r\nthe ruddy gold of the mullets, the plated skins of the herrings, and\r\nmassive silver of the salmon. It was as though the jewel-cases of some\r\nsea-nymph had been emptied there\u2014a mass of fantastical, undreamt-of\r\nornaments, a streaming and heaping of necklaces, monstrous bracelets,\r\ngigantic brooches, barbaric gems and jewels, the use of which could not\r\nbe divined. On the backs of the skate and the dog-fish you saw, as it\r\nwere, big dull green and purple stones set in dark metal, while the\r\nslender forms of the sand-eels and the tails and fins of the smelts\r\ndisplayed all the delicacy of finely wrought silver-work.\r\n\r\nAnd meantime Florent\u2019s face was fanned by a fresh breeze, a sharp, salt\r\nbreeze redolent of the sea. It reminded him of the coasts of Guiana and\r\nhis voyages. He half fancied that he was gazing at some bay left dry by\r\nthe receding tide, with the seaweed steaming in the sun, the bare rocks\r\ndrying, and the beach smelling strongly of the brine. All around him\r\nthe fish in their perfect freshness exhaled a pleasant perfume, that\r\nslightly sharp, irritating perfume which depraves the appetite.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Verlaque coughed. The dampness was affecting him, and he\r\nwrapped his muffler more closely about his neck.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow,\u201D said he, \u201Cwe will pass on to the fresh water fish.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis was in a pavilion beside the fruit market, the last one, indeed,\r\nin the direction of the Rue Rambuteau. On either side of the space\r\nreserved for the auctions were large circular stone basins, divided\r\ninto separate compartments by iron gratings. Slender streams of water\r\nflowed from brass jets shaped like swan\u2019s necks; and the compartments\r\nwere filled with swarming colonies of crawfish, black-backed carp ever\r\non the move, and mazy tangles of eels, incessantly knotting and\r\nunknotting themselves. Again was Monsieur Verlaque attacked by an\r\nobstinate fit of coughing. The moisture of the atmosphere was more\r\ninsipid here than amongst the sea water fish: there was a riverside\r\nscent, as of sun-warmed water slumbering on a bed of sand.\r\n\r\nA great number of crawfishes had arrived from Germany that morning in\r\ncases and hampers, and the market was also crowded with river fish from\r\nHolland and England. Several men were unpacking shiny carp from the\r\nRhine, lustrous with ruddy metallic hues, their scales resembling\r\nbronzed _cloisonne_ enamel; and others were busy with huge pike, the\r\ncruel iron-grey brigands of the waters, who ravenously protruded their\r\nsavage jaws; or with magnificent dark-hued with verdigris. And amidst\r\nthese suggestions of copper, iron, and bronze, the gudgeon and perch,\r\nthe trout, the bleak, and the flat-fish taken in sweep-nets showed\r\nbrightly white, the steel-blue tints of their backs gradually toning\r\ndown to the soft transparency of their bellies. However, it was the fat\r\nsnowy-white barbel that supplied the liveliest brightness in this\r\ngigantic collection of still life.\r\n\r\nBags of young carp were being gently emptied into the basins. The fish\r\nspun round, then remained motionless for a moment, and at last shot\r\naway and disappeared. Little eels were turned out of their hampers in a\r\nmass, and fell to the bottom of the compartments like tangled knots of\r\nsnakes; while the larger ones\u2014those whose bodies were about as thick as\r\na child\u2019s arm\u2014raised their heads and slipped of their own accord into\r\nthe water with the supple motion of serpents gliding into the\r\nconcealment of a thicket. And meantime the other fish, whose death\r\nagony had been lasting all the morning as they lay on the soiled osiers\r\nof the basket-trays, slowly expired amidst all the uproar of the\r\nauctions, opening their mouths as though to inhale the moisture of the\r\nair, with great silent gasps, renewed every few seconds.\r\n\r\nHowever, Monsieur Verlaque brought Florent back to the salt water fish.\r\nHe took him all over the place and gave him the minutest particulars\r\nabout everything. Round the nine salesmen\u2019s desks ranged along three\r\nsides of the pavilion there was now a dense crowd of surging, swaying\r\nheads, above which appeared the clerks, perched upon high chairs and\r\nmaking entries in their ledgers.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre all these clerks employed by the salesmen?\u201D asked Florent.\r\n\r\nBy way of reply Monsieur Verlaque made a detour along the outside\r\nfootway, led him into the enclosure of one of the auctions, and then\r\nexplained the working of the various departments of the big yellow\r\noffice, which smelt strongly of fish and was stained all over by\r\ndrippings and splashings from the hampers. In a little glazed\r\ncompartment up above, the collector of the municipal dues took note of\r\nthe prices realised by the different lots of fish. Lower down, seated\r\nupon high chairs and with their wrists resting upon little desks, were\r\ntwo female clerks, who kept account of the business on behalf of the\r\nsalesmen. At each end of the stone table in front of the office was a\r\ncrier who brought the basket-trays forward in turn, and in a bawling\r\nvoice announced what each lot consisted of; while above him the female\r\nclerk, pen in hand, waited to register the price at which the lots were\r\nknocked down. And outside the enclosure, shut up in another little\r\noffice of yellow wood, Monsieur Verlaque showed Florent the cashier, a\r\nfat old woman, who was ranging coppers and five-franc pieces in piles.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is a double control, you see,\u201D said Monsieur Verlaque; \u201Cthe\r\ncontrol of the Prefecture of the Seine and that of the Prefecture of\r\nPolice. The latter, which licenses the salesmen, claims to have the\r\nright of supervision over them; and the municipality asserts its right\r\nto be represented at the transactions as they are subject to taxation.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe went on expatiating at length in his faint cold voice respecting the\r\nrival claims of the two Prefectures. Florent, however, was paying but\r\nlittle heed, his attention being concentrated on a female clerk sitting\r\non one of the high chairs just in front of him. She was a tall, dark\r\nwoman of thirty, with big black eyes and an easy calmness of manner,\r\nand she wrote with outstretched fingers like a girl who had been taught\r\nthe regulation method of the art.\r\n\r\nHowever, Florent\u2019s attention was diverted by the yelping of the crier,\r\nwho was just offering a magnificent turbot for sale.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve a bid of thirty francs! Thirty francs, now; thirty francs!\u201D\r\n\r\nHe repeated these words in all sorts of keys, running up and down a\r\nstrange scale of notes full of sudden changes. Humpbacked and with his\r\nface twisted askew, and his hair rough and disorderly, he wore a great\r\nblue apron with a bib; and with flaming eyes and outstretched arms he\r\ncried vociferously: \u201CThirty-one! thirty-two! thirty-three! Thirty-three\r\nfrancs fifty centimes! thirty-three fifty!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he paused to take breath, turning the basket-tray and pushing it\r\nfarther upon the table. The fish-wives bent forward and gently touched\r\nthe turbot with their finger-tips. Then the crier began again with\r\nrenewed energy, hurling his figures towards the buyers with a wave of\r\nthe hand and catching the slightest indication of a fresh bid\u2014the\r\nraising of a finger, a twist of the eyebrows, a pouting of the lips, a\r\nwink, and all with such rapidity and such a ceaseless jumble of words\r\nthat Florent, utterly unable to follow him, felt quite disconcerted\r\nwhen, in a sing-song voice like that of a priest intoning the final\r\nwords of a versicle, he chanted: \u201CForty-two! forty-two! The turbot goes\r\nfor forty-two francs.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was the beautiful Norman who had made the last bid. Florent\r\nrecognised her as she stood in the line of fish-wives crowding against\r\nthe iron rails which surrounded the enclosure. The morning was fresh\r\nand sharp, and there was a row of tippets above the display of big\r\nwhite aprons, covering the prominent bosoms and stomachs and sturdy\r\nshoulders. With high-set chignon set off with curls, and white and\r\ndainty skin, the beautiful Norman flaunted her lace bow amidst tangled\r\nshocks of hair covered with dirty kerchiefs, red noses eloquent of\r\ndrink, sneering mouths, and battered faces suggestive of old pots. And\r\nshe also recognised Madame Quenu\u2019s cousin, and was so surprised to see\r\nhim there that she began gossiping to her neighbours about him.\r\n\r\nThe uproar of voices had become so great that Monsieur Verlaque\r\nrenounced all further attempt to explain matters to Florent. On the\r\nfootway close by, men were calling out the larger fish with prolonged\r\nshouts, which sounded as though they came from gigantic\r\nspeaking-trumpets; and there was one individual who roared \u201CMussels!\r\nMussels!\u201D in such a hoarse, cracked, clamorous voice that the very\r\nroofs of the market shook. Some sacks of mussels were turned upside\r\ndown, and their contents poured into hampers, while others were emptied\r\nwith shovels. And there was a ceaseless procession of basket-trays\r\ncontaining skate, soles, mackerel, conger-eels, and salmon, carried\r\nbackwards and forwards amidst the ever-increasing cackle and pushing of\r\nthe fish-women as they crowded against the iron rails which creaked\r\nwith their pressure. The humpbacked crier, now fairly on the job, waved\r\nhis skinny arms in the air and protruded his jaws. Presently, seemingly\r\nlashed into a state of frenzy by the flood of figures that spurted from\r\nhis lips, he sprang upon a stool, where, with his mouth twisted\r\nspasmodically and his hair streaming behind him, he could force nothing\r\nmore than unintelligible hisses from his parched throat. And in the\r\nmeantime, up above, the collector of municipal dues, a little old man,\r\nmuffled in a collar of imitation astrachan, remained with nothing but\r\nhis nose showing under his black velvet skullcap. And the tall,\r\ndark-complexioned female clerk, with eyes shining calmly in her face,\r\nwhich had been slightly reddened by the cold, sat on her high wooden\r\nchair, quietly writing, apparently unruffled by the continuous rattle\r\nwhich came from the hunchback below her.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat fellow Logre is wonderful,\u201D muttered Monsieur Verlaque with a\r\nsmile. \u201CHe is the best crier in the markets. I believe he could make\r\npeople buy boot soles in the belief they were fish!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he and Florent went back into the pavilion. As they again passed\r\nthe spot where the fresh water fish was being sold by auction, and\r\nwhere the bidding seemed much quieter, Monsieur Verlaque explained that\r\nFrench river fishing was in a bad way.[*] The crier here, a fair,\r\nsorry-looking fellow, who scarcely moved his arms, was disposing of\r\nsome lots of eels and crawfish in a monotonous voice, while the\r\nassistants fished fresh supplies out of the stone basins with their\r\nshort-handled nets.\r\n\r\n[*] M. Zola refers, of course, to the earlier years of the Second\r\nEmpire. Under the present republican Government, which has largely\r\nfostered fish culture, matters have considerably improved.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the crowd round the salesmen\u2019s desks was still increasing.\r\nMonsieur Verlaque played his part as Florent\u2019s instructor in the most\r\nconscientious manner, clearing the way by means of his elbows, and\r\nguiding his successor through the busiest parts. The upper-class retail\r\ndealers were there, quietly waiting for some of the finer fish, or\r\nloading the porters with their purchases of turbot, tunny, and salmon.\r\nThe street-hawkers who had clubbed together to buy lots of herrings and\r\nsmall flat-fish were dividing them on the pavement. There were also\r\nsome people of the smaller middle class, from distant parts of the\r\ncity, who had come down at four o\u2019clock in the morning to buy a really\r\nfresh fish, and had ended by allowing some enormous lot, costing from\r\nforty to fifty francs, to be knocked down to them, with the result that\r\nthey would be obliged to spend the whole day in getting their friends\r\nand acquaintances to take the surplus off their hands. Every now and\r\nthen some violent pushing would force a gap through part of the crowd.\r\nA fish-wife, who had got tightly jammed, freed herself, shaking her\r\nfists and pouring out a torrent of abuse. Then a compact mass of people\r\nagain collected, and Florent, almost suffocated, declared that he had\r\nseen quite enough, and understood all that was necessary.\r\n\r\nAs Monsieur Verlaque was helping him to extricate himself from the\r\ncrowd, they found themselves face to face with the handsome Norman. She\r\nremained stock-still in front of them, and with her queenly air\r\ninquired:\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, is it quite settled? You are going to desert us, Monsieur\r\nVerlaque?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, yes,\u201D replied the little man; \u201CI am going to take a rest in the\r\ncountry, at Clamart. The smell of the fish is bad for me, it seems.\r\nHere, this is the gentleman who is going to take my place.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo speaking he turned round to introduce Florent to her. The handsome\r\nNorman almost choked; however, as Florent went off, he fancied he could\r\nhear her whisper to her neighbours, with a laugh: \u201CWell, we shall have\r\nsome fine fun now, see if we don\u2019t!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe fish-wives had begun to set out their stalls. From all the taps at\r\nthe corners of the marble slabs water was gushing freely; and there was\r\na rustling sound all round, like the plashing of rain, a streaming of\r\nstiff jets of water hissing and spurting. And then, from the lower side\r\nof the sloping slabs, great drops fell with a softened murmur,\r\nsplashing on the flagstones where a mass of tiny streams flowed along\r\nhere and there, turning holes and depressions into miniature lakes, and\r\nafterwards gliding in a thousand rills down the slope towards the Rue\r\nRambuteau. A moist haze ascended, a sort of rainy dust, bringing fresh\r\nwhiffs of air to Florent\u2019s face, whiffs of that salt, pungent sea\r\nbreeze which he remembered so well; while in such fish as was already\r\nlaid out he once more beheld the rosy nacres, gleaming corals, and\r\nmilky pearls, all the rippling colour and glaucous pallidity of the\r\nocean world.\r\n\r\nThat first morning left him much in doubt; indeed, he regretted that he\r\nhad yielded to Lisa\u2019s insistence. Ever since his escape from the greasy\r\ndrowsiness of the kitchen he had been accusing himself of base weakness\r\nwith such violence that tears had almost risen in his eyes. But he did\r\nnot dare to go back on his word. He was a little afraid of Lisa, and\r\ncould see the curl of her lips and the look of mute reproach upon her\r\nhandsome face. He felt that she was too serious a woman to be trifled\r\nwith. However, Gavard happily inspired him with a consoling thought. On\r\nthe evening of the day on which Monsieur Verlaque had conducted him\r\nthrough the auction sales, Gavard took him aside and told him, with a\r\ngood deal of hesitation, that \u201Cthe poor devil\u201D was not at all well off.\r\nAnd after various remarks about the scoundrelly Government which ground\r\nthe life out of its servants without allowing them even the means to\r\ndie in comfort, he ended by hinting that it would be charitable on\r\nFlorent\u2019s part to surrender a part of his salary to the old inspector.\r\nFlorent welcomed the suggestion with delight. It was only right, he\r\nconsidered, for he looked upon himself simply as Monsieur Verlaque\u2019s\r\ntemporary substitute; and besides, he himself really required nothing,\r\nas he boarded and lodged with his brother. Gavard added that he thought\r\nif Florent gave up fifty francs out of the hundred and fifty which he\r\nwould receive monthly, the arrangement would be everything that could\r\nbe desired; and, lowering his voice, he added that it would not be for\r\nlong, for the poor fellow was consumptive to his very bones. Finally it\r\nwas settled that Florent should see Monsieur Verlaque\u2019s wife, and\r\narrange matters with her, to avoid any possibility of hurting the old\r\nman\u2019s feelings.\r\n\r\nThe thought of this kindly action afforded Florent great relief, and he\r\nnow accepted his duties with the object of doing good, thus continuing\r\nto play the part which he had been fulfilling all his life. However, he\r\nmade the poultry dealer promise that he would not speak of the matter\r\nto anyone; and as Gavard also felt a vague fear of Lisa, he kept the\r\nsecret, which was really very meritorious in him.\r\n\r\nAnd now the whole pork shop seemed happy. Handsome Lisa manifested the\r\ngreatest friendliness towards her brother-in-law. She took care that he\r\nwent to bed early, so as to be able to rise in good time; she kept his\r\nbreakfast hot for him; and she no longer felt ashamed at being seen\r\ntalking to him on the footway, now that he wore a laced cap. Quenu,\r\nquite delighted by all these good signs, sat down to table in the\r\nevening between his wife and brother with a lighter heart than ever.\r\nThey often lingered over dinner till nine o\u2019clock, leaving the shop in\r\nAugustine\u2019s charge, and indulging in a leisurely digestion interspersed\r\nwith gossip about the neighbourhood, and the dogmatic opinions of Lisa\r\non political topics; Florent also had to relate how matters had gone in\r\nthe fish market that day. He gradually grew less frigid, and began to\r\ntaste the happiness of a well-regulated existence. There was a\r\nwell-to-do comfort and trimness about the light yellowish dining room\r\nwhich had a softening influence upon him as soon as he crossed its\r\nthreshold. Handsome Lisa\u2019s kindly attentions wrapped him, as it were,\r\nin cotton-wool; and mutual esteem and concord reigned paramount.\r\n\r\nGavard, however, considered the Quenu-Gradelles\u2019 home to be too drowsy.\r\nHe forgave Lisa her weakness for the Emperor, because, he said, one\r\nought never to discuss politics with women, and beautiful Madame Quenu\r\nwas, after all, a very worthy person, who managed her business\r\nadmirably. Nevertheless, he much preferred to spend his evenings at\r\nMonsieur Lebigre\u2019s, where he met a group of friends who shared his own\r\nopinions. Thus when Florent was appointed to the inspectorship of the\r\nfish market, Gavard began to lead him astray, taking him off for hours,\r\nand prompting him to lead a bachelor\u2019s life now that he had obtained a\r\nberth.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lebigre was the proprietor of a very fine establishment,\r\nfitted up in the modern luxurious style. Occupying the right-hand\r\ncorner of the Rue Pirouette, and looking on to the Rue Rambuteau, it\r\nformed, with its four small Norwegian pines in green-painted tubs\r\nflanking the doorway, a worthy pendant to the big pork shop of the\r\nQuenu-Gradelles. Through the clear glass windows you could see the\r\ninterior, which was decorated with festoons of foliage, vine branches,\r\nand grapes, painted on a soft green ground. The floor was tiled with\r\nlarge black and white squares. At the far end was the yawning cellar\r\nentrance, above which rose a spiral staircase hung with red drapery,\r\nand leading to the billiard-room on the first floor. The counter or\r\n\u201Cbar\u201D on the right looked especially rich, and glittered like polished\r\nsilver. Its zinc-work, hanging with a broad bulging border over the\r\nsub-structure of white and red marble, edged it with a rippling sheet\r\nof metal as if it were some high altar laden with embroidery. At one\r\nend, over a gas stove, stood porcelain pots, decorated with circles of\r\nbrass, and containing punch and hot wine. At the other extremity was a\r\ntall and richly sculptured marble fountain, from which a fine stream of\r\nwater, so steady and continuous that it looked as though it were\r\nmotionless, flowed into a basin. In the centre, edged on three sides by\r\nthe sloping zinc surface of the counter, was a second basin for rinsing\r\nand cooling purposes, where quart bottles of draught wine, partially\r\nempty, reared their greenish necks. Then on the counter, to the right\r\nand left of this central basin, were batches of glasses symmetrically\r\narranged: little glasses for brandy, thick tumblers for draught wine,\r\ncup glasses for brandied fruits, glasses for absinthe, glass mugs for\r\nbeer, and tall goblets, all turned upside down and reflecting the\r\nglitter of the counter. On the left, moreover, was a metal urn, serving\r\nas a receptacle for gratuities; whilst a similar one on the right\r\nbristled with a fan-like arrangement of coffee spoons.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lebigre was generally to be found enthroned behind his counter\r\nupon a seat covered with buttoned crimson leather. Within easy reach of\r\nhis hand were the liqueurs in cut-glass decanters protruding from the\r\ncompartments of a stand. His round back rested against a huge mirror\r\nwhich completely filled the panel behind him; across it ran two glass\r\nshelves supporting an array of jars and bottles. Upon one of them the\r\nglass jars of preserved fruits, cherries, plums, and peaches, stood out\r\ndarkly; while on the other, between symmetrically arranged packets of\r\nfinger biscuits, were bright flasks of soft green and red and yellow\r\nglass, suggesting strange mysterious liqueurs, or floral extracts of\r\nexquisite limpidity. Standing on the glass shelf in the white glow of\r\nthe mirror, these flasks, flashing as if on fire, seemed to be\r\nsuspended in the air.\r\n\r\nTo give his premises the appearance of a caf\u00E9, Monsieur Lebigre had\r\nplaced two small tables of bronzed iron and four chairs against the\r\nwall, in front of the counter. A chandelier with five lights and\r\nfrosted globes hung down from the ceiling. On the left was a round gilt\r\ntimepiece, above a _tourniquet_[*] fixed to the wall. Then at the far\r\nend came the private \u201Ccabinet,\u201D a corner of the shop shut off by a\r\npartition glazed with frosted glass of a small square pattern. In the\r\ndaytime this little room received a dim light from a window that looked\r\non to the Rue Pirouette; and in the evening, a gas jet burnt over the\r\ntwo tables painted to resemble marble. It was there that Gavard and his\r\npolitical friends met each evening after dinner. They looked upon\r\nthemselves as being quite at home there, and had prevailed on the\r\nlandlord to reserve the place for them. When Monsieur Lebigre had\r\nclosed the door of the glazed partition, they knew themselves to be so\r\nsafely screened from intrusion that they spoke quite unreservedly of\r\nthe great \u201Csweep out\u201D which they were fond of discussing. No\r\nunprivileged customer would have dared to enter.\r\n\r\n[*] This is a kind of dial turning on a pivot, and usually enclosed in\r\na brass frame, from which radiate a few small handles or spokes. Round\r\nthe face of the dial\u2014usually of paper\u2014are various numerals, and between\r\nthe face and its glass covering is a small marble or wooden ball. The\r\nappliance is used in lieu of dice or coins when two or more customers\r\nare \u201Ctossing\u201D for drinks. Each in turn sends the dial spinning round,\r\nand wins or loses according to the numeral against which the ball rests\r\nwhen the dial stops. As I can find no English name for the appliance, I\r\nhave thought it best to describe it.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first day that Gavard took Florent off he gave him some\r\nparticulars of Monsieur Lebigre. He was a good fellow, he said, who\r\nsometimes came to drink his coffee with them; and, as he had said one\r\nday that he had fought in \u201848, no one felt the least constraint in his\r\npresence. He spoke but little, and seemed rather thick-headed. As the\r\ngentlemen passed him on their way to the private room they grasped his\r\nhand in silence across the glasses and bottles. By his side on the\r\ncrimson leather seat behind the counter there was generally a fair\r\nlittle woman, whom he had engaged as counter assistant in addition to\r\nthe white-aproned waiter who attended to the tables and the\r\nbilliard-room. The young woman\u2019s name was Rose, and she seemed a very\r\ngentle and submissive being. Gavard, with a wink of his eye, told\r\nFlorent that he fancied Lebigre had a weakness for her. It was she, by\r\nthe way, who waited upon the friends in the private room, coming and\r\ngoing, with her happy, humble air, amidst the stormiest political\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nUpon the day on which the poultry dealer took Florent to Lebigre\u2019s to\r\npresent him to his friends, the only person whom the pair found in the\r\nlittle room when they entered it was a man of some fifty years of age,\r\nof a mild and thoughtful appearance. He wore a rather shabby-looking\r\nhat and a long chestnut-coloured overcoat, and sat, with his chin\r\nresting on the ivory knob of a thick cane, in front of a glass mug full\r\nof beer. His mouth was so completely concealed by a vigorous growth of\r\nbeard that his face had a dumb, lipless appearance.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow are you, Robine?\u201D exclaimed Gavard.\r\n\r\nRobine silently thrust out his hand, without making any reply, though\r\nhis eyes softened into a slight smile of welcome. Then he let his chin\r\ndrop on to the knob of his cane again, and looked at Florent over his\r\nbeer. Florent had made Gavard swear to keep his story a secret for fear\r\nof some dangerous indiscretion; and he was not displeased to observe a\r\ntouch of distrust in the discreet demeanour of the gentleman with the\r\nheavy beard. However, he was really mistaken in this, for Robine never\r\ntalked more than he did now. He was always the first to arrive, just as\r\nthe clock struck eight; and he always sat in the same corner, never\r\nletting go his hold of his cane, and never taking off either his hat or\r\nhis overcoat. No one had ever seen him without his hat upon his head.\r\nHe remained there listening to the talk of the others till midnight,\r\ntaking four hours to empty his mug of beer, and gazing successively at\r\nthe different speakers as though he heard them with his eyes. When\r\nFlorent afterwards questioned Gavard about Robine, the poultry dealer\r\nspoke of the latter as though he held him in high esteem. Robine, he\r\nasserted, was an extremely clever and able man, and, though he was\r\nunable to say exactly where he had given proof of his hostility to the\r\nestablished order of things, he declared that he was one of the most\r\ndreaded of the Government\u2019s opponents. He lived in the Rue Saint Denis,\r\nin rooms to which no one as a rule could gain admission. The poultry\r\ndealer, however, asserted that he himself had once been in them. The\r\nwax floors, he said, were protected by strips of green linen; and there\r\nwere covers over the furniture, and an alabaster timepiece with\r\ncolumns. He had caught a glimpse of the back of a lady, who was just\r\ndisappearing through one doorway as he was entering by another, and had\r\ntaken her to be Madame Robine. She appeared to be an old lady of very\r\ngenteel appearance, with her hair arranged in corkscrew curls; but of\r\nthis he could not be quite certain. No one knew why they had taken up\r\ntheir abode amidst all the uproar of a business neighbourhood; for the\r\nhusband did nothing at all, spending his days no one knew how and\r\nliving on no one knew what, though he made his appearance every evening\r\nas though he were tired but delighted with some excursion into the\r\nhighest regions of politics.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, have you read the speech from the throne?\u201D asked Gavard, taking\r\nup a newspaper that was lying on the table.\r\n\r\nRobine shrugged his shoulders. Just at that moment, however, the door\r\nof the glazed partition clattered noisily, and a hunchback made his\r\nappearance. Florent at once recognised the deformed crier of the fish\r\nmarket, though his hands were now washed and he was neatly dressed,\r\nwith his neck encircled by a great red muffler, one end of which hung\r\ndown over his hump like the skirt of a Venetian cloak.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, here\u2019s Logre!\u201D exclaimed the poultry dealer. \u201CNow we shall hear\r\nwhat he thinks about the speech from the throne.\u201D\r\n\r\nLogre, however, was apparently furious. To begin with he almost broke\r\nthe pegs off in hanging up his hat and muffler. Then he threw himself\r\nviolently into a chair, and brought his fist down on the table, while\r\ntossing away the newspaper.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you think I read their fearful lies?\u201D he cried.\r\n\r\nThen he gave vent to the anger raging within him. \u201CDid ever anyone\r\nhear,\u201D he cried, \u201Cof masters making such fools of their people? For two\r\nwhole hours I\u2019ve been waiting for my pay! There were ten of us in the\r\noffice kicking our heels there. Then at last Monsieur Manoury arrived\r\nin a cab. Where he had come from I don\u2019t know, and don\u2019t care, but I\u2019m\r\nquite sure it wasn\u2019t any respectable place. Those salesmen are all a\r\nparcel of thieves and libertines! And then, too, the hog actually gave\r\nme all my money in small change!\u201D\r\n\r\nRobine expressed his sympathy with Logre by the slight movement of his\r\neyelids. But suddenly the hunchback bethought him of a victim upon whom\r\nto pour out his wrath. \u201CRose! Rose!\u201D he cried, stretching his head out\r\nof the little room.\r\n\r\nThe young woman quickly responded to the call, trembling all over.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D shouted Logre, \u201Cwhat do you stand staring at me like that for?\r\nMuch good that\u2019ll do! You saw me come in, didn\u2019t you? Why haven\u2019t you\r\nbrought me my glass of black coffee, then?\u201D\r\n\r\nGavard ordered two similar glasses, and Rose made all haste to bring\r\nwhat was required, while Logre glared sternly at the glasses and little\r\nsugar trays as if studying them. When he had taken a drink he seemed to\r\ngrow somewhat calmer.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut it\u2019s Charvet who must be getting bored,\u201D he said presently. \u201CHe is\r\nwaiting outside on the pavement for Clemence.\u201D\r\n\r\nCharvet, however, now made his appearance, followed by Clemence. He was\r\na tall, scraggy young man, carefully shaved, with a skinny nose and\r\nthin lips. He lived in the Rue Vavin, behind the Luxembourg, and called\r\nhimself a professor. In politics he was a disciple of H\u00E9bert.[*] He\r\nwore his hair very long, and the collar and lapels of his threadbare\r\nfrock-coat were broadly turned back. Affecting the manner and speech of\r\na member of the National Convention, he would pour out such a flood of\r\nbitter words and make such a haughty display of pedantic learning that\r\nhe generally crushed his adversaries. Gavard was afraid of him, though\r\nhe would not confess it; still, in Charvet\u2019s absence he would say that\r\nhe really went too far. Robine, for his part, expressed approval of\r\neverything with his eyes. Logre sometimes opposed Charvet on the\r\nquestion of salaries; but the other was really the autocrat of the\r\ncoterie, having the greatest fund of information and the most\r\noverbearing manner. For more than ten years he and Clemence had lived\r\ntogether as man and wife, in accordance with a previously arranged\r\ncontract, the terms of which were strictly observed by both parties to\r\nit. Florent looked at the young woman with some little surprise, but at\r\nlast he recollected where he had previously seen her. This was at the\r\nfish auction. She was, indeed, none other than the tall dark female\r\nclerk whom he had observed writing with outstretched fingers, after the\r\nmanner of one who had been carefully instructed in the art of holding a\r\npen.\r\n\r\n[*] H\u00E9bert, as the reader will remember, was the furious demagogue with\r\nthe foul tongue and poisoned pen who edited the _P\u00E8re Duchesne_ at the\r\ntime of the first French Revolution. We had a revival of his politics\r\nand his journal in Paris during the Commune of 1871.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nRose made her appearance at the heels of the two newcomers. Without\r\nsaying a word she placed a mug of beer before Charvet and a tray before\r\nClemence, who in a leisurely way began to compound a glass of \u201Cgrog,\u201D\r\npouring some hot water over a slice of lemon, which she crushed with\r\nher spoon, and glancing carefully at the decanter as she poured out\r\nsome rum, so as not to add more of it than a small liqueur glass could\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\nGavard now presented Florent to the company, but more especially to\r\nCharvet. He introduced them to one another as professors, and very able\r\nmen, who would be sure to get on well together. But it was probable\r\nthat he had already been guilty of some indiscretion, for all the men\r\nat once shook hands with a tight and somewhat masonic squeeze of each\r\nother\u2019s fingers. Charvet, for his part, showed himself almost amiable;\r\nand whether he and the others knew anything of Florent\u2019s antecedents,\r\nthey at all events indulged in no embarrassing allusions.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid Manoury pay you in small change?\u201D Logre asked Clemence.\r\n\r\nShe answered affirmatively, and produced a roll of francs and another\r\nof two-franc pieces, and unwrapped them. Charvet watched her, and his\r\neyes followed the rolls as she replaced them in her pocket, after\r\ncounting their contents and satisfying herself that they were correct.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe have our accounts to settle,\u201D he said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, we\u2019ll settle up to-night,\u201D the young woman replied. \u201CBut we are\r\nabout even, I should think. I\u2019ve breakfasted with you four times,\r\nhaven\u2019t I? But I lent you a hundred sous last week, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent, surprised at hearing this, discreetly turned his head away.\r\nThen Clemence slipped the last roll of silver into her pocket, drank a\r\nlittle of her grog, and, leaning against the glazed partition, quietly\r\nsettled herself down to listen to the men talking politics. Gavard had\r\ntaken up the newspaper again, and, in tones which he strove to render\r\ncomic, was reading out some passages of the speech from the throne\r\nwhich had been delivered that morning at the opening of the Chambers.\r\nCharvet made fine sport of the official phraseology; there was not a\r\nsingle line of it which he did not tear to pieces. One sentence\r\nafforded especial amusement to them all. It was this: \u201CWe are\r\nconfident, gentlemen, that, leaning on your lights[*] and the\r\nconservative sentiments of the country, we shall succeed in increasing\r\nthe national prosperity day by day.\u201D\r\n\r\n[*] In the sense of illumination of mind. It has been necessary to give\r\na literal translation of this phrase to enable the reader to realise\r\nthe point of subsequent witticisms in which Clemence and Gavard\r\nindulge. \u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nLogre rose up and repeated this sentence, and by speaking through his\r\nnose succeeded fairly well in mimicking the Emperor\u2019s drawling voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s lovely, that prosperity of his; why, everyone\u2019s dying of hunger!\u201D\r\nsaid Charvet.\r\n\r\n\u201CTrade is shocking,\u201D asserted Gavard.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what in the name of goodness is the meaning of anybody \u2018leaning on\r\nlights\u2019?\u201D continued Clemence, who prided herself upon literary culture.\r\n\r\nRobine himself even allowed a faint laugh to escape from the depths of\r\nhis beard. The discussion began to grow warm. The party fell foul of\r\nthe Corps L\u00E9gislatif, and spoke of it with great severity. Logre did\r\nnot cease ranting, and Florent found him the same as when he cried the\r\nfish at the auctions\u2014protruding his jaws and hurling his words forward\r\nwith a wave of the arm, whilst retaining the crouching attitude of a\r\nsnarling dog. Indeed, he talked politics in just the same furious\r\nmanner as he offered a tray full of soles for sale.\r\n\r\nCharvet, on the other hand, became quieter and colder amidst the smoke\r\nof the pipes and the fumes of the gas which were now filling the little\r\nden; and his voice assumed a dry incisive tone, sharp like a guillotine\r\nblade, while Robine gently wagged his head without once removing his\r\nchin from the ivory knob of his cane. However, some remark of Gavard\u2019s\r\nled the conversation to the subject of women.\r\n\r\n\u201CWoman,\u201D declared Charvet drily, \u201Cis the equal of man; and, that being\r\nso, she ought not to inconvenience him in the management of his life.\r\nMarriage is a partnership, in which everything should be halved. Isn\u2019t\r\nthat so, Clemence?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CClearly so,\u201D replied the young woman, leaning back with her head\r\nagainst the wall and gazing into the air.\r\n\r\nHowever, Florent now saw Lacaille, the costermonger, and Alexandre, the\r\nporter, Claude Lantier\u2019s friend, come into the little room. In the past\r\nthese two had long remained at the other table in the sanctum; they did\r\nnot belong to the same class as the others. By the help of politics,\r\nhowever, their chairs had drawn nearer, and they had ended by forming\r\npart of the circle. Charvet, in whose eyes they represented \u201Cthe\r\npeople,\u201D did his best to indoctrinate them with his advanced political\r\ntheories, while Gavard played the part of the shopkeeper free from all\r\nsocial prejudices by clinking glasses with them. Alexandre was a\r\ncheerful, good-humoured giant, with the manner of a big merry lad.\r\nLacaille, on the other hand, was embittered; his hair was already\r\ngrizzling; and, bent and wearied by his ceaseless perambulations\r\nthrough the streets of Paris, he would at times glance loweringly at\r\nthe placid figure of Robine, and his sound boots and heavy coat.\r\n\r\nThat evening both Lacaille and Alexandre called for a liqueur glass of\r\nbrandy, and then the conversation was renewed with increased warmth and\r\nexcitement, the party being now quite complete. A little later, while\r\nthe door of the cabinet was left ajar, Florent caught sight of\r\nMademoiselle Saget standing in front of the counter. She had taken a\r\nbottle from under her apron, and was watching Rose as the latter poured\r\ninto it a large measureful of black-currant syrup and a smaller one of\r\nbrandy. Then the bottle disappeared under the apron again, and\r\nMademoiselle Saget, with her hands out of sight, remained talking in\r\nthe bright glow of the counter, face to face with the big mirror, in\r\nwhich the flasks and bottles of liqueurs were reflected like rows of\r\nVenetian lanterns. In the evening all the metal and glass of the\r\nestablishment helped to illuminate it with wonderful brilliancy. The\r\nold maid, standing there in her black skirts, looked almost like some\r\nbig strange insect amidst all the crude brightness. Florent noticed\r\nthat she was trying to inveigle Rose into a conversation, and shrewdly\r\nsuspected that she had caught sight of him through the half open\r\ndoorway. Since he had been on duty at the markets he had met her at\r\nalmost every step, loitering in one or another of the covered ways, and\r\ngenerally in the company of Madame Lec\u0153ur and La Sarriette. He had\r\nnoticed also that the three women stealthily examined him, and seemed\r\nlost in amazement at seeing him installed in the position of inspector.\r\nThat evening, however, Rose was no doubt loath to enter into\r\nconversation with the old maid, for the latter at last turned round,\r\napparently with the intention of approaching Monsieur Lebigre, who was\r\nplaying piquet with a customer at one of the bronzed tables. Creeping\r\nquietly along, Mademoiselle Saget had at last managed to install\r\nherself beside the partition of the cabinet, when she was observed by\r\nGavard, who detested her.\r\n\r\n\u201CShut the door, Florent!\u201D he cried unceremoniously. \u201CWe can\u2019t even be\r\nby ourselves, it seems!\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen midnight came and Lacaille went away he exchanged a few whispered\r\nwords with Monsieur Lebigre, and as the latter shook hands with him he\r\nslipped four five-franc pieces into his palm, without anyone noticing\r\nit. \u201CThat\u2019ll make twenty-two francs that you\u2019ll have to pay to-morrow,\r\nremember,\u201D he whispered in his ear. \u201CThe person who lends the money\r\nwon\u2019t do it for less in future. Don\u2019t forget, too, that you owe three\r\ndays\u2019 truck hire. You must pay everything off.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Monsieur Lebigre wished the friends good night. He was very sleepy\r\nand should sleep well, he said, with a yawn which revealed his big\r\nteeth, while Rose gazed at him with an air of submissive humility.\r\nHowever, he gave her a push, and told her to go and turn out the gas in\r\nthe little room.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the pavement, Gavard stumbled and nearly fell. And being in\r\na humorous vein, he thereupon exclaimed: \u201CConfound it all! At any rate,\r\nI don\u2019t seem to be leaning on anybody\u2019s lights.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis remark seemed to amuse the others, and the party broke up. A\r\nlittle later Florent returned to Lebigre\u2019s, and indeed he became quite\r\nattached to the \u201Ccabinet,\u201D finding a seductive charm in Robine\u2019s\r\ncontemplative silence, Logre\u2019s fiery outbursts, and Charvet\u2019s cool\r\nvenom. When he went home, he did not at once retire to bed. He had\r\ngrown very fond of his attic, that girlish bedroom, where Augustine had\r\nleft scraps of ribbons, souvenirs, and other feminine trifles lying\r\nabout. There still remained some hair-pins on the mantelpiece, with\r\ngilt cardboard boxes of buttons and lozenges, cutout pictures, and\r\nempty pomade pots that retained an odour of jasmine. Then there were\r\nsome reels of thread, needles, and a missal lying by the side of a\r\nsoiled Dream-book in the drawer of the rickety deal table. A white\r\nsummer dress with yellow spots hung forgotten from a nail; while upon\r\nthe board which served as a toilet-table a big stain behind the\r\nwater-jug showed where a bottle of bandoline had been overturned. The\r\nlittle chamber, with its narrow iron bed, its two rush-bottomed chairs,\r\nand its faded grey wallpaper, was instinct with innocent simplicity.\r\nThe plain white curtains, the childishness suggested by the cardboard\r\nboxes and the Dream-book, and the clumsy coquetry which had stained the\r\nwalls, all charmed Florent and brought him back to dreams of youth. He\r\nwould have preferred not to have known that plain, wiry-haired\r\nAugustine, but to have been able to imagine that he was occupying the\r\nroom of a sister, some bright sweet girl of whose budding womanhood\r\nevery trifle around him spoke.\r\n\r\nYet another pleasure which he took was to lean out of the garret window\r\nat nighttime. In front of it was a narrow ledge of roof, enclosed by an\r\niron railing, and forming a sort of balcony, on which Augustine had\r\ngrown a pomegranate in a box. Since the nights had turned cold, Florent\r\nhad brought the pomegranate indoors and kept it by the foot of his bed\r\ntill morning. He would linger for a few minutes by the open window,\r\ninhaling deep draughts of the sharp fresh air which was wafted up from\r\nthe Seine, over the housetops of the Rue de Rivoli. Below him the roofs\r\nof the markets spread confusedly in a grey expanse, like slumbering\r\nlakes on whose surface the furtive reflection of a pane of glass\r\ngleamed every now and then like a silvery ripple. Farther away the\r\nroofs of the meat and poultry pavilions lay in deeper gloom, and became\r\nmere masses of shadow barring the horizon. Florent delighted in the\r\ngreat stretch of open sky in front of him, in that spreading expanse of\r\nthe markets which amidst all the narrow city streets brought him a dim\r\nvision of some strip of sea coast, of the still grey waters of a bay\r\nscarce quivering from the roll of the distant billows. He used to lose\r\nhimself in dreams as he stood there; each night he conjured up the\r\nvision of some fresh coast line. To return in mind to the eight years\r\nof despair which he had spent away from France rendered him both very\r\nsad and very happy. Then at last, shivering all over, he would close\r\nthe window. Often, as he stood in front of the fireplace taking off his\r\ncollar, the photograph of Auguste and Augustine would fill him with\r\ndisquietude. They seemed to be watching him as they stood there, hand\r\nin hand, smiling faintly.\r\n\r\nFlorent\u2019s first few weeks at the fish market were very painful to him.\r\nThe Mehudins treated him with open hostility, which infected the whole\r\nmarket with a spirit of opposition. The beautiful Norman intended to\r\nrevenge herself on the handsome Lisa, and the latter\u2019s cousin seemed a\r\nvictim ready to hand.\r\n\r\nThe Mehudins came from Rouen. Louise\u2019s mother still related how she had\r\nfirst arrived in Paris with a basket of eels. She had ever afterwards\r\nremained in the fish trade. She had married a man employed in the\r\nOctroi service, who had died leaving her with two little girls. It was\r\nshe who by her full figure and glowing freshness had won for herself in\r\nearlier days the nickname of \u201Cthe beautiful Norman,\u201D which her eldest\r\ndaughter had inherited. Now five and sixty years of age, Madame Mehudin\r\nhad become flabby and shapeless, and the damp air of the fish market\r\nhad rendered her voice rough and hoarse, and given a bluish tinge to\r\nher skin. Sedentary life had made her extremely bulky, and her head was\r\nthrown backwards by the exuberance of her bosom. She had never been\r\nwilling to renounce the fashions of her younger days, but still wore\r\nthe flowered gown, the yellow kerchief, and turban-like head-gear of\r\nthe classic fish-wife, besides retaining the latter\u2019s loud voice and\r\nrapidity of gesture as she stood with her hands on her hips, shouting\r\nout the whole abusive vocabulary of her calling.\r\n\r\nShe looked back regretfully to the old March\u00E9 des Innocents, which the\r\nnew central markets had supplanted. She would talk of the ancient\r\nrights of the market \u201Cladies,\u201D and mingle stories of fisticuffs\r\nexchanged with the police with reminiscences of the visits she had paid\r\nthe Court in the time of Charles X and Louis Philippe, dressed in silk,\r\nand carrying a bouquet of flowers in her hand. Old Mother Mehudin, as\r\nshe was now generally called, had for a long time been the\r\nbanner-bearer of the Sisterhood of the Virgin at St. Leu. She would\r\nrelate that in the processions in the church there she had worn a dress\r\nand cap of tulle trimmed with satin ribbons, whilst holding aloft in\r\nher puffy fingers the gilded staff of the richly-fringed silk standard\r\non which the figure of the Holy Mother was embroidered.\r\n\r\nAccording to the gossip of the neighbourhood, the old woman had made a\r\nfairly substantial fortune, though the only signs of it were the\r\nmassive gold ornaments with which she loaded her neck and arms and\r\nbosom on important occasions. Her two daughters got on badly together\r\nas they grew up. The younger one, Claire, an idle, fair-complexioned\r\ngirl, complained of the ill-treatment which she received from her\r\nsister Louise, protesting, in her languid voice, that she could never\r\nsubmit to be the other\u2019s servant. As they would certainly have ended by\r\ncoming to blows, their mother separated them. She gave her stall in the\r\nfish market to Louise, while Claire, whom the smell of the skate and\r\nthe herrings affected in the lungs, installed herself among the fresh\r\nwater fish. And from that time the old mother, although she pretended\r\nto have retired from business altogether, would flit from one stall to\r\nthe other, still interfering in the selling of the fish, and causing\r\nher daughters continual annoyance by the foul insolence with which she\r\nwould at times speak to customers.\r\n\r\nClaire was a fantastical creature, very gentle in her manner, and yet\r\ncontinually at loggerheads with others. People said that she invariably\r\nfollowed her own whimsical inclinations. In spite of her dreamy,\r\ngirlish face she was imbued with a nature of silent firmness, a spirit\r\nof independence which prompted her to live apart; she never took things\r\nas other people did, but would one day evince perfect fairness, and the\r\nnext day arrant injustice. She would sometimes throw the market into\r\nconfusion by suddenly increasing or lowering the prices at her stall,\r\nwithout anyone being able to guess her reason for doing so. She herself\r\nwould refuse to explain her motive. By the time she reached her\r\nthirtieth year, her delicate physique and fine skin, which the water of\r\nthe tanks seemed to keep continually fresh and soft, her small,\r\nfaintly-marked face and lissome limbs would probably become heavy,\r\ncoarse, and flabby, till she would look like some faded saint that had\r\nstepped from a stained-glass window into the degrading sphere of the\r\nmarkets. At twenty-two, however, Claire, in the midst of her carp and\r\neels, was, to use Claude Lantier\u2019s expression, a Murillo. A Murillo,\r\nthat is, whose hair was often in disorder, who wore heavy shoes and\r\nclumsily cut dresses, which left her without any figure. But she was\r\nfree from all coquetry, and she assumed an air of scornful contempt\r\nwhen Louise, displaying her bows and ribbons, chaffed her about her\r\nclumsily knotted neckerchiefs. Moreover, she was virtuous; it was said\r\nthat the son of a rich shopkeeper in the neighbourhood had gone abroad\r\nin despair at having failed to induce her to listen to his suit.\r\n\r\nLouise, the beautiful Norman, was of a different nature. She had been\r\nengaged to be married to a clerk in the corn market; but a sack of\r\nflour falling upon the young man had broken his back and killed him.\r\nNot very long afterwards Louise had given birth to a boy. In the\r\nMehudins\u2019 circle of acquaintance she was looked upon as a widow; and\r\nthe old fish-wife in conversation would occasionally refer to the time\r\nwhen her son-in-law was alive.\r\n\r\nThe Mehudins were a power in the markets. When Monsieur Verlaque had\r\nfinished instructing Florent in his new duties, he advised him to\r\nconciliate certain of the stall-holders, if he wished his life to be\r\nendurable; and he even carried his sympathy so far as to put him in\r\npossession of the little secrets of the office, such as the various\r\nlittle breaches of rule that it was necessary to wink at, and those at\r\nwhich he would have to feign stern displeasure; and also the\r\ncircumstances under which he might accept a small present. A market\r\ninspector is at once a constable and a magistrate; he has to maintain\r\nproper order and cleanliness, and settle in a conciliatory spirit all\r\ndisputes between buyers and sellers. Florent, who was of a weak\r\ndisposition put on an artificial sternness when he was obliged to\r\nexercise his authority, and generally over-acted his part. Moreover,\r\nhis gloomy, pariah-like face and bitterness of spirit, the result of\r\nlong suffering, were against him.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Norman\u2019s idea was to involve him in some quarrel or\r\nother. She had sworn that he would not keep his berth a fortnight.\r\n\u201CThat fat Lisa\u2019s much mistaken,\u201D said she one morning on meeting Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur, \u201Cif she thinks that she\u2019s going to put people over us. We don\u2019t\r\nwant such ugly wretches here. That sweetheart of hers is a perfect\r\nfright!\u201D\r\n\r\nAfter the auctions, when Florent commenced his round of inspection,\r\nstrolling slowly through the dripping alleys, he could plainly see the\r\nbeautiful Norman watching him with an impudent smile on her face. Her\r\nstall, which was in the second row on the left, near the fresh water\r\nfish department faced the Rue Rambuteau. She would turn round, however,\r\nand never take her eyes off her victim whilst making fun of him with\r\nher neighbours. And when he passed in front of her, slowly examining\r\nthe slabs, she feigned hilarious merriment, slapped her fish with her\r\nhand, and turned her jets of water on at full stream, flooding the\r\npathway. Nevertheless Florent remained perfectly calm.\r\n\r\nAt last, one morning as was bound to happen, war broke out. As Florent\r\nreached La Normande\u2019s stall that day an unbearable stench assailed his\r\nnostrils. On the marble slab, in addition to part of a magnificent\r\nsalmon, showing its soft roseate flesh, there lay some turbots of\r\ncreamy whiteness, a few conger-eels pierced with black pins to mark\r\ntheir divisions, several pairs of soles, and some bass and red\r\nmullet\u2014in fact, quite a display of fresh fish. But in the midst of it,\r\namongst all these fish whose eyes still gleamed and whose gills were of\r\na bright crimson, there lay a huge skate of a ruddy tinge, splotched\r\nwith dark stains\u2014superb, indeed, with all its strange colourings.\r\nUnfortunately, it was rotten; its tail was falling off and the ribs of\r\nits fins were breaking through the skin.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must throw that skate away,\u201D said Florent as he came up.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Norman broke into a slight laugh. Florent raised his eyes\r\nand saw her standing before him, with her back against the bronze lamp\r\npost which lighted the stalls in her division. She had mounted upon a\r\nbox to keep her feet out of the damp, and appeared very tall as he\r\nglanced at her. She looked also handsomer than usual, with her hair\r\narranged in little curls, her sly face slightly bent, her lips\r\ncompressed, and her hands showing somewhat too rosily against her big\r\nwhite apron. Florent had never before seen her decked with so much\r\njewellery. She had long pendants in her ears, a chain round her neck, a\r\nbrooch in her dress body, and quite a collection of rings on two\r\nfingers of her left hand and one of her right.\r\n\r\nAs she still continued to look slyly at Florent, without making any\r\nreply, the latter continued: \u201CDo you hear? You must remove that skate.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe had not yet noticed the presence of old Madame Mehudin, who sat all\r\nof a heap on a chair in a corner. She now got up, however, and, with\r\nher fists resting on the marble slap, insolently exclaimed: \u201CDear me!\r\nAnd why is she to throw her skate away? You won\u2019t pay her for it, I\u2019ll\r\nbet!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent immediately understood the position. The women at the other\r\nstalls began to titter, and he felt that he was surrounded by covert\r\nrebellion, which a word might cause to blaze forth. He therefore\r\nrestrained himself, and in person drew the refuse-pail from under the\r\nstall and dropped the skate into it. Old Madame Mehudin had already\r\nstuck her hands on her hips, while the beautiful Norman, who had not\r\nspoken a word, burst into another malicious laugh as Florent strode\r\nsternly away amidst a chorus of jeers, which he pretended not to hear.\r\n\r\nEach day now some new trick was played upon him, and he was obliged to\r\nwalk through the market alleys as warily as though he were in a hostile\r\ncountry. He was splashed with water from the sponges employed to\r\ncleanse the slabs; he stumbled and almost fell over slippery refuse\r\nintentionally spread in his way; and even the porters contrived to run\r\ntheir baskets against the nape of his neck. One day, moreover, when two\r\nof the fish-wives were quarrelling, and he hastened up to prevent them\r\ncoming to blows, he was obliged to duck in order to escape being\r\nslapped on either cheek by a shower of little dabs which passed over\r\nhis head. There was a general outburst of laughter on this occasion,\r\nand Florent always believed that the two fish-wives were in league with\r\nthe Mehudins. However, his old-time experiences as a teacher had\r\nendowed him with angelic patience, and he was able to maintain a\r\nmagisterial coolness of manner even when anger was hotly rising within\r\nhim, and his whole being quivered with a sense of humiliation. Still,\r\nthe young scamps of the Rue de l\u2019Estrapade had never manifested the\r\nsavagery of these fish-wives, the cruel tenacity of these huge females,\r\nwhose massive figures heaved and shook with a giant-like joy whenever\r\nhe fell into any trap. They stared him out of countenance with their\r\nred faces; and in the coarse tones of their voices and the impudent\r\ngesture of their hands he could read volumes of filthy abuse levelled\r\nat himself. Gavard would have been quite in his element amidst all\r\nthese petticoats, and would have freely cuffed them all round; but\r\nFlorent, who had always been afraid of women, gradually felt\r\noverwhelmed as by a sort of nightmare in which giant women, buxom\r\nbeyond all imagination, danced threateningly around him, shouting at\r\nhim in hoarse voices and brandishing bare arms, as massive as any\r\nprize-fighter\u2019s.\r\n\r\nAmongst this hoard of females, however, Florent had one friend. Claire\r\nunhesitatingly declared that the new inspector was a very good fellow.\r\nWhen he passed in front of her, pursued by the coarse abuse of the\r\nothers, she gave him a pleasant smile, sitting nonchalantly behind her\r\nstall, with unruly errant locks of pale hair straying over her neck and\r\nher brow, and the bodice of her dress pinned all askew. He also often\r\nsaw her dipping her hands into her tanks, transferring the fish from\r\none compartment to another, and amusing herself by turning on the brass\r\ntaps, shaped like little dolphins with open mouths, from which the\r\nwater poured in streamlets. Amidst the rustling sound of the water she\r\nhad some of the quivering grace of a girl who has just been bathing and\r\nhas hurriedly slipped on her clothes.\r\n\r\nOne morning she was particularly amiable. She called the inspector to\r\nher to show him a huge eel which had been the wonder of the market when\r\nexhibited at the auction. She opened the grating, which she had\r\npreviously closed over the basin in whose depths the eel seemed to be\r\nlying sound asleep.\r\n\r\n\u201CWait a moment,\u201D she said, \u201Cand I\u2019ll show it to you.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she gently slipped her bare arm into the water; it was not a very\r\nplump arm, and its veins showed softly blue beneath its satiny skin. As\r\nsoon as the eel felt her touch, it rapidly twisted round, and seemed to\r\nfill the narrow trough with its glistening greenish coils. And directly\r\nit had settled down to rest again Claire once more stirred it with her\r\nfingertips.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is an enormous creature,\u201D Florent felt bound to say. \u201CI have rarely\r\nseen such a fine one.\u201D\r\n\r\nClaire thereupon confessed to him that she had at first been frightened\r\nof eels; but now she had learned how to tighten her grip so that they\r\ncould not slip away. From another compartment she took a smaller one,\r\nwhich began to wriggle both with head and tail, as she held it about\r\nthe middle in her closed fist. This made her laugh. She let it go, then\r\nseized another and another, scouring the basin and stirring up the\r\nwhole heap of snaky-looking creatures with her slim fingers.\r\n\r\nAfterwards she began to speak of the slackness of trade. The hawkers on\r\nthe foot-pavement of the covered way did the regular saleswomen a great\r\ndeal of injury, she said. Meantime her bare arm, which she had not\r\nwiped, was glistening and dripping with water. Big drops trickled from\r\neach finger.\r\n\r\n\u201COh,\u201D she exclaimed suddenly, \u201CI must show you my carp, too!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe now removed another grating, and, using both hands, lifted out a\r\nlarge carp, which began to flap its tail and gasp. It was too big to be\r\nheld conveniently, so she sought another one. This was smaller, and she\r\ncould hold it with one hand, but the latter was forced slightly open by\r\nthe panting of the sides each time that the fish gasped. To amuse\r\nherself it occurred to Claire to pop the tip of her thumb into the\r\ncarp\u2019s mouth whilst it was dilated. \u201CIt won\u2019t bite,\u201D said she with her\r\ngentle laugh; \u201Cit\u2019s not spiteful. No more are the crawfishes; I\u2019m not\r\nthe least afraid of them.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe plunged her arm into the water again, and from a compartment full\r\nof a confused crawling mass brought up a crawfish that had caught her\r\nlittle finger in its claws. She gave the creature a shake, but it no\r\ndoubt gripped her too tightly, for she turned very red, and snapped off\r\nits claw with a quick, angry gesture, though still continuing to smile.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy the way,\u201D she continued quickly, to conceal her emotion, \u201CI\r\nwouldn\u2019t trust myself with a pike; he\u2019d cut off my fingers like a\r\nknife.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe thereupon showed him some big pike arranged in order of size upon\r\nclean scoured shelves, beside some bronze-hued tench and little heaps\r\nof gudgeon. Her hands were now quite slimy with handling the carp, and\r\nas she stood there in the dampness rising from the tanks, she held them\r\noutstretched over the dripping fish on the stall. She seemed enveloped\r\nby an odour of spawn, that heavy scent which rises from among the reeds\r\nand water-lilies when the fish, languid in the sunlight, discharge\r\ntheir eggs. Then she wiped her hands on her apron, still smiling the\r\nplacid smile of a girl who knew nothing of passion in that quivering\r\natmosphere of the frigid loves of the river.\r\n\r\nThe kindliness which Claire showed to Florent was but a slight\r\nconsolation to him. By stopping to talk to the girl he only drew upon\r\nhimself still coarser jeers from the other stallkeepers. Claire\r\nshrugged her shoulders, and said that her mother was an old jade, and\r\nher sister a worthless creature. The injustice of the market folk\r\ntowards the new inspector filled her with indignation. The war between\r\nthem, however, grew more bitter every day. Florent had serious thoughts\r\nof resigning his post; indeed, he would not have retained it for\r\nanother twenty-four hours if he had not been afraid that Lisa might\r\nimagine him to be a coward. He was frightened of what she might say and\r\nwhat she might think. She was naturally well aware of the contest which\r\nwas going on between the fish-wives and their inspector; for the whole\r\nechoing market resounded with it, and the entire neighbourhood\r\ndiscussed each fresh incident with endless comments.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, well,\u201D Lisa would often say in the evening, after dinner, \u201CI\u2019d\r\nsoon bring them to reason if I had anything to do with them! Why, they\r\nare a lot of dirty jades that I wouldn\u2019t touch with the tip of my\r\nfinger! That Normande is the lowest of the low! I\u2019d soon crush her,\r\nthat I would! You should really use your authority, Florent. You are\r\nwrong to behave as you do. Put your foot down, and they\u2019ll all come to\r\ntheir senses very quickly, you\u2019ll see.\u201D\r\n\r\nA terrible climax was presently reached. One morning the servant of\r\nMadame Taboureau, the baker, came to the market to buy a brill; and the\r\nbeautiful Norman, having noticed her lingering near her stall for\r\nseveral minutes, began to make overtures to her in a coaxing way: \u201CCome\r\nand see me; I\u2019ll suit you,\u201D she said. \u201CWould you like a pair of soles,\r\nor a fine turbot?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen as the servant at last came up, and sniffed at a brill with that\r\ndissatisfied pout which buyers assume in the hope of getting what they\r\nwant at a lower price, La Normande continued:\r\n\r\n\u201CJust feel the weight of that, now,\u201D and so saying she laid the brill,\r\nwrapped in a sheet of thick yellow paper, on the woman\u2019s open palm.\r\n\r\nThe servant, a mournful little woman from Auvergne, felt the weight of\r\nthe brill, and examined its gills, still pouting, and saying not a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd how much do you want for it?\u201D she asked presently, in a reluctant\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\u201CFifteen francs,\u201D replied La Normande.\r\n\r\nAt this the servant hastily laid the brill on the stall again, and\r\nseemed anxious to hurry away, but the other detained her. \u201CWait a\r\nmoment,\u201D said she. \u201CWhat do you offer?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, I can\u2019t take it. It is much too dear.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, now, make me an offer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, will you take eight francs?\u201D\r\n\r\nOld Madame Mehudin, who was there, suddenly seemed to wake up, and\r\nbroke out into a contemptuous laugh. Did people think that she and her\r\ndaughter stole the fish they sold? \u201CEight francs for a brill that\r\nsize!\u201D she exclaimed. \u201CYou\u2019ll be wanting one for nothing next, to use\r\nas a cooling plaster!\u201D\r\n\r\nMeantime La Normande turned her head away, as though greatly offended.\r\nHowever, the servant came back twice and offered nine francs; and\r\nfinally she increased her bid to ten.\r\n\r\n\u201CAll right, come on, give me your money!\u201D cried the fish-girl, seeing\r\nthat the woman was now really going away.\r\n\r\nThe servant took her stand in front of the stall and entered into a\r\nfriendly gossip with old Madame Mehudin. Madame Taboureau, she said,\r\nwas so exacting! She had got some people coming to dinner that evening,\r\nsome cousins from Blois a notary and his wife. Madame Taboureau\u2019s\r\nfamily, she added, was a very respectable one, and she herself,\r\nalthough only a baker, had received an excellent education.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll clean it nicely for me, won\u2019t you?\u201D added the woman, pausing in\r\nher chatter.\r\n\r\nWith a jerk of her finger La Normande had removed the fish\u2019s entrails\r\nand tossed them into a pail. Then she slipped a corner of her apron\r\nunder its gills to wipe away a few grains of sand. \u201CThere, my dear,\u201D\r\nshe said, putting the fish into the servant\u2019s basket, \u201Cyou\u2019ll come back\r\nto thank me.\u201D\r\n\r\nCertainly the servant did come back a quarter of an hour afterwards,\r\nbut it was with a flushed, red face. She had been crying, and her\r\nlittle body was trembling all over with anger. Tossing the brill on to\r\nthe marble slab, she pointed to a broad gash in its belly that reached\r\nthe bone. Then a flood of broken words burst from her throat, which was\r\nstill contracted by sobbing: \u201CMadame Taboureau won\u2019t have it. She says\r\nshe couldn\u2019t put it on her table. She told me, too, that I was an\r\nidiot, and let myself be cheated by anyone. You can see for yourself\r\nthat the fish is spoilt. I never thought of turning it round; I quite\r\ntrusted you. Give me my ten francs back.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou should look at what you buy,\u201D the handsome Norman calmly observed.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as the servant was just raising her voice again, old Madame\r\nMehudin got up. \u201CJust you shut up!\u201D she cried. \u201CWe\u2019re not going to take\r\nback a fish that\u2019s been knocking about in other people\u2019s houses. How do\r\nwe know that you didn\u2019t let it fall and damage it yourself?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI! I damage it!\u201D The little servant was choking with indignation. \u201CAh!\r\nyou\u2019re a couple of thieves!\u201D she cried, sobbing bitterly. \u201CYes, a\r\ncouple of thieves! Madame Taboureau herself told me so!\u201D\r\n\r\nMatters then became uproarious. Boiling over with rage and brandishing\r\ntheir fists, both mother and daughter fairly exploded; while the poor\r\nlittle servant, quite bewildered by their voices, the one hoarse and\r\nthe other shrill, which belaboured her with insults as though they were\r\nbattledores and she a shuttlecock, sobbed on more bitterly than ever.\r\n\r\n\u201CBe off with you! Your Madame Taboureau would like to be half as fresh\r\nas that fish is! She\u2019d like us to sew it up for her, no doubt!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA whole fish for ten francs! What\u2019ll she want next!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen came coarse words and foul accusations. Had the servant been the\r\nmost worthless of her sex she could not have been more bitterly\r\nupbraided.\r\n\r\nFlorent, whom the market keeper had gone to fetch, made his appearance\r\nwhen the quarrel was at its hottest. The whole pavilion seemed to be in\r\na state of insurrection. The fish-wives, who manifest the keenest\r\njealousy of each other when the sale of a penny herring is in question,\r\ndisplay a united front when a quarrel arises with a buyer. They sang\r\nthe popular old ditty, \u201CThe baker\u2019s wife has heaps of crowns, which\r\ncost her precious little\u201D; they stamped their feet, and goaded the\r\nMehudins as though the latter were dogs which they were urging on to\r\nbite and devour. And there were even some, having stalls at the other\r\nend of the alley, who rushed up wildly, as though they meant to spring\r\nat the chignon of the poor little woman, she meantime being quite\r\nsubmerged by the flood of insulting abuse poured upon her.\r\n\r\n\u201CReturn mademoiselle her ten francs,\u201D said Florent sternly, when he had\r\nlearned what had taken place.\r\n\r\nBut old Madame Mehudin had her blood up. \u201CAs for you, my little man,\u201D\r\nquoth she, \u201Cgo to blazes! Here, that\u2019s how I\u2019ll return the ten francs!\u201D\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, she flung the brill with all her force at the head of\r\nMadame Taboureau\u2019s servant, who received it full in the face. The blood\r\nspurted from her nose, and the brill, after adhering for a moment to\r\nher cheeks, fell to the ground and burst with a flop like that of a wet\r\nclout. This brutal act threw Florent into a fury. The beautiful Norman\r\nfelt frightened and recoiled, as he cried out: \u201CI suspend you for a\r\nweek, and I will have your licence withdrawn. You hear me?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as the other fish-wives were still jeering behind him, he turned\r\nround with such a threatening air that they quailed like wild beasts\r\nmastered by the tamer, and tried to assume an expression of innocence.\r\nWhen the Mehudins had returned the ten francs, Florent peremptorily\r\nordered them to cease selling at once. The old woman was choking with\r\nrage, while the daughter kept silent, but turned very white. She, the\r\nbeautiful Norman, to be driven out of her stall!\r\n\r\nClaire said in her quiet voice that it served her mother and sister\r\nright, a remark which nearly resulted in the two girls tearing each\r\nother\u2019s hair out that evening when they returned home to the Rue\r\nPirouette. However, when the Mehudins came back to the market at the\r\nweek\u2019s end, they remained very quiet, reserved, and curt of speech,\r\nthough full of a cold-blooded wrath. Moreover, they found the pavilion\r\nquite calm and restored to order again. From that day forward the\r\nbeautiful Norman must have harboured the thought of some terrible\r\nvengeance. She felt that she really had Lisa to thank for what had\r\nhappened. She had met her, the day after the battle, carrying her head\r\nso high, that she had sworn she would make her pay dearly for her\r\nglance of triumph. She held interminable confabulations with Madame\r\nSaget, Madame Lec\u0153ur, and La Sarriette, in quiet corners of the market;\r\nhowever, all their chatter about the shameless conduct which they\r\nslanderously ascribed to Lisa and her cousin, and about the hairs which\r\nthey declared were found in Quenu\u2019s chitterlings, brought La Normande\r\nlittle consolation. She was trying to think of some very malicious plan\r\nof vengeance, which would strike her rival to the heart.\r\n\r\nHer child was growing up in the fish market in all freedom and neglect.\r\nWhen but three years old the youngster had been brought there, and day\r\nby day remained squatting on some rag amidst the fish. He would fall\r\nasleep beside the big tunnies as though he were one of them, and awake\r\namong the mackerel and whiting. The little rascal smelt of fish as\r\nstrongly as though he were some big fish\u2019s offspring. For a long time\r\nhis favourite pastime, whenever his mother\u2019s back was turned, was to\r\nbuild walls and houses of herrings; and he would also play at soldiers\r\non the marble slab, arranging the red gurnets in confronting lines,\r\npushing them against each other, and battering their heads, while\r\nimitating the sound of drum and trumpet with his lips; after which he\r\nwould throw them all into a heap again, and exclaim that they were\r\ndead. When he grew older he would prowl about his aunt Claire\u2019s stall\r\nto get hold of the bladders of the carp and pike which she gutted. He\r\nplaced them on the ground and made them burst, an amusement which\r\nafforded him vast delight. When he was seven he rushed about the\r\nalleys, crawled under the stalls, ferreted amongst the zinc bound fish\r\nboxes, and became the spoiled pet of all the women. Whenever they\r\nshowed him something fresh which pleased him, he would clasp his hands\r\nand exclaim in ecstasy, \u201COh, isn\u2019t it stunning!\u201D _Muche_ was the exact\r\nword which he used; _muche_ being the equivalent of \u201Cstunning\u201D in the\r\nlingo of the markets; and he used the expression so often that it clung\r\nto him as a nickname. He became known all over the place as \u201CMuche.\u201D It\r\nwas Muche here, there and everywhere; no one called him anything else.\r\nHe was to be met with in every nook; in out-of-the-way corners of the\r\noffices in the auction pavilion; among the piles of oyster baskets, and\r\nbetwixt the buckets where the refuse was thrown. With a pinky fairness\r\nof skin, he was like a young barbel frisking and gliding about in deep\r\nwater. He was as fond of running, streaming water as any young fry. He\r\nwas ever dabbling in the pools in the alleys. He wetted himself with\r\nthe drippings from the tables, and when no one was looking often slyly\r\nturned on the taps, rejoicing in the bursting gush of water. But it was\r\nespecially beside the fountains near the cellar steps that his mother\r\nwent to seek him in the evening, and she would bring him thence with\r\nhis hands quite blue, and his shoes, and even his pockets, full of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAt seven years old Muche was as pretty as an angel, and as coarse in\r\nhis manners as any carter. He had curly chestnut hair, beautiful eyes,\r\nand an innocent-looking mouth which gave vent to language that even a\r\ngendarme would have hesitated to use. Brought up amidst all the\r\nribaldry and profanity of the markets, he had the whole vocabulary of\r\nthe place on the tip of his tongue. With his hands on his hips he often\r\nmimicked Grandmother Mehudin in her anger, and at these times the\r\ncoarsest and vilest expressions would stream from his lips in a voice\r\nof crystalline purity that might have belonged to some little chorister\r\nchanting the _Ave Maria_. He would even try to assume a hoarse\r\nroughness of tone, seek to degrade and taint that exquisite freshness\r\nof childhood which made him resemble a _bambino_ on the Madonna\u2019s\r\nknees. The fish-wives laughed at him till they cried; and he,\r\nencouraged, could scarcely say a couple of words without rapping out an\r\noath. But in spite of all this he still remained charming,\r\nunderstanding nothing of the dirt amidst which he lived, kept in\r\nvigorous health by the fresh breezes and sharp odours of the fish\r\nmarket, and reciting his vocabulary of coarse indecencies with as pure\r\na face as though he were saying his prayers.\r\n\r\nThe winter was approaching, and Muche seemed very sensitive to the\r\ncold. As soon as the chilly weather set in he manifested a strong\r\npredilection for the inspector\u2019s office. This was situated in the\r\nleft-hand corner of the pavilion, on the side of the Rue Rambuteau. The\r\nfurniture consisted of a table, a stack of drawers, an easy-chair, two\r\nother chairs, and a stove. It was this stove which attracted Muche.\r\nFlorent quite worshipped children, and when he saw the little fellow,\r\nwith his dripping legs, gazing wistfully through the window, he made\r\nhim come inside. His first conversation with the lad caused him\r\nprofound amazement. Muche sat down in front of the stove, and in his\r\nquiet voice exclaimed: \u201CI\u2019ll just toast my toes, do you see? It\u2019s d\u2014\u2014d\r\ncold this morning.\u201D Then he broke into a rippling laugh, and added:\r\n\u201CAunt Claire looks awfully blue this morning. Is it true, sir, that you\r\nare sweet on her?\u201D\r\n\r\nAmazed though he was, Florent felt quite interested in the odd little\r\nfellow. The handsome Norman retained her surly bearing, but allowed her\r\nson to frequent the inspector\u2019s office without a word of objection.\r\nFlorent consequently concluded that he had the mother\u2019s permission to\r\nreceive the boy, and every afternoon he asked him in; by degrees\r\nforming the idea of turning him into a steady, respectable young\r\nfellow. He could almost fancy that his brother Quenu had grown little\r\nagain, and that they were both in the big room in the Rue Royer-Collard\r\nonce more. The life which his self-sacrificing nature pictured to him\r\nas perfect happiness was a life spent with some young being who would\r\nnever grow up, whom he could go on teaching for ever, and in whose\r\ninnocence he might still love his fellow man. On the third day of his\r\nacquaintance with Muche he brought an alphabet to the office, and the\r\nlad delighted him by the intelligence he manifested. He learned his\r\nletters with all the sharp precocity which marks the Parisian street\r\narab, and derived great amusement from the woodcuts illustrating the\r\nalphabet.\r\n\r\nHe found opportunities, too, for plenty of fine fun in the little\r\noffice, where the stove still remained the chief attraction and a\r\nsource of endless enjoyment. At first he cooked potatoes and chestnuts\r\nat it, but presently these seemed insipid, and he thereupon stole some\r\ngudgeons from his aunt Claire, roasted them one by one, suspended from\r\na string in front of the glowing fire, and then devoured them with\r\ngusto, though he had no bread. One day he even brought a carp with him;\r\nbut it was impossible to roast it sufficiently, and it made such a\r\nsmell in the office that both window and door had to be thrown open.\r\nSometimes, when the odour of all these culinary operations became too\r\nstrong, Florent would throw the fish into the street, but as a rule he\r\nonly laughed. By the end of a couple of months Muche was able to read\r\nfairly well, and his copy-books did him credit.\r\n\r\nMeantime, every evening the lad wearied his mother with his talk about\r\nhis good friend Florent. His good friend Florent had drawn him pictures\r\nof trees and of men in huts, said he. His good friend Florent waved his\r\narm and said that men would be far better if they all knew how to read.\r\nAnd at last La Normande heard so much about Florent that she seemed to\r\nbe almost intimate with this man against whom she harboured so much\r\nrancour. One day she shut Muche up at home to prevent him from going to\r\nthe inspector\u2019s, but he cried so bitterly that she gave him his liberty\r\nagain on the following morning. There was very little determination\r\nabout her, in spite of her broad shoulders and bold looks. When the lad\r\ntold her how nice and warm he had been in the office, and came back to\r\nher with his clothes quite dry, she felt a sort of vague gratitude, a\r\npleasure in knowing that he had found a shelter-place where he could\r\nsit with his feet in front of a fire. Later on, she was quite touched\r\nwhen he read her some words from a scrap of soiled newspaper wrapped\r\nround a slice of conger-eel. By degrees, indeed, she began to think,\r\nthough without admitting it, that Florent could not really be a bad\r\nsort of fellow. She felt respect for his knowledge, mingled with an\r\nincreasing curiosity to see more of him and learn something of his\r\nlife. Then, all at once, she found an excuse for gratifying this\r\ninquisitiveness. She would use it as a means of vengeance. It would be\r\nfine fun to make friends with Florent and embroil him with that great\r\nfat Lisa.\r\n\r\n\u201CDoes your good friend Florent ever speak to you about me?\u201D she asked\r\nMuche one morning as she was dressing him.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, no,\u201D replied the boy. \u201CWe enjoy ourselves.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, you can tell him that I\u2019ve quite forgiven him, and that I\u2019m much\r\nobliged to him for having taught you to read.\u201D\r\n\r\nThenceforward the child was entrusted with some message every day. He\r\nwent backwards and forwards from his mother to the inspector, and from\r\nthe inspector to his mother, charged with kindly words and questions\r\nand answers, which he repeated mechanically without knowing their\r\nmeaning. He might, indeed, have been safely trusted with the most\r\ncompromising communications. However, the beautiful Norman felt afraid\r\nof appearing timid, and so one day she herself went to the inspector\u2019s\r\noffice and sat down on the second chair, while Muche was having his\r\nwriting lesson. She proved very suave and complimentary, and Florent\r\nwas by far the more embarrassed of the two. They only spoke of the lad;\r\nand when Florent expressed a fear that he might not be able to continue\r\nthe lessons in the office, La Normande invited him to come to their\r\nhome in the evening. She spoke also of payment; but at this he blushed,\r\nand said that he certainly would not come if any mention were made of\r\nmoney. Thereupon the young woman determined in her own mind that she\r\nwould recompense him with presents of choice fish.\r\n\r\nPeace was thus made between them; the beautiful Norman even took\r\nFlorent under her protection. Apart from this, however, the whole\r\nmarket was becoming reconciled to the new inspector, the fish-wives\r\narriving at the conclusion that he was really a better fellow than\r\nMonsieur Verlaque, notwithstanding his strange eyes. It was only old\r\nMadame Mehudin who still shrugged her shoulders, full of rancour as she\r\nwas against the \u201Clong lanky-guts,\u201D as she contemptuously called him.\r\nAnd then, too, a strange thing happened. One morning, when Florent\r\nstopped with a smile before Claire\u2019s tanks, the girl dropped an eel\r\nwhich she was holding and angrily turned her back upon him, her cheeks\r\nquite swollen and reddened by temper. The inspector was so much\r\nastonished that he spoke to La Normande about it.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, never mind her,\u201D said the young woman; \u201Cshe\u2019s cracked. She makes a\r\npoint of always differing from everybody else. She only behaved like\r\nthat to annoy me.\u201D\r\n\r\nLa Normande was now triumphant\u2014she strutted about her stall, and became\r\nmore coquettish than ever, arranging her hair in the most elaborate\r\nmanner. Meeting the handsome Lisa one day she returned her look of\r\nscorn, and even burst out laughing in her face. The certainty she felt\r\nof driving the mistress of the pork shop to despair by winning her\r\ncousin from her endowed her with a gay, sonorous laugh, which rolled up\r\nfrom her chest and rippled her white plump neck. She now had the whim\r\nof dressing Muche very showily in a little Highland costume and velvet\r\nbonnet. The lad had never previously worn anything but a tattered\r\nblouse. It unfortunately happened, however, that just about this time\r\nhe again became very fond of the water. The ice had melted and the\r\nweather was mild, so he gave his Scotch jacket a bath, turning the\r\nfountain tap on at full flow and letting the water pour down his arm\r\nfrom his elbow to his hand. He called this \u201Cplaying at gutters.\u201D Then a\r\nlittle later, when his mother came up and caught him, she found him\r\nwith two other young scamps watching a couple of little fishes swimming\r\nabout in his velvet cap, which he had filled with water.\r\n\r\nFor nearly eight months Florent lived in the markets, feeling continual\r\ndrowsiness. After his seven years of suffering he had lighted upon such\r\ncalm quietude, such unbroken regularity of life, that he was scarcely\r\nconscious of existing. He gave himself up to this jog-trot peacefulness\r\nwith a dazed sort of feeling, continually experiencing surprise at\r\nfinding himself each morning in the same armchair in the little office.\r\nThis office with its bare hut-like appearance had a charm for him. He\r\nhere found a quiet and secluded refuge amidst that ceaseless roar of\r\nthe markets which made him dream of some surging sea spreading around\r\nhim, and isolating him from the world. Gradually, however, a vague\r\nnervousness began to prey upon him; he became discontented, accused\r\nhimself of faults which he could not define, and began to rebel against\r\nthe emptiness which he experienced more and more acutely in mind and\r\nbody. Then, too, the evil smells of the fish market brought him nausea.\r\nBy degrees he became unhinged, his vague boredom developing into\r\nrestless, nervous excitement.\r\n\r\nAll his days were precisely alike, spent among the same sounds and the\r\nsame odours. In the mornings the noisy buzzing of the auction sales\r\nresounded in his ears like a distant echo of bells; and sometimes, when\r\nthere was a delay in the arrival of the fish, the auctions continued\r\ntill very late. Upon these occasions he remained in the pavilion till\r\nnoon, disturbed at every moment by quarrels and disputes, which he\r\nendeavoured to settle with scrupulous justice. Hours elapsed before he\r\ncould get free of some miserable matter or other which was exciting the\r\nmarket. He paced up and down amidst the crush and uproar of the sales,\r\nslowly perambulating the alleys and occasionally stopping in front of\r\nthe stalls which fringed the Rue Rambuteau, and where lay rosy heaps of\r\nprawns and baskets of boiled lobsters with tails tied backwards, while\r\nlive ones were gradually dying as they sprawled over the marble slabs.\r\nAnd then he would watch gentlemen in silk hats and black gloves\r\nbargaining with the fish-wives, and finally going off with boiled\r\nlobsters wrapped in paper in the pockets of their frock-coats.[*]\r\nFarther away, at the temporary stalls, where the commoner sorts of fish\r\nwere sold, he would recognise the bareheaded women of the\r\nneighbourhood, who always came at the same hour to make their\r\npurchases.\r\n\r\n[*] The little fish-basket for the use of customers, so familiar in\r\nLondon, is not known in Paris.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt times he took an interest in some well-dressed lady trailing her\r\nlace petticoats over the damp stones, and escorted by a servant in a\r\nwhite apron; and he would follow her at a little distance on noticing\r\nhow the fish-wives shrugged their shoulders at sight of her air of\r\ndisgust. The medley of hampers and baskets and bags, the crowd of\r\nskirts flitting along the damp alleys, occupied his attention until\r\nlunchtime. He took a delight in the dripping water and the fresh breeze\r\nas he passed from the acrid smell of the shell-fish to the pungent\r\nodour of the salted fish. It was always with the latter that he brought\r\nhis official round of inspection to a close. The cases of red herrings,\r\nthe Nantes sardines on their layers of leaves, and the rolled cod,\r\nexposed for sale under the eyes of stout, faded fish-wives, brought him\r\nthoughts of a voyage necessitating a vast supply of salted provisions.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the markets became quieter, grew drowsy; and Florent\r\nthen shut himself up in his office, made out his reports, and enjoyed\r\nthe happiest hours of his day. If he happened to go out and cross the\r\nfish market, he found it almost deserted. There was no longer the\r\ncrushing and pushing and uproar of ten o\u2019clock in the morning. The\r\nfish-wives, seated behind their stalls, leant back knitting, while a\r\nfew belated purchasers prowled about casting sidelong glances at the\r\nremaining fish, with the thoughtful eyes and compressed lips of women\r\nclosely calculating the price of their dinner. At last the twilight\r\nfell, there was a noise of boxes being moved, and the fish was laid for\r\nthe night on beds of ice; and then, after witnessing the closing of the\r\ngates, Florent went off, seemingly carrying the fish market along with\r\nhim in his clothes and his beard and his hair.\r\n\r\nFor the first few months this penetrating odour caused him no great\r\ndiscomfort. The winter was a severe one, the frosts converted the\r\nalleys into slippery mirrors, and the fountains and marble slabs were\r\nfringed with a lacework of ice. In the mornings it was necessary to\r\nplace little braziers underneath the taps before a drop of water could\r\nbe drawn. The frozen fish had twisted tails; and, dull of hue and hard\r\nto the touch like unpolished metal, gave out a ringing sound akin to\r\nthat of pale cast-iron when it snaps. Until February the pavilion\r\npresented a most mournful appearance: it was deserted, and wrapped in a\r\nbristling shroud of ice. But with March came a thaw, with mild weather\r\nand fogs and rain. Then the fish became soft again, and unpleasant\r\nodours mingled with the smell of mud wafted from the neighbouring\r\nstreets. These odours were as yet vague, tempered by the moisture which\r\nclung to the ground. But in the blazing June afternoons a reeking\r\nstench arose, and the atmosphere became heavy with a pestilential haze.\r\nThe upper windows were then opened, and huge blinds of grey canvas were\r\ndrawn beneath the burning sky. Nevertheless, a fiery rain seemed to be\r\npouring down, heating the market as though it were a big stove, and\r\nthere was not a breath of air to waft away the noxious emanations from\r\nthe fish. A visible steam went up from the stalls.\r\n\r\nThe masses of food amongst which Florent lived now began to cause him\r\nthe greatest discomfort. The disgust with which the pork shop had\r\nfilled him came back in a still more intolerable fashion. He almost\r\nsickened as he passed these masses of fish, which, despite all the\r\nwater lavished upon them, turned bad under a sudden whiff of hot air.\r\nEven when he shut himself up in his office his discomfort continued,\r\nfor the abominable odour forced its way through the chinks in the\r\nwoodwork of the window and door. When the sky was grey and leaden, the\r\nlittle room remained quite dark; and then the day was like a long\r\ntwilight in the depths of some fetid march. He was often attacked by\r\nfits of nervous excitement, and felt a craving desire to walk; and he\r\nwould then descend into the cellars by the broad staircase opening in\r\nthe middle of the pavilion. In the pent-up air down below, in the dim\r\nlight of the occasional gas jets, he once more found the refreshing\r\ncoolness diffused by pure cold water. He would stand in front of the\r\nbig tank where the reserve stock of live fish was kept, and listen to\r\nthe ceaseless murmur of the four streamlets of water falling from the\r\nfour corners of the central urn, and then spreading into a broad stream\r\nand gliding beneath the locked gratings of the basins with a gentle and\r\ncontinuous flow. This subterranean spring, this stream murmuring in the\r\ngloom, had a tranquillising effect upon him. Of an evening, too, he\r\ndelighted in the fine sunsets which threw the delicate lacework of the\r\nmarket buildings blackly against the red glow of the heavens. The\r\ndancing dust of the last sun rays streamed through every opening,\r\nthrough every chink of the Venetian shutters, and the whole was like\r\nsome luminous transparency on which the slender shafts of the columns,\r\nthe elegant curves of the girders, and the geometrical tracery of the\r\nroofs were minutely outlined. Florent feasted his eyes on this mighty\r\ndiagram washed in with Indian ink on phosphorescent vellum, and his\r\nmind reverted to his old fancy of a colossal machine with wheels and\r\nlevers and beams espied in the crimson glow of the fires blazing\r\nbeneath its boilers. At each consecutive hour of the day the changing\r\nplay of the light\u2014from the bluish haze of early morning and the black\r\nshadows of noon to the flaring of the sinking sun and the paling of its\r\nfires in the ashy grey of the twilight\u2014revealed the markets under a new\r\naspect; but on the flaming evenings, when the foul smells arose and\r\nforced their way across the broad yellow beams like hot puffs of steam,\r\nFlorent again experienced discomfort, and his dream changed, and he\r\nimagined himself in some gigantic knacker\u2019s boiling-house where the fat\r\nof a whole people was being melted down.\r\n\r\nThe coarseness of the market people, whose words and gestures seemed to\r\nbe infected with the evil smell of the place, also made him suffer. He\r\nwas very tolerant, and showed no mock modesty; still, these impudent\r\nwomen often embarrassed him. Madame Francois, whom he had again met,\r\nwas the only one with whom he felt at ease. She showed such pleasure on\r\nlearning he had found a berth and was quite comfortable and out of\r\nworry, as she put it, that he was quite touched. The laughter of Lisa,\r\nthe handsome Norman, and the others disquieted him; but of Madame\r\nFrancois he would willingly have made a confidante. She never laughed\r\nmockingly at him; when she did laugh, it was like a woman rejoicing at\r\nanother\u2019s happiness. She was a brave, plucky creature, too; hers was a\r\nhard business in winter, during the frosts, and the rainy weather was\r\nstill more trying. On some mornings Florent saw her arrive in a pouring\r\ndeluge which had been slowly, coldly falling ever since the previous\r\nnight. Between Nanterre and Paris the wheels of her cart had sunk up to\r\nthe axles in mud, and Balthazar was caked with mire to his belly. His\r\nmistress would pity him and sympathise with him as she wiped him down\r\nwith some old aprons.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe poor creatures are very sensitive,\u201D said she; \u201Ca mere nothing\r\ngives them a cold. Ah, my poor old Balthazar! I really thought that we\r\nhad tumbled into the Seine as we crossed the Neuilly bridge, the rain\r\ncame down in such a deluge!\u201D\r\n\r\nWhile Balthazar was housed in the inn stable his mistress remained in\r\nthe pouring rain to sell her vegetables. The footway was transformed\r\ninto a lake of liquid mud. The cabbages, carrots, and turnips were\r\npelted by the grey water, quite drowned by the muddy torrent that\r\nrushed along the pavement. There was no longer any of that glorious\r\ngreenery so apparent on bright mornings. The market gardeners, cowering\r\nin their heavy cloaks beneath the downpour, swore at the municipality\r\nwhich, after due inquiry, had declared that rain was in no way\r\ninjurious to vegetables, and that there was accordingly no necessity to\r\nerect any shelters.\r\n\r\nThose rainy mornings greatly worried Florent, who thought about Madame\r\nFrancois. He always managed to slip away and get a word with her. But\r\nhe never found her at all low-spirited. She shook herself like a\r\npoodle, saying that she was quite used to such weather, and was not\r\nmade of sugar, to melt away beneath a few drops of rain. However, he\r\nmade her seek refuge for a few minutes in one of the covered ways, and\r\nfrequently even took her to Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, where they had some hot\r\nwine together. While she with her peaceful face beamed on him in all\r\nfriendliness, he felt quite delighted with the healthy odour of the\r\nfields which she brought into the midst of the foul market atmosphere.\r\nShe exhaled a scent of earth, hay, fresh air, and open skies.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must come to Nanterre, my lad,\u201D she said to him, \u201Cand look at my\r\nkitchen garden. I have put borders of thyme everywhere. How bad your\r\nvillainous Paris does smell!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she went off, dripping. Florent, on his side, felt quite\r\nre-invigorated when he parted from her. He tried, too the effect of\r\nwork upon the nervous depression from which he suffered. He was a man\r\nof a very methodical temperament, and sometimes carried out his plans\r\nfor the allotment of his time with a strictness that bordered on mania.\r\nHe shut himself up two evenings a week in order to write an exhaustive\r\nwork on Cayenne. His modest bedroom was excellently adapted, he\r\nthought, to calm his mind and incline him to work. He lighted his fire,\r\nsaw that the pomegranate at the foot of the bed was looking all right,\r\nand then seated himself at the little table, and remained working till\r\nmidnight. He had pushed the missal and Dream-book back in the drawer,\r\nwhich was now filling with notes, memoranda, manuscripts of all kinds.\r\nThe work on Cayenne made but slow progress, however, as it was\r\nconstantly being interrupted by other projects, plans for enormous\r\nundertakings which he sketched out in a few words. He successively\r\ndrafted an outline of a complete reform of the administrative system of\r\nthe markets, a scheme for transforming the city dues, levied on produce\r\nas it entered Paris, into taxes levied upon the sales, a new system of\r\nvictualling the poorer neighbourhoods, and, lastly, a somewhat vague\r\nsocialist enactment for the storing in common warehouses of all the\r\nprovisions brought to the markets, and the ensuring of a minimum daily\r\nsupply to each household in Paris. As he sat there, with his head bent\r\nover his table, and his mind absorbed in thoughts of all these weighty\r\nmatters, his gloomy figure cast a great black shadow on the soft\r\npeacefulness of the garret. Sometimes a chaffinch which he had picked\r\nup one snowy day in the market would mistake the lamplight for the day,\r\nand break the silence, which only the scratching of Florent\u2019s pen on\r\nhis paper disturbed, by a cry.\r\n\r\nFlorent was fated to revert to politics. He had suffered too much\r\nthrough them not to make them the dearest occupation of his life. Under\r\nother conditions he might have become a good provincial schoolmaster,\r\nhappy in the peaceful life of some little town. But he had been treated\r\nas though he were a wolf, and felt as though he had been marked out by\r\nexile for some great combative task. His nervous discomfort was the\r\noutcome of his long reveries at Cayenne, the brooding bitterness he had\r\nfelt at his unmerited sufferings, and the vows he had secretly sworn to\r\navenge humanity and justice\u2014the former scourged with a whip, and the\r\nlatter trodden under foot. Those colossal markets and their teeming\r\nodoriferous masses of food had hastened the crisis. To Florent they\r\nappeared symbolical of some glutted, digesting beast, of Paris,\r\nwallowing in its fat and silently upholding the Empire. He seemed to be\r\nencircled by swelling forms and sleek, fat faces, which ever and ever\r\nprotested against his own martyrlike scragginess and sallow,\r\ndiscontented visage. To him the markets were like the stomach of the\r\nshopkeeping classes, the stomach of all the folks of average rectitude\r\npuffing itself out, rejoicing, glistening in the sunshine, and\r\ndeclaring that everything was for the best, since peaceable people had\r\nnever before grown so beautifully fat. As these thoughts passed through\r\nhis mind Florent clenched his fists, and felt ready for a struggle,\r\nmore irritated now by the thought of his exile than he had been when he\r\nfirst returned to France. Hatred resumed entire possession of him. He\r\noften let his pen drop and became absorbed in dreams. The dying fire\r\ncast a bright glow upon his face; the lamp burned smokily, and the\r\nchaffinch fell asleep again on one leg, with its head tucked under its\r\nwing.\r\n\r\nSometimes Auguste, on coming upstairs at eleven o\u2019clock and seeing the\r\nlight shining under the door, would knock, before going to bed. Florent\r\nadmitted him with some impatience. The assistant sat down in front of\r\nthe fire, speaking but little, and never saying why he had come. His\r\neyes would all the time remain fixed upon the photograph of himself and\r\nAugustine in their Sunday finery. Florent came to the conclusion that\r\nthe young man took a pleasure in visiting the room for the simple\r\nreason that it had been occupied by his sweetheart; and one evening he\r\nasked him with a smile if he had guessed rightly.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, perhaps it is so,\u201D replied Auguste, very much surprised at the\r\ndiscovery which he himself now made of the reasons which actuated him.\r\n\u201CI\u2019d really never thought of that before. I came to see you without\r\nknowing why. But if I were to tell Augustine, how she\u2019d laugh!\u201D\r\n\r\nWhenever he showed himself at all loquacious, his one eternal theme was\r\nthe pork shop which he was going to set up with Augustine at Plaisance.\r\nHe seemed so perfectly assured of arranging his life in accordance with\r\nhis desires, that Florent grew to feel a sort of respect for him,\r\nmingled with irritation. After all, the young fellow was very resolute\r\nand energetic, in spite of his seeming stupidity. He made straight for\r\nthe goal he had in view, and would doubtless reach it in perfect\r\nassurance and happiness. On the evenings of these visits from the\r\napprentice, Florent could not settle down to work again; he went off to\r\nbed in a discontented mood, and did not recover his equilibrium till\r\nthe thought passed through his mind, \u201CWhy, that Auguste is a perfect\r\nanimal!\u201D\r\n\r\nEvery month he went to Clamart to see Monsieur Verlaque. These visits\r\nwere almost a delight to him. The poor man still lingered on, to the\r\ngreat astonishment of Gavard, who had not expected him to last for more\r\nthan six months. Every time that Florent went to see him Verlaque would\r\ndeclare that he was feeling better, and was most anxious to resume his\r\nwork again. But the days glided by, and he had serious relapses.\r\nFlorent would sit by his bedside, chat about the fish market, and do\r\nwhat he could to enliven him. He deposited on the pedestal table the\r\nfifty francs which he surrendered to him each month; and the old\r\ninspector, though the payment had been agreed upon, invariably\r\nprotested, and seemed disinclined to take the money. Then they would\r\nbegin to speak of something else, and the coins remained lying on the\r\ntable. When Florent went away, Madame Verlaque always accompanied him\r\nto the street door. She was a gentle little woman, of a very tearful\r\ndisposition. Her one topic of conversation was the expense necessitated\r\nby her husband\u2019s illness, the costliness of chicken broth, butcher\u2019s\r\nmeat, Bordeaux wine, medicine, and doctors\u2019 fees. Her doleful\r\nconversation greatly embarrassed Florent, and on the first few\r\noccasions he did not understand the drift of it. But at last, as the\r\npoor woman seemed always in a state of tears, and kept saying how happy\r\nand comfortable they had been when they had enjoyed the full salary of\r\neighteen hundred francs a year, he timidly offered to make her a\r\nprivate allowance, to be kept secret from her husband. This offer,\r\nhowever, she declined, inconsistently declaring that the fifty francs\r\nwere sufficient. But in the course of the month she frequently wrote to\r\nFlorent, calling him their saviour. Her handwriting was small and fine,\r\nyet she would contrive to fill three pages of letter paper with humble,\r\nflowing sentences entreating the loan of ten francs; and this she at\r\nlast did so regularly that wellnigh the whole of Florent\u2019s hundred and\r\nfifty francs found its way to the Verlaques. The husband was probably\r\nunaware of it; however, the wife gratefully kissed Florent\u2019s hands.\r\nThis charity afforded him the greatest pleasure, and he concealed it as\r\nthough it were some forbidden selfish indulgence.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat rascal Verlaque is making a fool of you,\u201D Gavard would sometimes\r\nsay. \u201CHe\u2019s coddling himself up finely now that you are doing the work\r\nand paying him an income.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt last one day Florent replied:\r\n\r\n\u201COh, we\u2019ve arranged matters together. I\u2019m only to give him twenty-five\r\nfrancs a month in future.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Florent had but little need of money. The Quenus\r\ncontinued to provide him with board and lodging; and the few francs\r\nwhich he kept by him sufficed to pay for the refreshment he took in the\r\nevening at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s. His life had gradually assumed all the\r\nregularity of clockwork. He worked in his bedroom, continued to teach\r\nlittle Muche twice a week from eight to nine o\u2019clock, devoted an\r\nevening to Lisa, to avoid offending her, and spent the rest of his\r\nspare time in the little \u201Ccabinet\u201D with Gavard and his friends.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to the Mehudins\u2019 there was a touch of tutorial stiffness\r\nin his gentle demeanour. He was pleased with the old house in the Rue\r\nPirouette. On the ground floor he passed through the faint odours\r\npervading the premises of the purveyor of cooked vegetables. Big pans\r\nof boiled spinach and sorrel stood cooling in the little backyard. Then\r\nhe ascended the winding staircase, greasy and dark, with worn and\r\nbulging steps which sloped in a disquieting manner. The Mehudins\r\noccupied the whole of the second floor. Even when they had attained to\r\ncomfortable circumstances the old mother had always declined to move\r\ninto fresh quarters, despite all the supplications of her daughters,\r\nwho dreamt of living in a new house in a fine broad street. But on this\r\npoint the old woman was not to be moved; she had lived there, she said,\r\nand meant to die there. She contented herself, moreover, with a dark\r\nlittle closet, leaving the largest rooms to Claire and La Normande. The\r\nlater, with the authority of the elder born, had taken possession of\r\nthe room that overlooked the street; it was the best and largest of the\r\nsuite. Claire was so much annoyed at her sister\u2019s action in the matter\r\nthat she refused to occupy the adjoining room, whose window overlooked\r\nthe yard, and obstinately insisted on sleeping on the other side of the\r\nlanding, in a sort of garret, which she did not even have whitewashed.\r\nHowever, she had her own key, and so was independent; directly anything\r\nhappened to displease her she locked herself up in her own quarters.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, when Florent arrived the Mehudins were just finishing their\r\ndinner. Muche sprang to his neck, and for a moment the young man\r\nremained seated with the lad chattering between his legs. Then, when\r\nthe oilcloth cover had been wiped, the lesson began on a corner of the\r\ntable. The beautiful Norman gave Florent a cordial welcome. She\r\ngenerally began to knit or mend some linen, and would draw her chair up\r\nto the table and work by the light of the same lamp as the others; and\r\nshe frequently put down her needle to listen to the lesson, which\r\nfilled her with surprise. She soon began to feel warm esteem for this\r\nman who seemed so clever, who, in speaking to the little one, showed\r\nhimself as gentle as a woman, and manifested angelic patience in again\r\nand again repeating the same instructions. She no longer considered him\r\nat all plain, but even felt somewhat jealous of beautiful Lisa. And\r\nthen she drew her chair still nearer, and gazed at Florent with an\r\nembarrassing smile.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you are jogging my elbow, mother, and I can\u2019t write,\u201D Muche\r\nexclaimed angrily. \u201CThere! see what a blot you\u2019ve made me make! Get\r\nfurther away, do!\u201D\r\n\r\nLa Normande now gradually began to say a good many unpleasant things\r\nabout beautiful Lisa. She pretended that the latter concealed her real\r\nage, that she laced her stays so tightly that she nearly suffocated\r\nherself, and that if she came down of a morning looking so trim and\r\nneat, without a single hair out of place, it must be because she looked\r\nperfectly hideous when in dishabille. Then La Normande would raise her\r\narm a little, and say that there was no need for her to wear any stays\r\nto cramp and deform her figure. At these times the lessons would be\r\ninterrupted, and Muche gazed with interest at his mother as she raised\r\nher arms. Florent listened to her, and even laughed, thinking to\r\nhimself that women were very odd creatures. The rivalry between the\r\nbeautiful Norman and beautiful Lisa amused him.\r\n\r\nMuche, however, managed to finish his page of writing. Florent, who was\r\na good penman, set him copies in large hand and round hand on slips of\r\npaper. The words he chose were very long and took up the whole line,\r\nand he evinced a marked partiality for such expressions as\r\n\u201Ctyrannically,\u201D \u201Cliberticide,\u201D \u201Cunconstitutional,\u201D and \u201Crevolutionary.\u201D\r\nAt times also he made the boy copy such sentences as these: \u201CThe day of\r\njustice will surely come\u201D; \u201CThe suffering of the just man is the\r\ncondemnation of the oppressor\u201D; \u201CWhen the hour strikes, the guilty\r\nshall fall.\u201D In preparing these copy slips he was, indeed, influenced\r\nby the ideas which haunted his brain; he would for the time become\r\nquite oblivious of Muche, the beautiful Norman, and all his\r\nsurroundings. The lad would have copied Rousseau\u2019s \u201CContrat Social\u201D had\r\nhe been told to do so; and thus, drawing each letter in turn, he filled\r\npage after page with lines of \u201Ctyrannically\u201D and \u201Cunconstitutional.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs long as the tutor remained there, old Madame Mehudin kept fidgeting\r\nround the table, muttering to herself. She still harboured terrible\r\nrancour against Florent; and asserted that it was folly to make the lad\r\nwork in that way at a time when children should be in bed. She would\r\ncertainly have turned that \u201Cspindle-shanks\u201D out of the house, if the\r\nbeautiful Norman, after a stormy scene, had not bluntly told her that\r\nshe would go to live elsewhere if she were not allowed to receive whom\r\nshe chose. However, the pair began quarrelling again on the subject\r\nevery evening.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou may say what you like,\u201D exclaimed the old woman; \u201Cbut he\u2019s got\r\ntreacherous eyes. And, besides, I\u2019m always suspicious of those skinny\r\npeople. A skinny man\u2019s capable of anything. I\u2019ve never come across a\r\ndecent one yet. That one\u2019s as flat as a board. And he\u2019s got such an\r\nugly face, too! Though I\u2019m sixty-five and more, I\u2019d precious soon send\r\nhim about his business if he came a-courting of me!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe said this because she had a shrewd idea of how matters were likely\r\nto turn out. And then she went on to speak in laudatory terms of\r\nMonsieur Lebigre, who, indeed, paid the greatest attention to the\r\nbeautiful Norman. Apart from the handsome dowry which he imagined she\r\nwould bring with her, he considered that she would be a magnificent\r\nacquisition to his counter. The old woman never missed an opportunity\r\nto sound his praises; there was no lankiness, at any rate, about him,\r\nsaid she; he was stout and strong, with a pair of calves which would\r\nhave done honour even to one of the Emperor\u2019s footmen.\r\n\r\nHowever, La Normande shrugged her shoulders and snappishly replied:\r\n\u201CWhat do I care whether he\u2019s stout or not? I don\u2019t want him or anybody.\r\nAnd besides, I shall do as I please.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, if the old woman became too pointed in her remarks, the other\r\nadded: \u201CIt\u2019s no business of yours, and besides, it isn\u2019t true. Hold\r\nyour tongue and don\u2019t worry me.\u201D And thereupon she would go off into\r\nher room, banging the door behind her. Florent, however, had a yet more\r\nbitter enemy than Madame Mehudin in the house. As soon as ever he\r\narrived there, Claire would get up without a word, take a candle, and\r\ngo off to her own room on the other side of the landing; and she could\r\nbe heard locking her door in a burst of sullen anger. One evening when\r\nher sister asked the tutor to dinner, she prepared her own food on the\r\nlanding, and ate it in her bedroom; and now and again she secluded\r\nherself so closely that nothing was seen of her for a week at a time.\r\nShe usually retained her appearance of soft lissomness, but\r\nperiodically had a fit of iron rigidity, when her eyes blazed from\r\nunder her pale tawny locks like those of a distrustful wild animal. Old\r\nMother Mehudin, fancying that she might relieve herself in her company,\r\nonly made her furious by speaking to her of Florent; and thereupon the\r\nold woman, in her exasperation, told everyone that she would have gone\r\noff and left her daughters to themselves had she not been afraid of\r\ntheir devouring each other if they remained alone together.\r\n\r\nAs Florent went away one evening, he passed in front of Claire\u2019s door,\r\nwhich was standing wide open. He saw the girl look at him, and turn\r\nvery red. Her hostile demeanour annoyed him; and it was only the\r\ntimidity which he felt in the presence of women that restrained him\r\nfrom seeking an explanation of her conduct. On this particular evening\r\nhe would certainly have addressed her if he had not detected\r\nMademoiselle Saget\u2019s pale face peering over the balustrade of the upper\r\nlanding. So he went his way, but had not taken a dozen steps before\r\nClaire\u2019s door was closed behind him with such violence as to shake the\r\nwhole staircase.
