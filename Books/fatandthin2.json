 It was after this that Mademoiselle Saget, eager to\r\npropagate slander, went about repeating everywhere that Madame Quenu\u2019s\r\ncousin was \u201Ccarrying on\u201D most dreadfully with both the Mehudin girls.\r\n\r\nFlorent, however, gave very little thought to these two handsome young\r\nwomen. His usual manner towards them was that of a man who has but\r\nlittle success with the sex. Certainly he had come to entertain a\r\nfeeling of genuine friendship for La Normande, who really displayed a\r\nvery good heart when her impetuous temper did not run away with her.\r\nBut he never went any further than this. Moreover, the queenly\r\nproportions of her robust figure filled him with a kind of alarm; and\r\nof an evening, whenever she drew her chair up to the lamp and bent\r\nforward as though to look at Muche\u2019s copy-book, he drew in his own\r\nsharp bony elbows and shrunken shoulders as if realising what a pitiful\r\nspecimen of humanity he was by the side of that buxom, hardy creature\r\nso full of the life of ripe womanhood. Moreover, there was another\r\nreason why he recoiled from her. The smells of the markets distressed\r\nhim; on finishing his duties of an evening he would have liked to\r\nescape from the fishy odour amidst which his days were spent; but,\r\nalas! beautiful though La Normande was, this odour seemed to adhere to\r\nher silky skin. She had tried every sort of aromatic oil, and bathed\r\nfreely; but as soon as the freshening influence of the bath was over\r\nher blood again impregnated her skin with the faint odour of salmon,\r\nthe musky perfume of smelts, and the pungent scent of herrings and\r\nskate. Her skirts, too, as she moved about, exhaled these fishy smells,\r\nand she walked as though amidst an atmosphere redolent of slimy\r\nseaweed. With her tall, goddess-like figure, her purity of form, and\r\ntransparency of complexion she resembled some lovely antique marble\r\nthat had rolled about in the depths of the sea and had been brought to\r\nland in some fisherman\u2019s net.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget, however, swore by all her gods that Florent was the\r\nyoung woman\u2019s lover. According to her account, indeed, he courted both\r\nthe sisters. She had quarrelled with the beautiful Norman about a\r\nten-sou dab; and ever since this falling-out she had manifested warm\r\nfriendship for handsome Lisa. By this means she hoped the sooner to\r\narrive at a solution of what she called the Quenus\u2019 mystery. Florent\r\nstill continued to elude her curiosity, and she told her friends that\r\nshe felt like a body without a soul, though she was careful not to\r\nreveal what was troubling her so grievously. A young girl infatuated\r\nwith a hopeless passion could not have been in more distress than this\r\nterrible old woman at finding herself unable to solve the mystery of\r\nthe Quenus\u2019 cousin. She was constantly playing the spy on Florent,\r\nfollowing him about, and watching him, in a burning rage at her failure\r\nto satisfy her rampant curiosity. Now that he had begun to visit the\r\nMehudins she was for ever haunting the stairs and landings. She soon\r\ndiscovered that handsome Lisa was much annoyed at Florent visiting\r\n\u201Cthose women,\u201D and accordingly she called at the pork shop every\r\nmorning with a budget of information. She went in shrivelled and shrunk\r\nby the frosty air, and, resting her hands on the heating-pan to warm\r\nthem, remained in front of the counter buying nothing, but repeating in\r\nher shrill voice: \u201CHe was with them again yesterday; he seems to live\r\nthere now. I heard La Normande call him \u2018my dear\u2019 on the staircase.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe indulged like this in all sorts of lies in order to remain in the\r\nshop and continue warming her hands for a little longer. On the morning\r\nafter the evening when she had heard Claire close her door behind\r\nFlorent, she spun out her story for a good half hour, inventing all\r\nsorts of mendacious and abominable particulars.\r\n\r\nLisa, who had assumed a look of contemptuous scorn, said but little,\r\nsimply encouraging Mademoiselle Saget\u2019s gossip by her silence. At last,\r\nhowever, she interrupted her. \u201CNo, no,\u201D she said; \u201CI can\u2019t really\r\nlisten to all that. Is it possible that there can be such women?\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon Mademoiselle Saget told Lisa that unfortunately all women\r\nwere not so well conducted as herself. And then she pretended to find\r\nall sorts of excuses for Florent: it wasn\u2019t his fault; he was no doubt\r\na bachelor; these women had very likely inveigled him in their snares.\r\nIn this way she hinted questions without openly asking them. But Lisa\r\npreserved silence with respect to her cousin, merely shrugging her\r\nshoulders and compressing her lips. When Mademoiselle Saget at last\r\nwent away, the mistress of the shop glanced with disgust at the cover\r\nof the heating-pan, the glistening metal of which had been tarnished by\r\nthe impression of the old woman\u2019s little hands.\r\n\r\n\u201CAugustine,\u201D she cried, \u201Cbring a duster, and wipe the cover of the\r\nheating-pan. It\u2019s quite filthy!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between the beautiful Lisa and the beautiful Norman now\r\nbecame formidable. The beautiful Norman flattered herself that she had\r\ncarried a lover off from her enemy; and the beautiful Lisa was\r\nindignant with the hussy who, by luring the sly cousin to her home,\r\nwould surely end by compromising them all. The natural temperament of\r\neach woman manifested itself in the hostilities which ensued. The one\r\nremained calm and scornful, like a lady who holds up her skirts to keep\r\nthem from being soiled by the mud; while the other, much less subject\r\nto shame, displayed insolent gaiety and swaggered along the footways\r\nwith the airs of a duellist seeking a cause of quarrel. Each of their\r\nskirmishes would be the talk of the fish market for the whole day. When\r\nthe beautiful Norman saw the beautiful Lisa standing at the door of her\r\nshop, she would go out of her way in order to pass her, and brush\r\nagainst her with her apron; and then the angry glances of the two\r\nrivals crossed like rapiers, with the rapid flash and thrust of pointed\r\nsteel. When the beautiful Lisa, on the other hand, went to the fish\r\nmarket, she assumed an expression of disgust on approaching the\r\nbeautiful Norman\u2019s stall. And then she proceeded to purchase some big\r\nfish\u2014a turbot or a salmon\u2014of a neighbouring dealer, spreading her money\r\nout on the marble slab as she did so, for she had noticed that this\r\nseemed to have a painful effect upon the \u201Chussy,\u201D who ceased laughing\r\nat the sight. To hear the two rivals speak, anyone would have supposed\r\nthat the fish and pork they sold were quite unfit for food. However,\r\ntheir principal engagements took place when the beautiful Norman was\r\nseated at her stall and the beautiful Lisa at her counter, and they\r\nglowered blackly at each other across the Rue Rambuteau. They sat in\r\nstate in their big white aprons, decked out with showy toilets and\r\njewels, and the battle between them would commence early in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\u201CHallo, the fat woman\u2019s got up!\u201D the beautiful Norman would exclaim.\r\n\u201CShe ties herself up as tightly as her sausages! Ah, she\u2019s got\r\nSaturday\u2019s collar on again, and she\u2019s still wearing that poplin dress!\u201D\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, on the opposite side of the street, beautiful Lisa\r\nwas saying to her shop girl: \u201CJust look at that creature staring at us\r\nover yonder, Augustine! She\u2019s getting quite deformed by the life she\r\nleads. Do you see her earrings? She\u2019s wearing those big drops of hers,\r\nisn\u2019t she? It makes one feel ashamed to see a girl like that with\r\nbrilliants.\u201D\r\n\r\nAll complaisance, Augustine echoed her mistress\u2019s words.\r\n\r\nWhen either of them was able to display a new ornament it was like\r\nscoring a victory\u2014the other one almost choked with spleen. Every day\r\nthey would scrutinise and count each other\u2019s customers, and manifest\r\nthe greatest annoyance if they thought that the \u201Cbig thing over the\r\nway\u201D was doing the better business. Then they spied out what each had\r\nfor lunch. Each knew what the other ate, and even watched to see how\r\nshe digested it. In the afternoon, while the one sat amidst her cooked\r\nmeats and the other amidst her fish, they posed and gave themselves\r\nairs, as though they were queens of beauty. It was then that the\r\nvictory of the day was decided. The beautiful Norman embroidered,\r\nselecting the most delicate and difficult work, and this aroused Lisa\u2019s\r\nexasperation.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D she said, speaking of her rival, \u201Cshe had far better mend her\r\nboy\u2019s stockings. He\u2019s running about quite barefooted. Just look at that\r\nfine lady, with her red hands stinking of fish!\u201D\r\n\r\nFor her part, Lisa usually knitted.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s still at that same sock,\u201D La Normande would say, as she watched\r\nher. \u201CShe eats so much that she goes to sleep over her work. I pity her\r\npoor husband if he\u2019s waiting for those socks to keep his feet warm!\u201D\r\n\r\nThey would sit glowering at each other with this implacable hostility\r\nuntil evening, taking note of every customer, and displaying such keen\r\neyesight that they detected the smallest details of each other\u2019s dress\r\nand person when other women declared that they could see nothing at\r\nsuch a distance. Mademoiselle Saget expressed the highest admiration\r\nfor Madame Quenu\u2019s wonderful sight when she one day detected a scratch\r\non the fish-girl\u2019s left cheek. With eyes like those, said the old maid,\r\none might even see through a door. However, the victory often remained\r\nundecided when night fell; sometimes one or other of the rivals was\r\ntemporarily crushed, but she took her revenge on the morrow. Several\r\npeople of the neighbourhood actually laid wagers on these contests,\r\nsome backing the beautiful Lisa and others the beautiful Norman.\r\n\r\nAt last they ended by forbidding their children to speak to one\r\nanother. Pauline and Muche had formerly been good friends,\r\nnotwithstanding the girl\u2019s stiff petticoats and lady-like demeanour,\r\nand the lad\u2019s tattered appearance, coarse language, and rough manners.\r\nThey had at times played together at horses on the broad footway in\r\nfront of the fish market, Pauline always being the horse and Muche the\r\ndriver. One day, however, when the boy came in all simplicity to seek\r\nhis playmate, Lisa turned him out of the house, declaring that he was a\r\ndirty little street arab.\r\n\r\n\u201COne can\u2019t tell what may happen with children who have been so\r\nshockingly brought up,\u201D she observed.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, indeed; you are quite right,\u201D replied Mademoiselle Saget, who\r\nhappened to be present.\r\n\r\nWhen Muche, who was barely seven years old, came in tears to his mother\r\nto tell her of what had happened, La Normande broke out into a terrible\r\npassion. At the first moment she felt a strong inclination to rush over\r\nto the Quenu-Gradelles\u2019 and smash everything in their shop. But\r\neventually she contented herself with giving Muche a whipping.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf ever I catch you going there again,\u201D she cried, boiling over with\r\nanger, \u201Cyou\u2019ll get it hot from me, I can tell you!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent, however, was the real victim of the two women. It was he, in\r\ntruth, who had set them by the ears, and it was on his account that\r\nthey were fighting each other. Ever since he had appeared upon the\r\nscene things had been going from bad to worse. He compromised and\r\ndisturbed and embittered all these people, who had previously lived in\r\nsuch sleek peace and harmony. The beautiful Norman felt inclined to\r\nclaw him when he lingered too long with the Quenus, and it was chiefly\r\nfrom an impulse of hostile rivalry that she desired to win him to\r\nherself. The beautiful Lisa, on her side, maintained a cold judicial\r\nbearing, and although extremely annoyed, forced herself to silence\r\nwhenever she saw Florent leaving the pork shop to go to the Rue\r\nPirouette.\r\n\r\nStill, there was now much less cordiality than formerly round the\r\nQuenus\u2019 dinner-table in the evening. The clean, prim dining-room seemed\r\nto have assumed an aspect of chilling severity. Florent divined a\r\nreproach, a sort of condemnation in the bright oak, the polished lamp,\r\nand the new matting. He scarcely dared to eat for fear of letting\r\ncrumbs fall on the floor or soiling his plate. There was a guileless\r\nsimplicity about him which prevented him from seeing how the land\r\nreally lay. He still praised Lisa\u2019s affectionate kindliness on all\r\nsides; and outwardly, indeed, she did continue to treat him with all\r\ngentleness.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is very strange,\u201D she said to him one day with a smile, as though\r\nshe were joking; \u201Calthough you don\u2019t eat at all badly now, you don\u2019t\r\nget fatter. Your food doesn\u2019t seem to do you any good.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Quenu laughed aloud, and tapping his brother\u2019s stomach,\r\nprotested that the whole contents of the pork shop might pass through\r\nit without depositing a layer of fat as thick as a two-sou piece.\r\nHowever, Lisa\u2019s insistence on this particular subject was instinct with\r\nthat same suspicious dislike for fleshless men which Madame Mehudin\r\nmanifested more outspokenly; and behind it all there was likewise a\r\nveiled allusion to the disorderly life which she imagined Florent was\r\nleading. She never, however, spoke a word to him about La Normande.\r\nQuenu had attempted a joke on the subject one evening, but Lisa had\r\nreceived it so icily that the good man had not ventured to refer to the\r\nmatter again. They would remain seated at table for a few moments after\r\ndessert, and Florent, who had noticed his sister-in-law\u2019s vexation if\r\never he went off too soon, tried to find something to talk about. On\r\nthese occasions Lisa would be near him, and certainly he did not suffer\r\nin her presence from that fishy smell which assailed him when he was in\r\nthe company of La Normande. The mistress of the pork shop, on the\r\ncontrary, exhaled an odour of fat and rich meats. Moreover, not a\r\nthrill of life stirred her tight-fitting bodice; she was all\r\nmassiveness and all sedateness. Gavard once said to Florent in\r\nconfidence that Madame Quenu was no doubt handsome, but that for his\r\npart he did not admire such armour-plated women.\r\n\r\nLisa avoided talking to Quenu of Florent. She habitually prided herself\r\non her patience, and considered, too, that it would not be proper to\r\ncause any unpleasantness between the brothers, unless some peremptory\r\nreason for her interference should arise. As she said, she could put up\r\nwith a good deal, but, of course, she must not be tried too far. She\r\nhad now reached the period of courteous tolerance, wearing an\r\nexpressionless face, affecting perfect indifference and strict\r\npoliteness, and carefully avoiding everything which might seem to hint\r\nthat Florent was boarding and lodging with them without their receiving\r\nthe slightest payment from him. Not, indeed, that she would have\r\naccepted any payment from him, she was above all that; still he might,\r\nat any rate, she thought, have lunched away from the house.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe never seem to be alone now,\u201D she remarked to Quenu one day. \u201CIf\r\nthere is anything we want to say to one another we have to wait till we\r\ngo upstairs at night.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd then, one night when they were in bed, she said to him: \u201CYour\r\nbrother earns a hundred and fifty francs a month, doesn\u2019t he? Well,\r\nit\u2019s strange he can\u2019t put a trifle by to buy himself some more linen.\r\nI\u2019ve been obliged to give him three more of your old shirts.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, that doesn\u2019t matter,\u201D Quenu replied. \u201CFlorent\u2019s not hard to\r\nplease; and we must let him keep his money for himself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes, of course,\u201D said Lisa, without pressing the matter further.\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t mention it for that reason. Whether he spends his money well\r\nor ill, it isn\u2019t our business.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn her own mind she felt quite sure that he wasted his salary at the\r\nMehudins\u2019.\r\n\r\nOnly on one occasion did she break through her habitual calmness of\r\ndemeanour, the quiet reserve which was the result of both natural\r\ntemperament and preconceived design. The beautiful Norman had made\r\nFlorent a present of a magnificent salmon. Feeling very much\r\nembarrassed with the fish, and not daring to refuse it, he brought it\r\nto Lisa.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou can make a pasty of it,\u201D he said ingenuously.\r\n\r\nLisa looked at him sternly with whitening lips. Then, striving to\r\nrestrain her anger, she exclaimed: \u201CDo you think that we are short of\r\nfood? Thank God, we\u2019ve got quite enough to eat here! Take it back!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, at any rate, cook it for me,\u201D replied Florent, amazed by her\r\nanger; \u201CI\u2019ll eat it myself.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this she burst out furiously.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe house isn\u2019t an inn! Tell those who gave you the fish to cook it\r\nfor you! I won\u2019t have my pans tainted and infected! Take it back again!\r\nDo you hear?\u201D\r\n\r\nIf he had not gone away with it, she would certainly have seized it and\r\nhurled it into the street. Florent took it to Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, where\r\nRose was ordered to make a pasty of it; and one evening the pasty was\r\neaten in the little \u201Ccabinet,\u201D Gavard, who was present, \u201Cstanding\u201D some\r\noysters for the occasion. Florent now gradually came more and more\r\nfrequently to Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, till at last he was constantly to be\r\nmet in the little private room. He there found an atmosphere of heated\r\nexcitement in which his political feverishness could pulsate freely. At\r\ntimes, now, when he shut himself up in his garret to work, the quiet\r\nsimplicity of the little room irritated him, his theoretical search for\r\nliberty proved quite insufficient, and it became necessary that he\r\nshould go downstairs, sally out, and seek satisfaction in the trenchant\r\naxioms of Charvet and the wild outbursts of Logre. During the first few\r\nevenings the clamour and chatter had made him feel ill at ease; he was\r\nthen quite conscious of their utter emptiness, but he felt a need of\r\ndrowning his thoughts, of goading himself on to some extreme resolution\r\nwhich might calm his mental disquietude. The atmosphere of the little\r\nroom, reeking with the odour of spirits and warm with tobacco smoke,\r\nintoxicated him and filled him with peculiar beatitude, prompting a\r\nkind of self-surrender which made him willing to acquiesce in the\r\nwildest ideas. He grew attached to those he met there, and looked for\r\nthem and awaited their coming with a pleasure which increased with\r\nhabit. Robine\u2019s mild, bearded countenance, Clemence\u2019s serious profile,\r\nCharvet\u2019s fleshless pallor, Logre\u2019s hump, Gavard, Alexandre, and\r\nLacaille, all entered into his life, and assumed a larger and larger\r\nplace in it. He took quite a sensual enjoyment in these meetings. When\r\nhis fingers closed round the brass knob on the door of the little\r\ncabinet it seemed to be animated with life, to warm him, and turn of\r\nits own accord. Had he grasped the supple wrist of a woman he could not\r\nhave felt a more thrilling emotion.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, very serious things took place in that little room.\r\nOne evening, Logre, after indulging in wilder outbursts than usual,\r\nbanged his fist upon the table, declaring that if they were men they\r\nwould make a clean sweep of the Government. And he added that it was\r\nnecessary they should come to an understanding without further delay,\r\nif they desired to be fully prepared when the time for action arrived.\r\nThen they all bent their heads together, discussed the matter in lower\r\ntones, and decided to form a little \u201Cgroup,\u201D which should be ready for\r\nwhatever might happen. From that day forward Gavard flattered himself\r\nthat he was a member of a secret society, and was engaged in a\r\nconspiracy. The little circle received no new members, but Logre\r\npromised to put it into communication with other associations with\r\nwhich he was acquainted; and then, as soon as they held all Paris in\r\ntheir grasp, they would rise and make the Tuileries\u2019 people dance. A\r\nseries of endless discussions, renewed during several months, then\r\nbegan\u2014discussions on questions of organisation, on questions of ways\r\nand means, on questions of strategy, and of the form of the future\r\nGovernment. As soon as Rose had brought Clemence\u2019s grog, Charvet\u2019s and\r\nRobine\u2019s beer, the coffee for Logre, Gavard, and Florent, and the\r\nliqueur glasses of brandy for Lacaille and Alexandre, the door of the\r\ncabinet was carefully fastened, and the debate began.\r\n\r\nCharvet and Florent were naturally those whose utterances were listened\r\nto with the greatest attention. Gavard had not been able to keep his\r\ntongue from wagging, but had gradually related the whole story of\r\nCayenne; and Florent found himself surrounded by a halo of martyrdom.\r\nHis words were received as though they were the expression of\r\nindisputable dogmas. One evening, however, the poultry dealer, vexed at\r\nhearing his friend, who happened to be absent, attacked, exclaimed:\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t say anything against Florent; he\u2019s been to Cayenne!\u201D\r\n\r\nCharvet was rather annoyed by the advantage which this circumstance\r\ngave to Florent. \u201CCayenne, Cayenne,\u201D he muttered between his teeth.\r\n\u201CAh, well, they were not so badly off there, after all.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he attempted to prove that exile was a mere nothing, and that real\r\nsuffering consisted in remaining in one\u2019s oppressed country, gagged in\r\npresence of triumphant despotism. And besides, he urged, it wasn\u2019t his\r\nfault that he hadn\u2019t been arrested on the Second of December. Next,\r\nhowever, he hinted that those who had allowed themselves to be captured\r\nwere imbeciles. His secret jealousy made him a systematic opponent of\r\nFlorent; and the general discussions always ended in a duel between\r\nthese two, who, while their companions listened in silence, would speak\r\nagainst one another for hours at a time, without either of them\r\nallowing that he was beaten.\r\n\r\nOne of the favourite subjects of discussion was that of the\r\nreorganisation of the country which would have to be effected on the\r\nmorrow of their victory.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe are the conquerors, are we not?\u201D began Gavard.\r\n\r\nAnd, triumph being taken for granted, everyone offered his opinion.\r\nThere were two rival parties. Charvet, who was a disciple of H\u00E9bert,\r\nwas supported by Logre and Robine; while Florent, who was always\r\nabsorbed in humanitarian dreams, and called himself a Socialist, was\r\nbacked by Alexandre and Lacaille. As for Gavard, he felt no repugnance\r\nfor violent action; but, as he was often twitted about his fortune with\r\nno end of sarcastic witticisms which annoyed him, he declared himself a\r\nCommunist.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe must make a clean sweep of everything,\u201D Charvet would curtly say,\r\nas though he were delivering a blow with a cleaver. \u201CThe trunk is\r\nrotten, and it must come down.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes! yes!\u201D cried Logre, standing up that he might look taller, and\r\nmaking the partition shake with the excited motion of his hump.\r\n\u201CEverything will be levelled to the ground; take my word for it. After\r\nthat we shall see what to do.\u201D\r\n\r\nRobine signified approval by wagging his beard. His silence seemed\r\ninstinct with delight whenever violent revolutionary propositions were\r\nmade. His eyes assumed a soft ecstatic expression at the mention of the\r\nguillotine. He half closed them, as though he could see the machine,\r\nand was filled with pleasant emotion at the sight; and next he would\r\ngently rub his chin against the knob of his stick, with a subdued purr\r\nof satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201CAll the same,\u201D said Florent, in whose voice a vague touch of sadness\r\nlingered, \u201Cif you cut down the tree it will be necessary to preserve\r\nsome seed. For my part, I think that the tree ought to be preserved, so\r\nthat we may graft new life on it. The political revolution, you know,\r\nhas already taken place; to-day we have got to think of the labourer,\r\nthe working man. Our movement must be altogether a social one. I defy\r\nyou to reject the claims of the people. They are weary of waiting, and\r\nare determined to have their share of happiness.\u201D\r\n\r\nThese words aroused Alexandre\u2019s enthusiasm. With a beaming, radiant\r\nface he declared that this was true, that the people were weary of\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd we will have our share,\u201D added Lacaille, with a more menacing\r\nexpression. \u201CAll the revolutions that have taken place have been for\r\nthe good of the middle classes. We\u2019ve had quite enough of that sort of\r\nthing, and the next one shall be for our benefit.\u201D\r\n\r\nFrom this moment disagreement set in. Gavard offered to make a division\r\nof his property, but Logre declined, asserting that he cared nothing\r\nfor money. Then Charvet gradually overcame the tumult, till at last he\r\nalone was heard speaking.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe selfishness of the different classes does more than anything else\r\nto uphold tyranny,\u201D said he. \u201CIt is wrong of the people to display\r\negotism. If they assist us they shall have their share. But why should\r\nI fight for the working man if the working man won\u2019t fight for me?\r\nMoreover, that is not the question at present. Ten years of\r\nrevolutionary dictatorship will be necessary to accustom a nation like\r\nFrance to the fitting enjoyment of liberty.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAll the more so as the working man is not ripe for it, and requires to\r\nbe directed,\u201D said Clemence bluntly.\r\n\r\nShe but seldom spoke. This tall, serious looking girl, alone among so\r\nmany men, listened to all the political chatter with a learnedly\r\ncritical air. She leaned back against the partition, and every now and\r\nthen sipped her grog whilst gazing at the speakers with frowning brows\r\nor inflated nostrils, thus silently signifying her approval or\r\ndisapproval, and making it quite clear that she held decided opinions\r\nupon the most complicated matters. At times she would roll a cigarette,\r\nand puff slender whiffs of smoke from the corners of her mouth, whilst\r\nlending increased attention to what was being debated. It was as though\r\nshe were presiding over the discussion, and would award the prize to\r\nthe victor when it was finished. She certainly considered that it\r\nbecame her, as a woman, to display some reserve in her opinions, and to\r\nremain calm whilst the men grew more and more excited. Now and then,\r\nhowever, in the heat of the debate, she would let a word or a phrase\r\nescape her and \u201Cclench the matter\u201D even for Charvet himself, as Gavard\r\nsaid. In her heart she believed herself the superior of all these\r\nfellows. The only one of them for whom she felt any respect was Robine,\r\nand she would thoughtfully contemplate his silent bearing.\r\n\r\nNeither Florent nor any of the others paid any special attention to\r\nClemence. They treated her just as though she were a man, shaking hands\r\nwith her so roughly as almost to dislocate her arms. One evening\r\nFlorent witnessed the periodical settlement of accounts between her and\r\nCharvet. She had just received her pay, and Charvet wanted to borrow\r\nten francs from her; but she first of all insisted that they must\r\nreckon up how matters stood between them. They lived together in a\r\nvoluntary partnership, each having complete control of his or her\r\nearnings, and strictly paying his or her expenses. By so doing, said\r\nthey, they were under no obligations to one another, but retained\r\nentire freedom. Rent, food, washing, and amusements, were all noted\r\ndown and added up. That evening, when the accounts had been verified,\r\nClemence proved to Charvet that he already owed her five francs. Then\r\nshe handed him the other ten which he wished to borrow, and exclaimed:\r\n\u201CRecollect that you now owe me fifteen. I shall expect you to repay me\r\non the fifth, when you get paid for teaching little Lehudier.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen Rose was summoned to receive payment for the \u201Cdrinks,\u201D each\r\nproduced the few coppers required to discharge his or her liability.\r\nCharvet laughingly called Clemence an aristocrat because she drank\r\ngrog. She wanted to humiliate him, said he, and make him feel that he\r\nearned less than she did, which, as it happened, was the fact. Beneath\r\nhis laugh, however, there was a feeling of bitterness that the girl\r\nshould be better circumstanced than himself, for, in spite of his\r\ntheory of the equality of the sexes, this lowered him.\r\n\r\nAlthough the discussions in the little room had virtually no result,\r\nthey served to exercise the speakers\u2019 lungs. A tremendous hubbub\r\nproceeded from the sanctum, and the panes of frosted glass vibrated\r\nlike drum-skins. Sometimes the uproar became so great that Rose, while\r\nlanguidly serving some blouse-wearing customer in the shop, would turn\r\nher head uneasily.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, they\u2019re surely fighting together in there,\u201D the customer would\r\nsay, as he put his glass down on the zinc-covered counter, and wiped\r\nhis mouth with the back of his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, there\u2019s no fear of that,\u201D Monsieur Lebigre tranquilly replied.\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s only some gentlemen talking together.\u201D\r\n\r\nMonsieur Lebigre, indeed, although very strict with his other\r\ncustomers, allowed the politicians to shout as loudly as they pleased,\r\nand never made the least remark on the subject. He would sit for hours\r\ntogether on the bench behind the counter, with his big head lolling\r\ndrowsily against the mirror, whilst he watched Rose uncorking the\r\nbottles and giving a wipe here and there with her duster. And in spite\r\nof the somniferous effects of the wine fumes and the warm streaming\r\ngaslight, he would keep his ears open to the sounds proceeding from the\r\nlittle room. At times, when the voices grew noisier than usual, he got\r\nup from his seat and went to lean against the partition; and\r\noccasionally he even pushed the door open, and went inside and sat down\r\nthere for a few minutes, giving Gavard a friendly slap on the thigh.\r\nAnd then he would nod approval of everything that was said. The poultry\r\ndealer asserted that although friend Lebigre hadn\u2019t the stuff of an\r\norator in him, they might safely reckon on him when the \u201Cshindy\u201D came.\r\n\r\nOne morning, however, at the markets, when a tremendous row broke out\r\nbetween Rose and one of the fish-wives, through the former accidentally\r\nknocking over a basket of herrings, Florent heard Rose\u2019s employer\r\nspoken of as a \u201Cdirty spy\u201D in the pay of the police. And after he had\r\nsucceeded in restoring peace, all sorts of stories about Monsieur\r\nLebigre were poured into his ears. Yes, the wine seller was in the pay\r\nof the police, the fish-wives said; all the neighbourhood knew it.\r\nBefore Mademoiselle Saget had begun to deal with him she had once met\r\nhim entering the Prefecture to make his report. It was asserted, too,\r\nthat he was a money-monger, a usurer, and lent petty sums by the day to\r\ncostermongers, and let out barrows to them, exacting a scandalous rate\r\nof interest in return. Florent was greatly disturbed by all this, and\r\nfelt it his duty to repeat it that evening to his fellow politicians.\r\nThe latter, however, only shrugged their shoulders, and laughed at his\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\n\u201CPoor Florent!\u201D Charvet exclaimed sarcastically; \u201Che imagines the whole\r\npolice force is on his track, just because he happens to have been sent\r\nto Cayenne!\u201D\r\n\r\nGavard gave his word of honour that Lebigre was perfectly staunch and\r\ntrue, while Logre, for his part, manifested extreme irritation. He\r\nfumed and declared that it would be quite impossible for them to get on\r\nif everyone was to be accused of being a police spy; for his own part,\r\nhe would rather stay at home, and have nothing more to do with\r\npolitics. Why, hadn\u2019t people even dared to say that he, Logre himself,\r\nwho had fought in \u201848 and \u201851, and had twice narrowly escaped\r\ntransportation, was a spy as well? As he shouted this out, he thrust\r\nhis jaws forward, and glared at the others as though he would have\r\nliked to ram the conviction that he had nothing to do with the police\r\ndown their throats. At the sight of his furious glances his companions\r\nmade gestures of protestation. However, Lacaille, on hearing Monsieur\r\nLebigre accused of usury, silently lowered his head.\r\n\r\nThe incident was forgotten in the discussions which ensued. Since Logre\r\nhad suggested a conspiracy, Monsieur Lebigre had grasped the hands of\r\nthe frequenters of the little room with more vigor than ever. Their\r\ncustom, to tell the truth, was of but small value to him, for they\r\nnever ordered more than one \u201Cdrink\u201D apiece. They drained the last drops\r\njust as they rose to leave, having been careful to allow a little to\r\nremain in their glasses, even during their most heated arguments. In\r\nthis wise the one \u201Cshout\u201D lasted throughout the evening. They shivered\r\nas they turned out into the cold dampness of the night, and for a\r\nmoment or two remained standing on the footway with dazzled eyes and\r\nbuzzing ears, as though surprised by the dark silence of the street.\r\nRose, meanwhile, fastened the shutters behind them. Then, quite\r\nexhausted, at a loss for another word they shook hands, separated, and\r\nwent their different ways, still mentally continuing the discussion of\r\nthe evening, and regretting that they could not ram their particular\r\ntheories down each other\u2019s throats. Robine walked away, with his bent\r\nback bobbing up and down, in the direction of the Rue Rambuteau; whilst\r\nCharvet and Clemence went off through the markets on their return to\r\nthe Luxembourg quarter, their heels sounding on the flag-stones in\r\nmilitary fashion, whilst they still discussed some question of politics\r\nor philosophy, walking along side by side, but never arm-in-arm.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy ripened very slowly. At the commencement of the summer\r\nthe plotters had got no further than agreeing that it was necessary a\r\nstroke should be attempted. Florent, who had at first looked upon the\r\nwhole business with a kind of distrust, had now, however, come to\r\nbelieve in the possibility of a revolutionary movement. He took up the\r\nmatter seriously; making notes, and preparing plans in writing, while\r\nthe others still did nothing but talk. For his part, he began to\r\nconcentrate his whole life in the one persistent idea which made his\r\nbrain throb night after night; and this to such a degree that he at\r\nlast took his brother Quenu with him to Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, as though\r\nsuch a course were quite natural. Certainly he had no thought of doing\r\nanything improper. He still looked upon Quenu as in some degree his\r\npupil, and may even have considered it his duty to start him on the\r\nproper path. Quenu was an absolute novice in politics, but after\r\nspending five or six evenings in the little room he found himself quite\r\nin accord with the others. When Lisa was not present he manifested much\r\ndocility, a sort of respect for his brother\u2019s opinions. But the\r\ngreatest charm of the affair for him was really the mild dissipation of\r\nleaving his shop and shutting himself up in the little room where the\r\nothers shouted so loudly, and where Clemence\u2019s presence, in his\r\nopinion, gave a tinge of rakishness and romance to the proceedings. He\r\nnow made all haste with his chitterlings in order that he might get\r\naway as early as possible, anxious to lose not a single word of the\r\ndiscussions, which seemed to him to be very brilliant, though he was\r\nnot always able to follow them. The beautiful Lisa did not fail to\r\nnotice his hurry to be gone, but as yet she refrained from saying\r\nanything. When Florent took him off, she simply went to the door-step,\r\nand watched them enter Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, her face paling somewhat,\r\nand a severe expression coming into her eyes.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as Mademoiselle Saget was peering out of her garret\r\ncasement, she recognised Quenu\u2019s shadow on the frosted glass of the\r\n\u201Ccabinet\u201D window facing the Rue Pirouette. She had found her casement\r\nan excellent post of observation, as it overlooked that milky\r\ntransparency, on which the gaslight threw silhouettes of the\r\npoliticians, with noses suddenly appearing and disappearing, gaping\r\njaws abruptly springing into sight and then vanishing, and huge arms,\r\napparently destitute of bodies, waving hither and thither. This\r\nextraordinary jumble of detached limbs, these silent but frantic\r\nprofiles, bore witness to the heated discussions that went on in the\r\nlittle room, and kept the old maid peering from behind her muslin\r\ncurtains until the transparency turned black. She shrewdly suspected\r\nsome \u201Cbit of trickery,\u201D as she phrased it. By continual watching she\r\nhad come to recognise the different shadows by their hands and hair and\r\nclothes. As she gazed upon the chaos of clenched fists, angry heads,\r\nand swaying shoulders, which seemed to have become detached from their\r\ntrunks and to roll about one atop of the other, she would exclaim\r\nunhesitatingly, \u201CAh, there\u2019s that big booby of a cousin; there\u2019s that\r\nmiserly old Gavard; and there\u2019s the hunchback; and there\u2019s that maypole\r\nof a Clemence!\u201D Then, when the action of the shadow-play became more\r\npronounced, and they all seemed to have lost control over themselves,\r\nshe felt an irresistible impulse to go downstairs to try to find out\r\nwhat was happening. Thus she now made a point of buying her\r\nblack-currant syrup at nights, pretending that she felt out-of-sorts in\r\nthe morning, and was obliged to take a sip as soon as ever she was out\r\nof bed. On the evening when she noticed Quenu\u2019s massive head shadowed\r\non the transparency in close proximity to Charvet\u2019s fist, she made her\r\nappearance at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s in a breathless condition. To gain\r\nmore time, she made Rose rinse out her little bottle for her; however,\r\nshe was about to return to her room when she heard the pork butcher\r\nexclaim with a sort of childish candour:\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, indeed, we\u2019ll stand for it no longer! We\u2019ll make a clean sweep of\r\nall those humbugging Deputies and Ministers! Yes, we\u2019ll send the whole\r\nlot packing.\u201D\r\n\r\nEight o\u2019clock had scarcely struck on the following morning when\r\nMademoiselle Saget was already at the pork shop. She found Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur and La Sarriette there, dipping their noses into the\r\nheating-pan, and buying hot sausages for breakfast. As the old maid had\r\nmanaged to draw them into her quarrel with La Normande with respect to\r\nthe ten-sou dab, they had at once made friends again with Lisa, and\r\nthey now had nothing but contempt for the handsome fish-girl, and\r\nassailed her and her sister as good-for-nothing hussies, whose only aim\r\nwas to fleece men of their money. This opinion had been inspired by the\r\nassertions of Mademoiselle Saget, who had declared to Madame Lec\u0153ur\r\nthat Florent had induced one of the two girls to coquette with Gavard,\r\nand that the four of them had indulged in the wildest dissipation at\r\nBarratte\u2019s\u2014of course, at the poultry dealer\u2019s expense. From the effects\r\nof this impudent story Madame Lec\u0153ur had not yet recovered; she wore a\r\ndoleful appearance, and her eyes were quite yellow with spleen.\r\n\r\nThat morning, however, it was for Madame Quenu that the old maid had a\r\nshock in store. She looked round the counter, and then in her most\r\ngentle voice remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CI saw Monsieur Quenu last night. They seem to enjoy themselves\r\nimmensely in that little room at Lebigre\u2019s, if one may judge from the\r\nnoise they make.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa had turned her head towards the street, listening very\r\nattentively, but apparently unwilling to show it. The old maid paused,\r\nhoping that one of the others would question her; and then, in a lower\r\ntone, she added: \u201CThey had a woman with them. Oh, I don\u2019t mean Monsieur\r\nQuenu, of course! I didn\u2019t say that; I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt must be Clemence,\u201D interrupted La Sarriette; \u201Ca big scraggy\r\ncreature who gives herself all sorts of airs just because she went to\r\nboarding school. She lives with a threadbare usher. I\u2019ve seen them\r\ntogether; they always look as though they were taking each other off to\r\nthe police station.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes; I know,\u201D replied the old maid, who, indeed, knew everything\r\nabout Charvet and Clemence, and whose only purpose was to alarm Lisa.\r\n\r\nThe mistress of the pork shop, however, never flinched. She seemed to\r\nbe absorbed in watching something of great interest in the market\r\nyonder. Accordingly the old maid had recourse to stronger measures. \u201CI\r\nthink,\u201D said she, addressing herself to Madame Lec\u0153ur, \u201Cthat you ought\r\nto advise your brother-in-law to be careful. Last night they were\r\nshouting out the most shocking things in that little room. Men really\r\nseem to lose their heads over politics. If anyone had heard them, it\r\nmight have been a very serious matter for them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh! Gavard will go his own way,\u201D sighed Madame Lec\u0153ur. \u201CIt only wanted\r\nthis to fill my cup. I shall die of anxiety, I am sure, if he ever gets\r\narrested.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, a gleam shot from her dim eyes. La Sarriette, however,\r\nlaughed and wagged her little face, bright with the freshness of the\r\nmorning air.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou should hear what Jules says of those who speak against the\r\nEmpire,\u201D she remarked. \u201CThey ought all to be thrown into the Seine, he\r\ntold me; for it seems there isn\u2019t a single respectable person amongst\r\nthem.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh! there\u2019s no harm done, of course, so long as only people like\r\nmyself hear their foolish talk,\u201D resumed Mademoiselle Saget. \u201CI\u2019d\r\nrather cut my hand off, you know, than make mischief. Last night now,\r\nfor instance, Monsieur Quenu was saying\u2014\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nShe again paused. Lisa had started slightly.\r\n\r\n\u201CMonsieur Quenu was saying that the Ministers and Deputies and all who\r\nare in power ought to be shot.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Lisa turned sharply, her face quite white and her hands\r\nclenched beneath her apron.\r\n\r\n\u201CQuenu said that?\u201D she curtly asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, indeed, and several other similar things that I can\u2019t recollect\r\nnow. I heard him myself. But don\u2019t distress yourself like that, Madame\r\nQuenu. You know very well that I sha\u2019n\u2019t breathe a word. I\u2019m quite old\r\nenough to know what might harm a man if it came out. Oh, no; it will go\r\nno further.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa had recovered her equanimity. She took a pride in the happy\r\npeacefulness of her home; she would not acknowledge that there had ever\r\nbeen the slightest difference between herself and her husband. And so\r\nnow she shrugged her shoulders and said with a smile: \u201COh, it\u2019s all a\r\npack of foolish nonsense.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen the three others were in the street together they agreed that\r\nhandsome Lisa had pulled a very doleful face; and they were unanimously\r\nof opinion that the mysterious goings-on of the cousin, the Mehudins,\r\nGavard, and the Quenus would end in trouble. Madame Lec\u0153ur inquired\r\nwhat was done to the people who got arrested \u201Cfor politics,\u201D but on\r\nthis point Mademoiselle Saget could not enlighten her; she only knew\r\nthat they were never seen again\u2014no, never. And this induced La\r\nSarriette to suggest that perhaps they were thrown into the Seine, as\r\nJules had said they ought to be.\r\n\r\nLisa avoided all reference to the subject at breakfast and dinner that\r\nday; and even in the evening, when Florent and Quenu went off together\r\nto Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, there was no unwonted severity in her glance. On\r\nthat particular evening, however, the question of framing a\r\nconstitution for the future came under discussion, and it was one\r\no\u2019clock in the morning before the politicians could tear themselves\r\naway from the little room. The shutters had already been fastened, and\r\nthey were obliged to leave by a small door, passing out one at a time\r\nwith bent backs. Quenu returned home with an uneasy conscience. He\r\nopened the three or four doors on his way to bed as gently as possible,\r\nwalking on tip-toe and stretching out his hands as he passed through\r\nthe sitting-room, to avoid a collision with any of the furniture. The\r\nwhole house seemed to be asleep. When he reached the bedroom, he was\r\nannoyed to find that Lisa had not extinguished the candle, which was\r\nburning with a tall, mournful flame in the midst of the deep silence.\r\nAs Quenu took off his shoes, and put them down in a corner, the\r\ntime-piece struck half past one with such a clear, ringing sound that\r\nhe turned in alarm, almost frightened to move, and gazing with an\r\nexpression of angry reproach at the shining gilded Gutenberg standing\r\nthere, with his finger on a book. Lisa\u2019s head was buried in her pillow,\r\nand Quenu could only see her back; but he divined that she was merely\r\nfeigning sleep, and her conduct in turning her back upon him was so\r\ninstinct with reproach that he felt sorely ill at ease. At last he\r\nslipped beneath the bed-clothes, blew out the candle, and lay perfectly\r\nstill. He could have sworn that his wife was awake, though she did not\r\nspeak to him; and presently he fell asleep, feeling intensely\r\nmiserable, and lacking the courage to say good night.\r\n\r\nHe slept till late, and when he awoke he found himself sprawling in the\r\nmiddle of the bed with the eider-down quilt up to his chin, whilst Lisa\r\nsat in front of the secr\u00E9taire, arranging some papers. His slumber had\r\nbeen so heavy that he had not heard her rise. However, he now took\r\ncourage, and spoke to her from the depths of the alcove: \u201CWhy didn\u2019t\r\nyou wake me? What are you doing there?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorting the papers in these drawers,\u201D she replied in her usual\r\ntone of voice.\r\n\r\nQuenu felt relieved. But Lisa added: \u201COne never knows what may happen.\r\nIf the police were to come\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat! the police?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, indeed, the police; for you\u2019re mixing yourself up with politics\r\nnow.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Quenu sat up in bed, quite dazed and confounded by such a\r\nviolent and unexpected attack.\r\n\r\n\u201CI mix myself up with politics! I mix myself up with politics!\u201D he\r\nrepeated. \u201CIt\u2019s no concern of the police. I\u2019ve nothing to do with any\r\ncompromising matters.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D replied Lisa, shrugging her shoulders; \u201Cyou merely talk about\r\nshooting everybody.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI! I!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. And you bawl it out in a public-house! Mademoiselle Saget heard\r\nyou. All the neighbourhood knows by this time that you are a Red\r\nRepublican!\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu fell back in bed again. He was not perfectly awake as yet. Lisa\u2019s\r\nwords resounded in his ears as though he already heard the heavy tramp\r\nof gendarmes at the bedroom door. He looked at her as she sat there,\r\nwith her hair already arranged, her figure tightly imprisoned in her\r\nstays, her whole appearance the same as it was on any other morning;\r\nand he felt more astonished than ever that she should be so neat and\r\nprim under such extraordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\n\u201CI leave you absolutely free, you know,\u201D she continued, as she went on\r\narranging the papers. \u201CI don\u2019t want to wear the breeches, as the saying\r\ngoes. You are the master, and you are at liberty to endanger your\r\nposition, compromise our credit, and ruin our business.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as Quenu tried to protest, she silenced him with a gesture. \u201CNo,\r\nno; don\u2019t say anything,\u201D she continued. \u201CThis is no quarrel, and I am\r\nnot even asking an explanation from you. But if you had consulted me,\r\nand we had talked the matter over together, I might have intervened.\r\nAh! it\u2019s a great mistake to imagine that women understand nothing about\r\npolitics. Shall I tell you what my politics are?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe had risen from her seat whilst speaking, and was now walking to and\r\nfro between the bed and the window, wiping as she went some specks of\r\ndust from the bright mahogany of the mirrored wardrobe and the\r\ndressing-table.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy politics are the politics of honest folks,\u201D said she. \u201CI\u2019m grateful\r\nto the Government when business is prosperous, when I can eat my meals\r\nin peace and comfort, and can sleep at nights without being awakened by\r\nthe firing of guns. There were pretty times in \u201848, were there not? You\r\nremember our uncle Gradelle, the worthy man, showing us his books for\r\nthat year? He lost more than six thousand francs. Now that we have got\r\nthe Empire, however, everything prospers. We sell our goods readily\r\nenough. You can\u2019t deny it. Well, then, what is it that you want? How\r\nwill you be better off when you have shot everybody?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe took her stand in front of the little night-table, crossed her arms\r\nover her breast, and fixed her eyes upon Quenu, who had shuffled\r\nhimself beneath the bed-clothes, almost out of sight. He attempted to\r\nexplain what it was that his friends wanted, but he got quite confused\r\nin his endeavours to summarise Florent\u2019s and Charvet\u2019s political and\r\nsocial systems; and could only talk about the disregard shown to\r\nprinciples, the accession of the democracy to power, and the\r\nregeneration of society, in such a strange tangled way that Lisa\r\nshrugged her shoulders, quite unable to understand him. At last,\r\nhowever, he extricated himself from his difficulties by declaring that\r\nthe Empire was the reign of licentiousness, swindling finance, and\r\nhighway robbery. And, recalling an expression of Logre\u2019s he added: \u201CWe\r\nare the prey of a band of adventurers, who are pillaging, violating,\r\nand assassinating France. We\u2019ll have no more of them.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa, however, still shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, and is that all you have got to say?\u201D she asked with perfect\r\ncoolness. \u201CWhat has all that got to do with me? Even supposing it were\r\ntrue, what then? Have I ever advised you to practise dishonest courses?\r\nHave I ever prompted you to dishonour your acceptances, or cheat your\r\ncustomers, or pile up money by fraudulent practices? Really, you\u2019ll end\r\nby making me quite angry! We are honest folks, and we don\u2019t pillage or\r\nassassinate anybody. That\u2019s quite sufficient. What other folks do is no\r\nconcern of ours. If they choose to be rogues it\u2019s their affair.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe looked quite majestic and triumphant; and again pacing the room,\r\ndrawing herself up to her full height, she resumed: \u201CA pretty notion it\r\nis that people are to let their business go to rack and ruin just to\r\nplease those who are penniless. For my part, I\u2019m in favour of making\r\nhay while the sun shines, and supporting a Government which promotes\r\ntrade. If it does do dishonourable things, I prefer to know nothing\r\nabout them. I know that I myself commit none, and that no one in the\r\nneighbourhood can point a finger at me. It\u2019s only fools who go tilting\r\nat windmills. At the time of the last elections, you remember, Gavard\r\nsaid that the Emperor\u2019s candidate had been bankrupt, and was mixed up\r\nin all sorts of scandalous matters. Well, perhaps that was true, I\r\ndon\u2019t deny it; but all the same, you acted wisely in voting for him,\r\nfor all that was not in question; you were not asked to lend the man\r\nany money or to transact any business with him, but merely to show the\r\nGovernment that you were pleased with the prosperity of the pork\r\ntrade.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this moment Quenu called to mind a sentence of Charvet\u2019s, asserting\r\nthat \u201Cthe bloated bourgeois, the sleek shopkeepers, who backed up that\r\nGovernment of universal gormandising, ought to be hurled into the\r\nsewers before all others, for it was owing to them and their gluttonous\r\negotism that tyranny had succeeded in mastering and preying upon the\r\nnation.\u201D He was trying to complete this piece of eloquence when Lisa,\r\ncarried off by her indignation, cut him short.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t talk such stuff! My conscience doesn\u2019t reproach me with\r\nanything. I don\u2019t owe a copper to anybody; I\u2019m not mixed up in any\r\ndishonest business; I buy and sell good sound stuff; and I charge no\r\nmore than others do. What you say may perhaps apply to people like our\r\ncousins, the Saccards. They pretend to be even ignorant that I am in\r\nParis; but I am prouder than they are, and I don\u2019t care a rap for their\r\nmillions. It\u2019s said that Saccard speculates in condemned buildings, and\r\ncheats and robs everybody. I\u2019m not surprised to hear it, for he was\r\nalways that way inclined. He loves money just for the sake of wallowing\r\nin it, and then tossing it out of his windows, like the imbecile he is.\r\nI can understand people attacking men of his stamp, who pile up\r\nexcessive fortunes. For my part, if you care to know it, I have but a\r\nbad opinion of Saccard. But we\u2014we who live so quietly and peaceably,\r\nwho will need at least fifteen years to put by sufficient money to make\r\nourselves comfortably independent, we who have no reason to meddle in\r\npolitics, and whose only aim is to bring up our daughter respectably,\r\nand to see that our business prospers\u2014why you must be joking to talk\r\nsuch stuff about us. We are honest folks!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe came and sat down on the edge of the bed. Quenu was already much\r\nshaken in his opinions.\r\n\r\n\u201CListen to me, now,\u201D she resumed in a more serious voice. \u201CYou surely\r\ndon\u2019t want to see your own shop pillaged, your cellar emptied, and your\r\nmoney taken from you? If these men who meet at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s\r\nshould prove triumphant, do you think that you would then lie as\r\ncomfortably in your bed as you do now? And on going down into the\r\nkitchen, do you imagine that you would set about making your galantines\r\nas peacefully as you will presently? No, no, indeed! So why do you talk\r\nabout overthrowing a Government which protects you, and enables you to\r\nput money by? You have a wife and a daughter, and your first duty is\r\ntowards them. You would be in fault if you imperilled their happiness.\r\nIt is only those who have neither home nor hearth, who have nothing to\r\nlose, who want to be shooting people. Surely you don\u2019t want to pull the\r\nchestnuts out of the fire for _them_! So stay quietly at home, you\r\nfoolish fellow, sleep comfortably, eat well, make money, keep an easy\r\nconscience, and leave France to free herself of the Empire if the\r\nEmpire annoys her. France can get on very well without _you_.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe laughed her bright melodious laugh as she finished; and Quenu was\r\nnow altogether convinced. Yes, she was right, after all; and she looked\r\nso charming, he thought, as she sat there on the edge of the bed, so\r\ntrim, although it was so early, so bright, and so fresh in the dazzling\r\nwhiteness of her linen. As he listened to her his eyes fell on their\r\nportraits hanging on either side of the fireplace. Yes, they were\r\ncertainly honest folks; they had such a respectable, well-to-do air in\r\ntheir black clothes and their gilded frames! The bedroom, too, looked\r\nas though it belonged to people of some account in the world. The lace\r\nsquares seemed to give a dignified appearance to the chairs; and the\r\ncarpet, the curtains, and the vases decorated with painted\r\nlandscapes\u2014all spoke of their exertions to get on in the world and\r\ntheir taste for comfort. Thereupon he plunged yet further beneath the\r\neider-down quilt, which kept him in a state of pleasant warmth. He\r\nbegan to feel that he had risked losing all these things at Monsieur\r\nLebigre\u2019s\u2014his huge bed, his cosy room, and his business, on which his\r\nthoughts now dwelt with tender remorse. And from Lisa, from the\r\nfurniture, from all his cosy surroundings, he derived a sense of\r\ncomfort which thrilled him with a delightful, overpowering charm.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou foolish fellow!\u201D said his wife, seeing that he was now quite\r\nconquered. \u201CA pretty business it was that you\u2019d embarked upon; but\r\nyou\u2019d have had to reckon with Pauline and me, I can tell you! And now\r\ndon\u2019t bother your head any more about the Government. To begin with,\r\nall Governments are alike, and if we didn\u2019t have this one, we should\r\nhave another. A Government is necessary. But the one thing is to be\r\nable to live on, to spend one\u2019s savings in peace and comfort when one\r\ngrows old, and to know that one has gained one\u2019s means honestly.\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu nodded his head in acquiescence, and tried to commence a\r\njustification of his conduct.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was Gavard\u2014,\u201D he began.\r\n\r\nBut Lisa\u2019s face again assumed a serious expression, and she interrupted\r\nhim sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, it was not Gavard. I know very well who it was; and it would be a\r\ngreat deal better if he would look after his own safety before\r\ncompromising that of others.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs it Florent you mean?\u201D Quenu timidly inquired after a pause.\r\n\r\nLisa did not immediately reply. She got up and went back to the\r\nsecr\u00E9taire, as if trying to restrain herself.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, it is Florent,\u201D she said presently, in incisive tones. \u201CYou know\r\nhow patient I am. I would bear almost anything rather than come between\r\nyou and your brother. The tie of relationship is a sacred thing. But\r\nthe cup is filled to overflowing now. Since your brother came here\r\nthings have been constantly getting worse and worse. But now, I won\u2019t\r\nsay anything more; it is better that I shouldn\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. Then, as her husband gazed up at the ceiling\r\nwith an air of embarrassment, she continued, with increased violence:\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, he seems to ignore all that we have done for him. We have put\r\nourselves to great inconvenience for his sake; we have given him\r\nAugustine\u2019s bedroom, and the poor girl sleeps without a murmur in a\r\nstuffy little closet where she can scarcely breathe. We board and lodge\r\nhim and give him every attention\u2014but no, he takes it all quite as a\r\nmatter of course. He is earning money, but what he does with it nobody\r\nknows; or, rather, one knows only too well.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut there\u2019s his share of the inheritance, you know,\u201D Quenu ventured to\r\nsay, pained at hearing his brother attacked.\r\n\r\nLisa suddenly stiffened herself as though she were stunned, and her\r\nanger vanished.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, you are right; there is his share of the inheritance. Here is the\r\nstatement of it, in this drawer. But he refused to take it; you\r\nremember, you were present, and heard him. That only proves that he is\r\na brainless, worthless fellow. If he had had an idea in his head, he\r\nwould have made something out of that money by now. For my own part, I\r\nshould be very glad to get rid of it; it would be a relief to us. I\r\nhave told him so twice, but he won\u2019t listen to me. You ought to\r\npersuade him to take it. Talk to him about it, will you?\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu growled something in reply; and Lisa refrained from pressing the\r\npoint further, being of opinion that she had done all that could be\r\nexpected of her.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is not like other men,\u201D she resumed. \u201CHe\u2019s not a comfortable sort\r\nof person to have in the house. I shouldn\u2019t have said this if we hadn\u2019t\r\ngot talking on the subject. I don\u2019t busy myself about his conduct,\r\nthough it\u2019s setting the whole neighbourhood gossiping about us. Let him\r\neat and sleep here, and put us about, if he likes; we can get over\r\nthat; but what I won\u2019t tolerate is that he should involve us in his\r\npolitics. If he tries to lead you off again, or compromises us in the\r\nleast degree, I shall turn him out of the house without the least\r\nhesitation. I warn you, and now you understand!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent was doomed. Lisa was making a great effort to restrain herself,\r\nto prevent the animosity which had long been rankling in her heart from\r\nflowing forth. But Florent and his ways jarred against her every\r\ninstinct; he wounded her, frightened her, and made her quite miserable.\r\n\r\n\u201CA man who has made such a discreditable career,\u201D she murmured, \u201Cwho\r\nhas never been able to get a roof of his own over his head! I can very\r\nwell understand his partiality for bullets! He can go and stand in\r\ntheir way if he chooses; but let him leave honest folks to their\r\nfamilies! And then, he isn\u2019t pleasant to have about one! He reeks of\r\nfish in the evening at dinner! It prevents me from eating. He himself\r\nnever lets a mouthful go past him, though it\u2019s little better he seems\r\nto be for it all! He can\u2019t even grow decently stout, the wretched\r\nfellow, to such a degree do his bad instincts prey on him!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe had stepped up to the window whilst speaking, and now saw Florent\r\ncrossing the Rue Rambuteau on his way to the fish market. There was a\r\nvery large arrival of fish that morning; the tray-like baskets were\r\ncovered with rippling silver, and the auction rooms roared with the\r\nhubbub of their sales. Lisa kept her eyes on the bony shoulders of her\r\nbrother-in-law as he made his way into the pungent smells of the\r\nmarket, stooping beneath the sickening sensation which they brought\r\nhim; and the glance with which she followed his steps was that of a\r\nwoman bent on combat and resolved to be victorious.\r\n\r\nWhen she turned round again, Quenu was getting up. As he sat on the\r\nedge of the bed in his night-shirt, still warm from the pleasant heat\r\nof the eider-down quilt and with his feet resting on the soft fluffy\r\nrug below him, he looked quite pale, quite distressed at the\r\nmisunderstanding between his wife and his brother. Lisa, however, gave\r\nhim one of her sweetest smiles, and he felt deeply touched when she\r\nhanded him his socks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nMarjolin had been found in a heap of cabbages at the Market of the\r\nInnocents. He was sleeping under the shelter of a large white-hearted\r\none, a broad leaf of which concealed his rosy childish face It was\r\nnever known what poverty-stricken mother had laid him there. When he\r\nwas found he was already a fine little fellow of two or three years of\r\nage, very plump and merry, but so backward and dense that he could\r\nscarcely stammer a few words, and only seemed able to smile. When one\r\nof the vegetable saleswomen found him lying under the big white cabbage\r\nshe raised such a loud cry of surprise that her neighbours rushed up to\r\nsee what was the matter, while the youngster, still in petticoats, and\r\nwrapped in a scrap of old blanket, held out his arms towards her. He\r\ncould not tell who his mother was, but opened his eyes in wide\r\nastonishment as he squeezed against the shoulder of a stout tripe\r\ndealer who eventually took him up. The whole market busied itself about\r\nhim throughout the day. He soon recovered confidence, ate slices of\r\nbread and butter, and smiled at all the women. The stout tripe dealer\r\nkept him for a time, then a neighbour took him; and a month later a\r\nthird woman gave him shelter. When they asked him where his mother was,\r\nhe waved his little hand with a pretty gesture which embraced all the\r\nwomen present. He became the adopted child of the place, always\r\nclinging to the skirts of one or another of the women, and always\r\nfinding a corner of a bed and a share of a meal somewhere. Somehow,\r\ntoo, he managed to find clothes, and he even had a copper or two at the\r\nbottom of his ragged pockets. It was a buxom, ruddy girl dealing in\r\nmedicinal herbs who gave him the name of Marjolin,[*] though no one\r\nknew why.\r\n\r\n[*] Literally \u201CMarjoram.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Marjolin was nearly four years of age, old Mother Chantemesse also\r\nhappened to find a child, a little girl, lying on the footway of the\r\nRue Saint Denis, near the corner of the market. Judging by the little\r\none\u2019s size, she seemed to be a couple of years old, but she could\r\nalready chatter like a magpie, murdering her words in an incessant\r\nchildish babble. Old Mother Chantemesse after a time gathered that her\r\nname was Cadine, and that on the previous evening her mother had left\r\nher sitting on a doorstep, with instructions to wait till she returned.\r\nThe child had fallen asleep there, and did not cry. She related that\r\nshe was beaten at home; and she gladly followed Mother Chantemesse,\r\nseemingly quite enchanted with that huge square, where there were so\r\nmany people and such piles of vegetables. Mother Chantemesse, a retail\r\ndealer by trade, was a crusty but very worthy woman, approaching her\r\nsixtieth year. She was extremely fond of children, and had lost three\r\nboys of her own when they were mere babies. She came to the opinion\r\nthat the chit she had found \u201Cwas far too wide awake to kick the\r\nbucket,\u201D and so she adopted her.\r\n\r\nOne evening, however, as she was going off home with her right hand\r\nclasping Cadine\u2019s, Marjolin came up and unceremoniously caught hold of\r\nher left hand.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, my lad,\u201D said the old woman, stopping, \u201Cthe place is filled. Have\r\nyou left your big Therese, then? What a fickle little gadabout you\r\nare!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe boy gazed at her with his smiling eyes, without letting go of her\r\nhand. He looked so pretty with his curly hair that she could not resist\r\nhim. \u201CWell, come along, then, you little scamp,\u201D said she; \u201CI\u2019ll put\r\nyou to bed as well.\u201D\r\n\r\nThus she made her appearance in the Rue au Lard, where she lived, with\r\na child clinging to either hand. Marjolin made himself quite at home\r\nthere. When the two children proved too noisy the old woman cuffed\r\nthem, delighted to shout and worry herself, and wash the youngsters,\r\nand pack them away beneath the blankets. She had fixed them up a little\r\nbed in an old costermonger\u2019s barrow, the wheels and shafts of which had\r\ndisappeared. It was like a big cradle, a trifle hard, but retaining a\r\nstrong scent of the vegetables which it had long kept fresh and cool\r\nbeneath a covering of damp cloths. And there, when four years old,\r\nCadine and Marjolin slept locked in each other\u2019s arms.\r\n\r\nThey grew up together, and were always to be seen with their arms about\r\none another\u2019s waist. At night time old Mother Chantemesse heard them\r\nprattling softly. Cadine\u2019s clear treble went chattering on for hours\r\ntogether, while Marjolin listened with occasional expressions of\r\nastonishment vented in a deeper tone. The girl was a mischievous young\r\ncreature, and concocted all sorts of stories to frighten her companion;\r\ntelling him, for instance, that she had one night seen a man, dressed\r\nall in white, looking at them and putting out a great red tongue, at\r\nthe foot of the bed. Marjolin quite perspired with terror, and\r\nanxiously asked for further particulars; but the girl would then begin\r\nto jeer at him, and end by calling him a big donkey. At other times\r\nthey were not so peaceably disposed, but kicked each other beneath the\r\nblankets. Cadine would pull up her legs, and try to restrain her\r\nlaughter as Marjolin missed his aim, and sent his feet banging against\r\nthe wall. When this happened, old Madame Chantemesse was obliged to get\r\nup to put the bed-clothes straight again; and, by way of sending the\r\nchildren to sleep, she would administer a box on the ear to both of\r\nthem. For a long time their bed was a sort of playground. They carried\r\ntheir toys into it, and munched stolen carrots and turnips as they lay\r\nside by side. Every morning their adopted mother was amazed at the\r\nstrange things she found in the bed\u2014pebbles, leaves, apple cores, and\r\ndolls made out of scraps of rags. When the very cold weather came, she\r\nwent off to her work, leaving them sleeping there, Cadine\u2019s black mop\r\nmingling with Marjolin\u2019s sunny curls, and their mouths so near together\r\nthat they looked as though they were keeping each other warm with their\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nThe room in the Rue au Lard was a big, dilapidated garret, with a\r\nsingle window, the panes of which were dimmed by the rain. The children\r\nwould play at hide-and-seek in the tall walnut wardrobe and underneath\r\nMother Chantemesse\u2019s colossal bed. There were also two or three tables\r\nin the room, and they crawled under these on all fours. They found the\r\nplace a very charming playground, on account of the dim light and the\r\nvegetables scattered about in the dark corners. The street itself, too,\r\nnarrow and very quiet, with a broad arcade opening into the Rue de la\r\nLingerie, provided them with plenty of entertainment. The door of the\r\nhouse was by the side of the arcade; it was a low door and could only\r\nbe opened half way owing to the near proximity of the greasy corkscrew\r\nstaircase. The house, which had a projecting pent roof and a bulging\r\nfront, dark with damp, and displaying greenish drain-sinks near the\r\nwindows of each floor, also served as a big toy for the young couple.\r\nThey spent their mornings below in throwing stones up into the\r\ndrain-sinks, and the stones thereupon fell down the pipes with a very\r\nmerry clatter. In thus amusing themselves, however, they managed to\r\nbreak a couple of windows, and filled the drains with stones, so that\r\nMother Chantemesse, who had lived in the house for three and forty\r\nyears, narrowly escaped being turned out of it.\r\n\r\nCadine and Marjolin then directed their attention to the vans and drays\r\nand tumbrels which were drawn up in the quiet street. They clambered on\r\nto the wheels, swung from the dangling chains, and larked about amongst\r\nthe piles of boxes and hampers. Here also were the back premises of the\r\ncommission agents of the Rue de la Poterie\u2014huge, gloomy warehouses,\r\neach day filled and emptied afresh, and affording a constant succession\r\nof delightful hiding-places, where the youngsters buried themselves\r\namidst the scent of dried fruits, oranges, and fresh apples. When they\r\ngot tired of playing in his way, they went off to join old Madame\r\nChantemesse at the Market of the Innocents. They arrived there\r\narm-in-arm, laughing gaily as they crossed the streets with never the\r\nslightest fear of being run over by the endless vehicles. They knew the\r\npavement well, and plunged their little legs knee-deep in the vegetable\r\nrefuse without ever slipping. They jeered merrily at any porter in\r\nheavy boots who, in stepping over an artichoke stem, fell sprawling\r\nfull-length upon the ground. They were the rosy-cheeked familiar\r\nspirits of those greasy streets. They were to be seen everywhere.\r\n\r\nOn rainy days they walked gravely beneath the shelter of a ragged old\r\numbrella, with which Mother Chantemesse had protected her\r\nstock-in-trade for twenty years, and sticking it up in a corner of the\r\nmarket they called it their house. On sunny days they romped to such a\r\ndegree that when evening came they were almost too tired to move. They\r\nbathed their feet in the fountains, dammed up the gutters, or hid\r\nthemselves beneath piles of vegetables, and remained there prattling to\r\neach other just as they did in bed at night. People passing some huge\r\nmountain of cos or cabbage lettuces often heard a muffled sound of\r\nchatter coming from it. And when the green-stuff was removed, the two\r\nchildren would be discovered lying side by side on their couch of\r\nverdure, their eyes glistening uneasily like those of birds discovered\r\nin the depth of a thicket. As time went on, Cadine could not get along\r\nwithout Marjolin, and Marjolin began to cry when he lost sight of\r\nCadine. If they happened to get separated, they sought one another\r\nbehind the petticoats of every stallkeeper in the markets, amongst the\r\nboxes and under the cabbages. If was, indeed, chiefly under the\r\ncabbages that they grew up and learned to love each other.\r\n\r\nMarjolin was nearly eight years old, and Cadine six, when old Madame\r\nChantemesse began to reproach them for their idleness. She told them\r\nthat she would interest them in her business, and pay them a sou a day\r\nto assist her in paring her vegetables. During the first few days the\r\nchildren displayed eager zeal; they squatted down on either side of the\r\nbig flat basket with little knives in their hands, and worked away\r\nenergetically. Mother Chantemesse made a specialty of pared vegetables;\r\non her stall, covered with a strip of damp black lining, were little\r\nlots of potatoes, turnips, carrots, and white onions, arranged in\r\npyramids of four\u2014three at the base and one at the apex, all quite ready\r\nto be popped into the pans of dilatory housewives. She also had bundles\r\nduly stringed in readiness for the soup-pot\u2014four leeks, three carrots,\r\na parsnip, two turnips, and a couple of springs of celery. Then there\r\nwere finely cut vegetables for julienne soup laid out on squares of\r\npaper, cabbages cut into quarters, and little heaps of tomatoes and\r\nslices of pumpkin which gleamed like red stars and golden crescents\r\namidst the pale hues of the other vegetables. Cadine evinced much more\r\ndexterity than Marjolin, although she was younger. The peelings of the\r\npotatoes she pared were so thin that you could see through them; she\r\ntied up the bundles for the soup-pot so artistically that they looked\r\nlike bouquets; and she had a way of making the little heaps she set up,\r\nthough they contained but three carrots or turnips, look like very big\r\nones. The passers-by would stop and smile when she called out in her\r\nshrill childish voice: \u201CMadame! madame! come and try me! Each little\r\npile for two sous.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe had her regular customers, and her little piles and bundles were\r\nwidely known. Old Mother Chantemesse, seated between the two children,\r\nwould indulge in a silent laugh which made her bosom rise almost to her\r\nchin, at seeing them working away so seriously. She paid them their\r\ndaily sous most faithfully. But they soon began to weary of the little\r\nheaps and bundles; they were growing up, and began to dream of some\r\nmore lucrative business. Marjolin remained very childish for his years,\r\nand this irritated Cadine. He had no more brains than a cabbage, she\r\noften said. And it was, indeed, quite useless for her to devise any\r\nplan for him to make money; he never earned any. He could not even do\r\nan errand satisfactorily. The girl, on the other hand, was very shrewd.\r\nWhen but eight years old she obtained employment from one of those\r\nwomen who sit on a bench in the neighbourhood of the markets provided\r\nwith a basket of lemons, and employ a troop of children to go about\r\nselling them. Carrying the lemons in her hands and offering them at two\r\nfor three sous, Cadine thrust them under every woman\u2019s nose, and ran\r\nafter every passer-by. Her hands empty, she hastened back for a fresh\r\nsupply. She was paid two sous for every dozen lemons that she sold, and\r\non good days she could earn some five or six sous. During the following\r\nyear she hawked caps at nine sous apiece, which proved a more\r\nprofitable business; only she had to keep a sharp look-out, as street\r\ntrading of this kind is forbidden unless one be licensed. However, she\r\nscented a policeman at a distance of a hundred yards; and the caps\r\nforthwith disappeared under her skirts, whilst she began to munch an\r\napple with an air of guileless innocence. Then she took to selling\r\npastry, cakes, cherry-tarts, gingerbread, and thick yellow maize\r\nbiscuits on wicker trays. Marjolin, however, ate up nearly the whole of\r\nher stock-in-trade. At last, when she was eleven years old, she\r\nsucceeded in realising a grand idea which had long been worrying her.\r\nIn a couple of months she put by four francs, bought a small\r\n_hotte_,[*] and then set up as a dealer in birds\u2019 food.\r\n\r\n[*] A basket carried on the back.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a big affair. She got up early in the morning and purchased her\r\nstock of groundsel, millet, and bird-cake from the wholesale dealers.\r\nThen she set out on her day\u2019s work, crossing the river, and\r\nperambulating the Latin Quarter from the Rue Saint Jacques to the Rue\r\nDauphine, and even to the Luxembourg. Marjolin used to accompany her,\r\nbut she would not let him carry the basket. He was only fit to call\r\nout, she said; and so, in his thick, drawling voice, he would raise the\r\ncry, \u201CChickweed for the little birds!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Cadine herself, with her flute-like voice, would start on a\r\nstrange scale of notes ending in a clear, protracted alto, \u201CChickweed\r\nfor the little birds!\u201D\r\n\r\nThey each took one side of the road, and looked up in the air as they\r\nwalked along. In those days Marjolin wore a big scarlet waistcoat which\r\nhung down to his knees; it had belonged to the defunct Monsieur\r\nChantemesse, who had been a cab-driver. Cadine for her part wore a\r\nwhite and blue check gown, made out of an old tartan of Madame\r\nChantemesse\u2019s. All the canaries in the garrets of the Latin Quarter\r\nknew them; and, as they passed along, repeating their cry, each echoing\r\nthe other\u2019s voice, every cage poured out a song.\r\n\r\nCadine sold water-cress, too. \u201CTwo sous a bunch! Two sous a bunch!\u201D And\r\nMarjolin went into the shops to offer it for sale. \u201CFine water-cress!\r\nHealth for the body! Fine fresh water-cress!\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, the new central markets had just been erected, and the girl\r\nwould stand gazing in ecstacy at the avenue of flower stalls which runs\r\nthrough the fruit pavilion. Here on either hand, from end to end, big\r\nclumps of flowers bloom as in the borders of a garden walk. It is a\r\nperfect harvest, sweet with perfume, a double hedge of blossoms,\r\nbetween which the girls of the neighbourhood love to walk, smiling the\r\nwhile, though almost stifled by the heavy perfume. And on the top tiers\r\nof the stalls are artificial flowers, with paper leaves, in which\r\ndewdrops are simulated by drops of gum; and memorial wreaths of black\r\nand white beads rippling with bluish reflections. Cadine\u2019s rosy\r\nnostrils would dilate with feline sensuality; she would linger as long\r\nas possible in that sweet freshness, and carry as much of the perfume\r\naway with her as she could. When her hair bobbed under Marjolin\u2019s nose\r\nhe would remark that it smelt of pinks. She said that she had given\r\nover using pomatum; that is was quite sufficient for her to stroll\r\nthrough the flower walk in order to scent her hair. Next she began to\r\nintrigue and scheme with such success that she was engaged by one of\r\nthe stallkeepers. And then Marjolin declared that she smelt sweet from\r\nhead to foot. She lived in the midst of roses, lilacs, wall-flowers,\r\nand lilies of the valley; and Marjolin would playfully smell at her\r\nskirts, feign a momentary hesitation, and then exclaim, \u201CAh, that\u2019s\r\nlily of the valley!\u201D Next he would sniff at her waist and bodice: \u201CAh,\r\nthat\u2019s wall-flowers!\u201D And at her sleeves and wrists: \u201CAh, that\u2019s\r\nlilac!\u201D And at her neck, and her cheeks and lips: \u201CAh, but that\u2019s\r\nroses!\u201D he would cry. Cadine used to laugh at him, and call him a\r\n\u201Csilly stupid,\u201D and tell him to get away, because he was tickling her\r\nwith the tip of his nose. As she spoke her breath smelt of jasmine. She\r\nwas verily a bouquet, full of warmth and life.\r\n\r\nShe now got up at four o\u2019clock every morning to assist her mistress in\r\nher purchases. Each day they bought armfuls of flowers from the\r\nsuburban florists, with bundles of moss, and bundles of fern fronds,\r\nand periwinkle leaves to garnish the bouquets. Cadine would gaze with\r\namazement at the diamonds and Valenciennes worn by the daughters of the\r\ngreat gardeners of Montreuil, who came to the markets amidst their\r\nroses.\r\n\r\nOn the saints\u2019 days of popular observance, such as Saint Mary\u2019s, Saint\r\nPeter\u2019s, and Saint Joseph\u2019s days, the sale of flowers began at two\r\no\u2019clock. More than a hundred thousand francs\u2019 worth of cut flowers\r\nwould be sold on the footways, and some of the retail dealers would\r\nmake as much as two hundred francs in a few hours. On days like those\r\nonly Cadine\u2019s curly locks peered over the mounds of pansies,\r\nmignonette, and marguerites. She was quite drowned and lost in the\r\nflood of flowers. Then she would spend all her time in mounting\r\nbouquets on bits of rush. In a few weeks she acquired considerable\r\nskillfulness in her business, and manifested no little originality. Her\r\nbouquets did not always please everybody, however. Sometimes they made\r\none smile, sometimes they alarmed the eyes. Red predominated in them,\r\nmottled with violent tints of blue, yellow, and violet of a barbaric\r\ncharm. On the mornings when she pinched Marjolin, and teased him till\r\nshe made him cry, she made up fierce-looking bouquets, suggestive of\r\nher own bad temper, bouquets with strong rough scents and glaring\r\nirritating colours. On other days, however, when she was softened by\r\nsome thrill of joy or sorrow, her bouquets would assume a tone of\r\nsilvery grey, very soft and subdued, and delicately perfumed.\r\n\r\nThen, too, she would set roses, as sanguineous as open hearts, in lakes\r\nof snow-white pinks; arrange bunches of tawny iris that shot up in\r\ntufts of flame from foliage that seemed scared by the brilliance of the\r\nflowers; work elaborate designs, as complicated as those of Smyrna\r\nrugs, adding flower to flower, as on a canvas; and prepare rippling\r\nfanlike bouquets spreading out with all the delicacy of lace. Here was\r\na cluster of flowers of delicious purity, there a fat nosegay, whatever\r\none might dream of for the hand of a marchioness or a fish-wife; all\r\nthe charming quaint fancies, in short, which the brain of a\r\nsharp-witted child of twelve, budding into womanhood, could devise.\r\n\r\nThere were only two flowers for which Cadine retained respect; white\r\nlilac, which by the bundle of eight or ten sprays cost from fifteen to\r\ntwenty francs in the winter time; and camellias, which were still more\r\ncostly, and arrived in boxes of a dozen, lying on beds of moss, and\r\ncovered with cotton wool. She handled these as delicately as though\r\nthey were jewels, holding her breath for fear of dimming their lustre,\r\nand fastening their short stems to springs of cane with the tenderest\r\ncare. She spoke of them with serious reverence. She told Marjolin one\r\nday that a speckless white camellia was a very rare and exceptionally\r\nlovely thing, and, as she was making him admire one, he exclaimed:\r\n\u201CYes; it\u2019s pretty; but I prefer your neck, you know. It\u2019s much more\r\nsoft and transparent than the camellia, and there are some little blue\r\nand pink veins just like the pencillings on a flower.\u201D Then, drawing\r\nnear and sniffing, he murmured: \u201CAh! you smell of orange blossom\r\nto-day.\u201D\r\n\r\nCadine was self-willed, and did not get on well in the position of a\r\nservant, so she ended by setting up in business on her own account. As\r\nshe was only thirteen at the time, and could not hope for a big trade\r\nand a stall in the flower avenue, she took to selling one-sou bunches\r\nof violets pricked into a bed of moss in an osier tray which she\r\ncarried hanging from her neck. All day long she wandered about the\r\nmarkets and their precincts with her little bit of hanging garden. She\r\nloved this continual stroll, which relieved the numbness of her limbs\r\nafter long hours spent, with bent knees, on a low chair, making\r\nbouquets. She fastened her violets together with marvellous deftness as\r\nshe walked along. She counted out six or eight flowers, according to\r\nthe season, doubled a sprig of cane in half, added a leaf, twisted some\r\ndamp thread round the whole, and broke off the thread with her strong\r\nyoung teeth. The little bunches seemed to spring spontaneously from the\r\nlayer of moss, so rapidly did she stick them into it.\r\n\r\nAlong the footways, amidst the jostling of the street traffic, her\r\nnimble fingers were ever flowering though she gave them not a glance,\r\nbut boldly scanned the shops and passers-by. Sometimes she would rest\r\nin a doorway for a moment; and alongside the gutters, greasy with\r\nkitchen slops, she sat, as it were a patch of springtime, a suggestion\r\nof green woods, and purple blossoms. Her flowers still betokened her\r\nframe of mind, her fits of bad temper and her thrills of tenderness.\r\nSometimes they bristled and glowered with anger amidst their crumpled\r\nleaves; at other times they spoke only of love and peacefulness as they\r\nsmiled in their prim collars. As Cadine passed along, she left a sweet\r\nperfume behind her; Marjolin followed her devoutly. From head to foot\r\nshe now exhaled but one scent, and the lad repeated that she was\r\nherself a violet, a great big violet.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you remember the day when we went to Romainville together?\u201D he\r\nwould say; \u201CRomainville, where there are so many violets. The scent was\r\njust the same. Oh! don\u2019t change again\u2014you smell too sweetly.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd she did not change again. This was her last trade. Still, she often\r\nneglected her osier tray to go rambling about the neighbourhood. The\r\nbuilding of the central markets\u2014as yet incomplete\u2014provided both\r\nchildren with endless opportunities for amusement. They made their way\r\ninto the midst of the work-yards through some gap or other between the\r\nplanks; they descended into the foundations, and climbed up to the\r\ncast-iron pillars. Every nook, every piece of the framework witnessed\r\ntheir games and quarrels; the pavilions grew up under the touch of\r\ntheir little hands. From all this arose the affection which they felt\r\nfor the great markets, and which the latter seemed to return. They were\r\non familiar terms with that gigantic pile, old friends as they were,\r\nwho had seen each pin and bolt put into place. They felt no fear of the\r\nhuge monster; but slapped it with their childish hands, treated it like\r\na good friend, a chum whose presence brought no constraint. And the\r\nmarkets seemed to smile at these two light-hearted children, whose love\r\nwas the song, the idyll of their immensity.\r\n\r\nCadine alone now slept at Mother Chantemesse\u2019s. The old woman had\r\npacked Marjolin off to a neighbour\u2019s. This made the two children very\r\nunhappy. Still, they contrived to spend much of their time together. In\r\nthe daytime they would hide themselves away in the warehouses of the\r\nRue au Lard, behind piles of apples and cases of oranges; and in the\r\nevening they would dive into the cellars beneath the poultry market,\r\nand secret themselves among the huge hampers of feathers which stood\r\nnear the blocks where the poultry was killed. They were quite alone\r\nthere, amidst the strong smell of the poultry, and with never a sound\r\nbut the sudden crowing of some rooster to break upon their babble and\r\ntheir laughter. The feathers amidst which they found themselves were of\r\nall sorts\u2014turkey\u2019s feathers, long and black; goose quills, white and\r\nflexible; the downy plumage of ducks, soft like cotton wool; and the\r\nruddy and mottled feathers of fowls, which at the faintest breath flew\r\nup in a cloud like a swarm of flies buzzing in the sun. And then in\r\nwintertime there was the purple plumage of the pheasants, the ashen\r\ngrey of the larks, the splotched silk of the partridges, quails, and\r\nthrushes. And all these feathers freshly plucked were still warm and\r\nodoriferous, seemingly endowed with life. The spot was as cosy as a\r\nnest; at times a quiver as of flapping wings sped by, and Marjolin and\r\nCadine, nestling amidst all the plumage, often imagined that they were\r\nbeing carried aloft by one of those huge birds with outspread pinions\r\nthat one hears of in the fairy tales.\r\n\r\nAs time went on their childish affection took the inevitable turn.\r\nVeritable offsprings of Nature, knowing naught of social conventions\r\nand restraints, they loved one another in all innocence and\r\nguilelessness. They mated even as the birds of the air mate, even as\r\nyouth and maid mated in primeval times, because such is Nature\u2019s law.\r\nAt sixteen Cadine was a dusky town gipsy, greedy and sensual, whilst\r\nMarjolin, now eighteen, was a tall, strapping fellow, as handsome a\r\nyouth as could be met, but still with his mental faculties quite\r\nundeveloped. He had lived, indeed, a mere animal life, which had\r\nstrengthened his frame, but left his intellect in a rudimentary state.\r\n\r\nWhen old Madame Chantemesse realised the turn that things were taking\r\nshe wrathfully upbraided Cadine and struck out vigorously at her with\r\nher broom. But the hussy only laughed and dodged the blows, and then\r\nhied off to her lover. And gradually the markets became their home,\r\ntheir manger, their aviary, where they lived and loved amidst the meat,\r\nthe butter, the vegetables, and the feathers.\r\n\r\nThey discovered another little paradise in the pavilion where butter,\r\neggs, and cheese were sold wholesale. Enormous walls of empty baskets\r\nwere here piled up every morning, and amidst these Cadine and Marjolin\r\nburrowed and hollowed out a dark lair for themselves. A mere partition\r\nof osier-work separated them from the market crowd, whose loud voices\r\nrang out all around them. They often shook with laughter when people,\r\nwithout the least suspicion of their presence, stopped to talk together\r\na few yards away from them. On these occasions they would contrive\r\npeepholes, and spy through them, and when cherries were in season\r\nCadine tossed the stones in the faces of all the old women who passed\r\nalong\u2014a pastime which amused them the more as the startled old crones\r\ncould never make out whence the hail of cherry-stones had come. They\r\nalso prowled about the depths of the cellars, knowing every gloomy\r\ncorner of them, and contriving to get through the most carefully locked\r\ngates. One of their favourite amusements was to visit the track of the\r\nsubterranean railway, which had been laid under the markets, and which\r\nthose who planned the latter had intended to connect with the different\r\ngoods\u2019 stations of Paris. Sections of this railway were laid beneath\r\neach of the covered ways, between the cellars of each pavilion; the\r\nwork, indeed, was in such an advanced state that turn-tables had been\r\nput into position at all the points of intersection, and were in\r\nreadiness for use. After much examination, Cadine and Marjolin had at\r\nlast succeeded in discovering a loose plank in the hoarding which\r\nenclosed the track, and they had managed to convert it into a door, by\r\nwhich they could easily gain access to the line. There they were quite\r\nshut off from the world, though they could hear the continuous rumbling\r\nof the street traffic over their heads.\r\n\r\nThe line stretched through deserted vaults, here and there illumined by\r\na glimmer of light filtering through iron gratings, while in certain\r\ndark corners gas jets were burning. And Cadine and Marjolin rambled\r\nabout as in the secret recesses of some castle of their own, secure\r\nfrom all interruption, and rejoicing in the buzzy silence, the murky\r\nglimmer, and subterranean secrecy, which imparted a touch of melodrama\r\nto their experiences. All sorts of smells were wafted through the\r\nhoarding from the neighbouring cellars; the musty smell of vegetables,\r\nthe pungency of fish, the overpowering stench of cheese, and the warm\r\nreek of poultry.\r\n\r\nAt other times, on clear nights and fine dawns, they would climb on to\r\nthe roofs, ascending thither by the steep staircases of the turrets at\r\nthe angles of the pavilions. Up above they found fields of leads,\r\nendless promenades and squares, a stretch of undulating country which\r\nbelonged to them. They rambled round the square roofs of the pavilions,\r\nfollowed the course of the long roofs of the covered ways, climbed and\r\ndescended the slopes, and lost themselves in endless perambulations of\r\ndiscovery. And when they grew tired of the lower levels they ascended\r\nstill higher, venturing up the iron ladders, on which Cadine\u2019s skirts\r\nflapped like flags. Then they ran along the second tier of roofs\r\nbeneath the open heavens. There was nothing save the stars above them.\r\nAll sorts of sounds rose up from the echoing markets, a clattering and\r\nrumbling, a vague roar as of a distant tempest heard at nighttime. At\r\nthat height the morning breeze swept away the evil smells, the foul\r\nbreath of the awaking markets. They would kiss one another on the edge\r\nof the gutterings like sparrows frisking on the house-tops. The rising\r\nfires of the sun illumined their faces with a ruddy glow. Cadine\r\nlaughed with pleasure at being so high up in the air, and her neck\r\nshone with iridescent tints like a dove\u2019s; while Marjolin bent down to\r\nlook at the street still wrapped in gloom, with his hands clutching\r\nhold of the leads like the feet of a wood-pigeon. When they descended\r\nto earth again, joyful from their excursion in the fresh air, they\r\nwould remark to one another that they were coming back from the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt was in the tripe market that they had made the acquaintance of\r\nClaude Lantier. They went there every day, impelled thereto by an\r\nanimal taste for blood, the cruel instinct of urchins who find\r\namusement in the sight of severed heads. A ruddy stream flowed along\r\nthe gutters round the pavilion; they dipped the tips of their shoes in\r\nit, and dammed it up with leaves, so as to form large pools of blood.\r\nThey took a strong interest in the arrival of the loads of offal in\r\ncarts which always smelt offensively, despite all the drenchings of\r\nwater they got; they watched the unloading of the bundles of sheep\u2019s\r\ntrotters, which were piled up on the ground like filthy paving-stones,\r\nof the huge stiffened tongues, bleeding at their torn roots, and of the\r\nmassive bell-shaped bullocks\u2019 hearts. But the spectacle which, above\r\nall others, made them quiver with delight was that of the big dripping\r\nhampers, full of sheep\u2019s heads, with greasy horns and black muzzles,\r\nand strips of woolly skin dangling from bleeding flesh. The sight of\r\nthese conjured up in their minds the idea of some guillotine casting\r\ninto the baskets the heads of countless victims.\r\n\r\nThey followed the baskets into the depths of the cellar, watching them\r\nglide down the rails laid over the steps, and listening to the rasping\r\nnoise which the casters of these osier waggons made in their descent.\r\nDown below there was a scene of exquisite horror. They entered into a\r\ncharnel-house atmosphere, and walked along through murky puddles,\r\namidst which every now and then purple eyes seem to be glistening. At\r\ntimes the soles of their boots stuck to the ground, at others they\r\nsplashed through the horrible mire, anxious and yet delighted. The gas\r\njets burned low, like blinking, bloodshot eyes. Near the water-taps, in\r\nthe pale light falling through the gratings, they came upon the blocks;\r\nand there they remained in rapture watching the tripe men, who, in\r\naprons stiffened by gory splashings, broke the sheep\u2019s heads one after\r\nanother with a blow of their mallets. They lingered there for hours,\r\nwaiting till all the baskets were empty, fascinated by the crackling of\r\nthe bones, unable to tear themselves away till all was over. Sometimes\r\nan attendant passed behind them, cleansing the cellar with a hose;\r\nfloods of water rushed out with a sluice-like roar, but although the\r\nviolence of the discharge actually ate away the surface of the\r\nflagstones, it was powerless to remove the ruddy stains and stench of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nCadine and Marjolin were sure of meeting Claude between four and five\r\nin the afternoon at the wholesale auction of the bullocks\u2019 lights. He\r\nwas always there amidst the tripe dealers\u2019 carts backed up against the\r\nkerb-stones and the blue-bloused, white-aproned men who jostled him and\r\ndeafened his ears by their loud bids. But he never felt their elbows;\r\nhe stood in a sort of ecstatic trance before the huge hanging lights,\r\nand often told Cadine and Marjolin that there was no finer sight to be\r\nseen. The lights were of a soft rosy hue, gradually deepening and\r\nturning at the lower edges to a rich carmine; and Claude compared them\r\nto watered satin, finding no other term to describe the soft silkiness\r\nof those flowing lengths of flesh which drooped in broad folds like\r\nballet dancers\u2019 skirts. He thought, too, of gauze and lace allowing a\r\nglimpse of pinky skin; and when a ray of sunshine fell upon the lights\r\nand girdled them with gold an expression of languorous rapture came\r\ninto his eyes, and he felt happier than if he had been privileged to\r\ncontemplate the Greek goddesses in their sovereign nudity, or the\r\nchatelaines of romance in their brocaded robes.\r\n\r\nThe artist became a great friend of the two young scapegraces. He loved\r\nbeautiful animals, and such undoubtedly they were. For a long time he\r\ndreamt of a colossal picture which should represent the loves of Cadine\r\nand Marjolin in the central markets, amidst the vegetables, the fish,\r\nand the meat. He would have depicted them seated on some couch of food,\r\ntheir arms circling each other\u2019s waists, and their lips exchanging an\r\nidyllic kiss. In this conception he saw a manifesto proclaiming the\r\npositivism of art\u2014modern art, experimental and materialistic. And it\r\nseemed to him also that it would be a smart satire on the school which\r\nwishes every painting to embody an \u201Cidea,\u201D a slap for the old\r\ntraditions and all they represented. But during a couple of years he\r\nbegan study after study without succeeding in giving the particular\r\n\u201Cnote\u201D he desired. In this way he spoilt fifteen canvases. His failure\r\nfilled him with rancour; however, he continued to associate with his\r\ntwo models from a sort of hopeless love for his abortive picture. When\r\nhe met them prowling about in the afternoon, he often scoured the\r\nneighbourhood with them, strolling around with his hands in his\r\npockets, and deeply interested in the life of the streets.\r\n\r\nThey all three trudged along together, dragging their heels over the\r\nfootways and monopolising their whole breadth so as to force others to\r\nstep down into the road. With their noses in the air they sniffed in\r\nthe odours of Paris, and could have recognised every corner blindfold\r\nby the spirituous emanations of the wine shops, the hot puffs that came\r\nfrom the bakehouses and confectioners\u2019, and the musty odours wafted\r\nfrom the fruiterers\u2019. They would make the circuit of the whole\r\ndistrict. They delighted in passing through the rotunda of the corn\r\nmarket, that huge massive stone cage where sacks of flour were piled up\r\non every side, and where their footsteps echoed in the silence of the\r\nresonant roof. They were fond, too, of the little narrow streets in the\r\nneighbourhood, which had become as deserted, as black, and as mournful\r\nas though they formed part of an abandoned city. These were the Rue\r\nBabille, the Rue Sauval, the Rue des Deux Ecus, and the Rue de Viarmes,\r\nthis last pallid from its proximity to the millers\u2019 stores, and at four\r\no\u2019clock lively by reason of the corn exchange held there. It was\r\ngenerally at this point that they started on their round. They made\r\ntheir way slowly along the Rue Vauvilliers, glancing as they went at\r\nthe windows of the low eating-houses, and thus reaching the miserably\r\nnarrow Rue des Prouvaires, where Claude blinked his eyes as he saw one\r\nof the covered ways of the market, at the far end of which, framed\r\nround by this huge iron nave, appeared a side entrance of St. Eustache\r\nwith its rose and its tiers of arched windows. And then, with an air of\r\ndefiance, he would remark that all the middle ages and the Renaissance\r\nput together were less mighty than the central markets. Afterwards, as\r\nthey paced the broad new streets, the Rue du Pont Neuf and the Rue des\r\nHalles, he explained modern life with its wide footways, its lofty\r\nhouses, and its luxurious shops, to the two urchins. He predicted, too,\r\nthe advent of new and truly original art, whose approach he could\r\ndivine, and despair filled him that its revelation should seemingly be\r\nbeyond his own powers.\r\n\r\nCadine and Marjolin, however, preferred the provincial quietness of the\r\nRue des Bourdonnais, where one can play at marbles without fear of\r\nbeing run over. The girl perked her head affectedly as she passed the\r\nwholesale glove and hosiery stores, at each door of which bareheaded\r\nassistants, with their pens stuck in their ears, stood watching her\r\nwith a weary gaze. And she and her lover had yet a stronger preference\r\nfor such bits of olden Paris as still existed: the Rue de la Poterie\r\nand the Rue de la Lingerie, with their butter and egg and cheese\r\ndealers; the Rue de la Ferronerie and the Rue de l\u2019Aiguillerie (the\r\nbeautiful streets of far-away times), with their dark narrow shops; and\r\nespecially the Rue Courtalon, a dank, dirty by-way running from the\r\nPlace Sainte Opportune to the Rue Saint Denis, and intersected by\r\nfoul-smelling alleys where they had romped in their younger days. In\r\nthe Rue Saint Denis they entered into the land of dainties; and they\r\nsmiled upon the dried apples, the \u201CSpanishwood,\u201D the prunes, and the\r\nsugar-candy in the windows of the grocers and druggists. Their\r\nramblings always set them dreaming of a feast of good things, and\r\ninspired them with a desire to glut themselves on the contents of the\r\nwindows. To them the district seemed like some huge table, always laid\r\nwith an everlasting dessert into which they longed to plunge their\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nThey devoted but a moment to visiting the other blocks of tumble-down\r\nold houses, the Rue Pirouette, the Rue de Mondetour, the Rue de la\r\nPetite Truanderie, and the Rue de la Grande Truanderie, for they took\r\nlittle interest in the shops of the dealers in edible snails, cooked\r\nvegetables, tripe, and drink. In the Rue de la Grand Truanderie,\r\nhowever, there was a soap factory, an oasis of sweetness in the midst\r\nof all the foul odours, and Marjolin was fond of standing outside it\r\ntill some one happened to enter or come out, so that the perfume which\r\nswept through the doorway might blow full in his face. Then with all\r\nspeed they returned to the Rue Pierre Lescot and the Rue Rambuteau.\r\nCadine was extremely fond of salted provisions; she stood in admiration\r\nbefore the bundles of red-herrings, the barrels of anchovies and\r\ncapers, and the little casks of gherkins and olives, standing on end\r\nwith wooden spoons inside them. The smell of the vinegar titillated her\r\nthroat; the pungent odour of the rolled cod, smoked salmon, bacon and\r\nham, and the sharp acidity of the baskets of lemons, made her mouth\r\nwater longingly. She was also fond of feasting her eyes on the boxes of\r\nsardines piled up in metallic columns amidst the cases and sacks. In\r\nthe Rue Montorgueil and the Rue Montmartre were other tempting-looking\r\ngroceries and restaurants, from whose basements appetising odours were\r\nwafted, with glorious shows of game and poultry, and\r\npreserved-provision shops, which last displayed beside their doors open\r\nkegs overflowing with yellow sour-krout suggestive of old lacework.\r\nThen they lingered in the Rue Coquilli\u00E8re, inhaling the odour of\r\ntruffles from the premises of a notable dealer in comestibles, which\r\nthrew so strong a perfume into the street that Cadine and Marjolin\r\nclosed their eyes and imagined they were swallowing all kinds of\r\ndelicious things. These perfumes, however, distressed Claude. They made\r\nhim realise the emptiness of his stomach, he said; and, leaving the\r\n\u201Ctwo animals\u201D to feast on the odour of the truffles\u2014the most\r\npenetrating odour to be found in all the neighbourhood\u2014he went off\r\nagain to the corn market by way of the Rue Oblin, studying on his road\r\nthe old women who sold green-stuff in the doorways and the displays of\r\ncheap pottery spread out on the foot-pavements.\r\n\r\nSuch were their rambles in common; but when Cadine set out alone with\r\nher bunches of violets she often went farther afield, making it a point\r\nto visit certain shops for which she had a particular partiality. She\r\nhad an especial weakness for the Taboureau bakery establishment, one of\r\nthe windows of which was exclusively devoted to pastry. She would\r\nfollow the Rue Turbigo and retrace her steps a dozen times in order to\r\npass again and again before the almond cakes, the _savarins_, the St.\r\nHonor\u00E9 tarts, the fruit tarts, and the various dishes containing\r\nbunlike _babas_ redolent of rum, eclairs combining the finger biscuit\r\nwith chocolate, and _choux a la cr\u00E8me_, little rounds of pastry\r\noverflowing with whipped white of egg. The glass jars full of dry\r\nbiscuits, macaroons, and _madeleines_ also made her mouth water; and\r\nthe bright shop with its big mirrors, its marble slabs, its gilding,\r\nits bread-bins of ornamental ironwork, and its second window in which\r\nlong glistening loaves were displayed slantwise, with one end resting\r\non a crystal shelf whilst above they were upheld by a brass rod, was so\r\nwarm and odoriferous of baked dough that her features expanded with\r\npleasure when, yielding to temptation, she went in to buy a _brioche_\r\nfor two sous.\r\n\r\nAnother shop, one in front of the Square des Innocents, also filled her\r\nwith gluttonous inquisitiveness, a fever of longing desire. This shop\r\nmade a specialty of forcemeat pasties. In addition to the ordinary ones\r\nthere were pasties of pike and pasties of truffled _foie gras_; and the\r\ngirl would gaze yearningly at them, saying to herself that she would\r\nreally have to eat one some day.\r\n\r\nCadine also had her moments of vanity and coquetry. When these fits\r\nwere on her, she bought herself in imagination some of the magnificent\r\ndresses displayed in the windows of the \u201CFabriques de France\u201D which\r\nmade the Pointe Saint Eustache gaudy with their pieces of bright stuff\r\nhanging from the first floor to the footway and flapping in the breeze.\r\nSomewhat incommoded by the flat basket hanging before her, amidst the\r\ncrowd of market women in dirty aprons gazing at future Sunday dresses,\r\nthe girl would feel the woollens, flannels, and cottons to test the\r\ntexture and suppleness of the material; and she would promise herself a\r\ngown of bright-coloured flannelling, flowered print, or scarlet poplin.\r\nSometimes even from amongst the pieces draped and set off to advantage\r\nby the window-dressers she would choose some soft sky-blue or\r\napple-green silk, and dream of wearing it with pink ribbons. In the\r\nevenings she would dazzle herself with the displays in the windows of\r\nthe big jewellers in the Rue Montmartre. That terrible street deafened\r\nher with its ceaseless flow of vehicles, and the streaming crowd never\r\nceased to jostle her; still she did not stir, but remained feasting her\r\neyes on the blazing splendour set out in the light of the reflecting\r\nlamps which hung outside the windows. On one side all was white with\r\nthe bright glitter of silver: watches in rows, chains hanging, spoons\r\nand forks laid crossways, cups, snuff-boxes, napkin-rings, and combs\r\narranged on shelves. The silver thimbles, dotting a porcelain stand\r\ncovered with a glass shade, had an especial attraction for her. Then on\r\nthe other side the windows glistened with the tawny glow of gold. A\r\ncascade of long pendant chains descended from above, rippling with\r\nruddy gleams; small ladies\u2019 watches, with the backs of their cases\r\ndisplayed, sparkled like fallen stars; wedding rings clustered round\r\nslender rods; bracelets, broaches, and other costly ornaments glittered\r\non the black velvet linings of their cases; jewelled rings set their\r\nstands aglow with blue, green, yellow, and violet flamelets; while on\r\nevery tier of the shelves superposed rows of earrings and crosses and\r\nlockets hung against the crystal like the rich fringes of altar-cloths.\r\nThe glow of this gold illumined the street half way across with a\r\nsun-like radiance. And Cadine, as she gazed at it, almost fancied that\r\nshe was in presence of something holy, or on the threshold of the\r\nEmperor\u2019s treasure chamber. She would for a long time scrutinise all\r\nthis show of gaudy jewellery, adapted to the taste of the fish-wives,\r\nand carefully read the large figures on the tickets affixed to each\r\narticle; and eventually she would select for herself a pair of\r\nearrings\u2014pear-shaped drops of imitation coral hanging from golden\r\nroses.\r\n\r\nOne morning Claude caught her standing in ecstasy before a\r\nhair-dresser\u2019s window in the Rue Saint Honor\u00E9. She was gazing at the\r\ndisplay of hair with an expression of intense envy. High up in the\r\nwindow was a streaming cascade of long manes, soft wisps, loose\r\ntresses, frizzy falls, undulating comb-curls, a perfect cataract of\r\nsilky and bristling hair, real and artificial, now in coils of a\r\nflaming red, now in thick black crops, now in pale golden locks, and\r\neven in snowy white ones for the coquette of sixty. In cardboard boxes\r\ndown below were cleverly arranged fringes, curling side-ringlets, and\r\ncarefully combed chignons glossy with pomade. And amidst this\r\nframework, in a sort of shrine beneath the ravelled ends of the hanging\r\nlocks, there revolved the bust of a woman, arrayed in a wrapper of\r\ncherry-coloured satin fastened between the breasts with a brass brooch.\r\nThe figure wore a lofty bridal coiffure picked out with sprigs of\r\norange blossom, and smiled with a dollish smile. Its eyes were pale\r\nblue; its eyebrows were very stiff and of exaggerated length; and its\r\nwaxen cheeks and shoulders bore evident traces of the heat and smoke of\r\nthe gas. Cadine waited till the revolving figure again displayed its\r\nsmiling face, and as its profile showed more distinctly and it slowly\r\nwent round from left to right she felt perfectly happy. Claude,\r\nhowever, was indignant, and, shaking Cadine, he asked her what she was\r\ndoing in front of \u201Cthat abomination, that corpse-like hussy picked up\r\nat the Morgue!\u201D He flew into a temper with the \u201Cdummy\u2019s\u201D cadaverous\r\nface and shoulders, that disfigurement of the beautiful, and remarked\r\nthat artists painted nothing but that unreal type of woman nowadays.\r\nCadine, however, remained unconvinced by his oratory, and considered\r\nthe lady extremely beautiful. Then, resisting the attempts of the\r\nartist to drag her away by the arm, and scratching her black mop in\r\nvexation, she pointed to an enormous ruddy tail, severed from the\r\nquarters of some vigorous mare, and told him she would have liked to\r\nhave a crop of hair like that.\r\n\r\nDuring the long rambles when Claude, Cadine, and Marjolin prowled about\r\nthe neighbourhood of the markets, they saw the iron ribs of the giant\r\nbuilding at the end of every street. Wherever they turned they caught\r\nsudden glimpses of it; the horizon was always bounded by it; merely the\r\naspect under which it was seen varied. Claude was perpetually turning\r\nround, and particularly in the Rue Montmartre, after passing the\r\nchurch. From that point the markets, seen obliquely in the distance,\r\nfilled him with enthusiasm. A huge arcade, a giant, gaping gateway, was\r\nopen before him; then came the crowding pavilions with their lower and\r\nupper roofs, their countless Venetian shutters and endless blinds, a\r\nvision, as it were, of superposed houses and palaces; a Babylon of\r\nmetal of Hindoo delicacy of workmanship, intersected by hanging\r\nterraces, aerial galleries, and flying bridges poised over space. The\r\ntrio always returned to this city round which they strolled, unable to\r\nstray more than a hundred yards away. They came back to it during the\r\nhot afternoons when the Venetian shutters were closed and the blinds\r\nlowered. In the covered ways all seemed to be asleep, the ashy greyness\r\nwas streaked by yellow bars of sunlight falling through the high\r\nwindows. Only a subdued murmur broke the silence; the steps of a few\r\nhurrying passers-by resounded on the footways; whilst the badge-wearing\r\nporters sat in rows on the stone ledges at the corners of the\r\npavilions, taking off their boots and nursing their aching feet. The\r\nquietude was that of a colossus at rest, interrupted at times by some\r\ncock-crow rising from the cellars below.\r\n\r\nClaude, Cadine, and Marjolin then often went to see the empty hampers\r\npiled upon the drays, which came to fetch them every afternoon so that\r\nthey might be sent back to the consignors. There were mountains of\r\nthem, labelled with black letters and figures, in front of the\r\nsalesmen\u2019s warehouses in the Rue Berger. The porters arranged them\r\nsymmetrically, tier by tier, on the vehicles. When the pile rose,\r\nhowever, to the height of a first floor, the porter who stood below\r\nbalancing the next batch of hampers had to make a spring in order to\r\ntoss them up to his mate, who was perched aloft with arms extended.\r\nClaude, who delighted in feats of strength and dexterity, would stand\r\nfor hours watching the flight of these masses of osier, and would burst\r\ninto a hearty laugh whenever too vigorous a toss sent them flying over\r\nthe pile into the roadway beyond. He was fond, too, of the footways of\r\nthe Rue Rambuteau and the Rue du Pont Neuf, near the fruit market,\r\nwhere the retail dealers congregated. The sight of the vegetables\r\ndisplayed in the open air, on trestle-tables covered with damp black\r\nrags, was full of charm for him. At four in the afternoon the whole of\r\nthis nook of greenery was aglow with sunshine; and Claude wandered\r\nbetween the stalls, inspecting the bright-coloured heads of the\r\nsaleswomen with keen artistic relish. The younger ones, with their hair\r\nin nets, had already lost all freshness of complexion through the rough\r\nlife they led; while the older ones were bent and shrivelled, with\r\nwrinkled, flaring faces showing under the yellow kerchiefs bound round\r\ntheir heads. Cadine and Marjolin refused to accompany him hither, as\r\nthey could perceive old Mother Chantemesse shaking her fist at them, in\r\nher anger at seeing them prowling about together. He joined them again,\r\nhowever, on the opposite footway, where he found a splendid subject for\r\na picture in the stallkeepers squatting under their huge umbrellas of\r\nfaded red, blue, and violet, which, mounted upon poles, filled the\r\nwhole market-side with bumps, and showed conspicuously against the\r\nfiery glow of the sinking sun, whose rays faded amidst the carrots and\r\nthe turnips. One tattered harridan, a century old, was sheltering three\r\nspare-looking lettuces beneath an umbrella of pink silk, shockingly\r\nsplit and stained.\r\n\r\nCadine and Marjolin had struck up an acquaintance with Leon, Quenu\u2019s\r\napprentice, one day when he was taking a pie to a house in the\r\nneighbourhood. They saw him cautiously raise the lid of his pan in a\r\nsecluded corner of the Rue de Mondetour, and delicately take out a ball\r\nof forcemeat. They smiled at the sight, which gave them a very high\r\nopinion of Leon. And the idea came to Cadine that she might at last\r\nsatisfy one of her most ardent longings. Indeed, the very next time\r\nthat she met the lad with his basket she made herself very agreeable,\r\nand induced him to offer her a forcemeat ball. But, although she\r\nlaughed and licked her fingers, she experienced some disappointment.\r\nThe forcemeat did not prove nearly so nice as she had anticipated. On\r\nthe other hand, the lad, with his sly, greedy phiz and his white\r\ngarments, which made him look like a girl going to her first communion,\r\nsomewhat took her fancy.\r\n\r\nShe invited him to a monster lunch which she gave amongst the hampers\r\nin the auction room at the butter market. The three of them\u2014herself,\r\nMarjolin, and Leon\u2014completely secluded themselves from the world within\r\nfour walls of osier. The feast was laid out on a large flat basket.\r\nThere were pears, nuts, cream-cheese, shrimps, fried potatoes, and\r\nradishes. The cheese came from a fruiterer\u2019s in the Rue de la\r\nCossonnerie, and was a present; and a \u201Cfrier\u201D of the Rue de la Grande\r\nTruanderie had given Cadine credit for two sous\u2019 worth of potatoes. The\r\nrest of the feast, the pears, the nuts, the shrimps, and the radishes,\r\nhad been pilfered from different parts of the market. It was a\r\ndelicious treat; and Leon, desirous of returning the hospitality, gave\r\na supper in his bedroom at one o\u2019clock in the morning. The bill of fare\r\nincluded cold black-pudding, slices of polony, a piece of salt pork,\r\nsome gherkins, and some goose-fat. The Quenu-Gradelles\u2019 shop had\r\nprovided everything. And matters did not stop there. Dainty suppers\r\nalternated with delicate luncheons, and invitation upon invitation.\r\nThree times a week there were banquets, either amidst the hampers or in\r\nLeon\u2019s garret, where Florent, on the nights when he lay awake, could\r\nhear a stifled sound of munching and rippling laughter until day began\r\nto break.\r\n\r\nThe loves of Cadine and Marjolin now took another turn. The youth\r\nplayed the gallant, and just as another might entertain his\r\n_innamorata_ at a champagne supper _en t\u00EAte \u00E0 t\u00EAte_ in a private room,\r\nhe led Cadine into some quiet corner of the market cellars to munch\r\napples or sprigs of celery. One day he stole a red-herring, which they\r\ndevoured with immense enjoyment on the roof of the fish market beside\r\nthe guttering. There was not a single shady nook in the whole place\r\nwhere they did not indulge in secret feasts. The district, with its\r\nrows of open shops full of fruit and cakes and preserves, was no longer\r\na closed paradise, in front of which they prowled with greedy, covetous\r\nappetites. As they passed the shops they now extended their hands and\r\npilfered a prune, a few cherries, or a bit of cod. They also\r\nprovisioned themselves at the markets, keeping a sharp look-out as they\r\nmade their way between the stalls, picking up everything that fell, and\r\noften assisting the fall by a push of their shoulders.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of all the marauding, some terrible scores had to be\r\nrun up with the \u201Cfrier\u201D of the Rue de la Grand Truanderie. This\r\n\u201Cfrier,\u201D whose shanty leaned against a tumble-down house, and was\r\npropped up by heavy joists, green with moss, made a display of boiled\r\nmussels lying in large earthenware bowls filled to the brim with clear\r\nwater; of dishes of little yellow dabs stiffened by too thick a coating\r\nof paste; of squares of tripe simmering in a pan; and of grilled\r\nherrings, black and charred, and so hard that if you tapped them they\r\nsounded like wood. On certain weeks Cadine owed the frier as much as\r\ntwenty sous, a crushing debt, which required the sale of an\r\nincalculable number of bunches of violets, for she could count upon no\r\nassistance from Marjolin. Moreover, she was bound to return Leon\u2019s\r\nhospitalities; and she even felt some little shame at never being able\r\nto offer him a scrap of meat. He himself had now taken to purloining\r\nentire hams. As a rule, he stowed everything away under his shirt; and\r\nat night when he reached his bedroom he drew from his bosom hunks of\r\npolony, slices of _pat\u00E9 de foie gras_, and bundles of pork rind. They\r\nhad to do without bread, and there was nothing to drink; but no matter.\r\nOne night Marjolin saw Leon kiss Cadine between two mouthfuls; however,\r\nhe only laughed. He could have smashed the little fellow with a blow\r\nfrom his fist, but he felt no jealousy in respect of Cadine. He treated\r\nher simply as a comrade with whom he had chummed for years.\r\n\r\nClaude never participated in these feasts. Having caught Cadine one day\r\nstealing a beet-root from a little hamper lined with hay, he had pulled\r\nher ears and given her a sound rating. These thieving propensities made\r\nher perfect as a ne\u2019er-do-well. However, in spite of himself, he could\r\nnot help feeling a sort of admiration for these sensual, pilfering,\r\ngreedy creatures, who preyed upon everything that lay about, feasting\r\noff the crumbs that fell from the giant\u2019s table.\r\n\r\nAt last Marjolin nominally took service under Gavard, happy in having\r\nnothing to do except to listen to his master\u2019s flow of talk, while\r\nCadine still continued to sell violets, quite accustomed by this time\r\nto old Mother Chantemesse\u2019s scoldings. They were still the same\r\nchildren as ever, giving way to their instincts and appetites without\r\nthe slightest shame\u2014they were the growth of the slimy pavements of the\r\nmarket district, where, even in fine weather, the mud remains black and\r\nsticky. However, as Cadine walked along the footways, mechanically\r\ntwisting her bunches of violets, she was sometimes disturbed by\r\ndisquieting reveries; and Marjolin, too, suffered from an uneasiness\r\nwhich he could not explain. He would occasionally leave the girl and\r\nmiss some ramble or feast in order to go and gaze at Madame Quenu\r\nthrough the windows of her pork shop. She was so handsome and plump and\r\nround that it did him good to look at her. As he stood gazing at her,\r\nhe felt full and satisfied, as though he had just eaten or drunk\r\nsomething extremely nice. And when he went off, a sort of hunger and\r\nthirst to see her again suddenly came upon him. This had been going on\r\nfor a couple of months. At first he had looked at her with the\r\nrespectful glance which he bestowed upon the shop-fronts of the grocers\r\nand provision dealers; but subsequently, when he and Cadine had taken\r\nto general pilfering, he began to regard her smooth cheeks much as he\r\nregarded the barrels of olives and boxes of dried apples.\r\n\r\nFor some time past Marjolin had seen handsome Lisa every day, in the\r\nmorning. She would pass Gavard\u2019s stall, and stop for a moment or two to\r\nchat with the poultry dealer. She now did her marketing herself, so\r\nthat she might be cheated as little as possible, she said. The truth,\r\nhowever, was that she wished to make Gavard speak out. In the pork shop\r\nhe was always distrustful, but at his stall he chatted and talked with\r\nthe utmost freedom. Now, Lisa had made up her mind to ascertain from\r\nhim exactly what took place in the little room at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s;\r\nfor she had no great confidence in her secret police office,\r\nMademoiselle Saget. In a short time she learnt from the incorrigible\r\nchatterbox a lot of vague details which very much alarmed her. Two days\r\nafter her explanation with Quenu she returned home from the market\r\nlooking very pale. She beckoned to her husband to follow her into the\r\ndining-room, and having carefully closed the door she said to him: \u201CIs\r\nyour brother determined to send us to the scaffold, then? Why did you\r\nconceal from me what you knew?\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu declared that he knew nothing. He even swore a great oath that he\r\nhad not returned to Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, and would never go there again.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou will do well not to do so,\u201D replied Lisa, shrugging her shoulders,\r\n\u201Cunless you want to get yourself into a serious scrape. Florent is up\r\nto some evil trick, I\u2019m certain of it! I have just learned quite\r\nsufficient to show me where he is going. He\u2019s going back to Cayenne, do\r\nyou hear?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, after a pause, she continued in calmer ones: \u201COh, the unhappy\r\nman! He had everything here that he could wish for. He might have\r\nredeemed his character; he had nothing but good examples before him.\r\nBut no, it is in his blood! He will come to a violent end with his\r\npolitics! I insist upon there being an end to all this! You hear me,\r\nQuenu? I gave you due warning long ago!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe spoke the last words very incisively. Quenu bent his head, as if\r\nawaiting sentence.\r\n\r\n\u201CTo begin with,\u201D continued Lisa, \u201Che shall cease to take his meals\r\nhere. It will be quite sufficient if we give him a bed. He is earning\r\nmoney; let him feed himself.\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu seemed on the point of protesting, but his wife silenced him by\r\nadding energetically:\r\n\r\n\u201CMake your choice between him and me. If he remains here, I swear to\r\nyou that I will go away, and take my daughter with me. Do you want me\r\nto tell you the whole truth about him? He is a man capable of anything;\r\nhe has come here to bring discord into our household. But I will set\r\nthings right, you may depend on it. You have your choice between him\r\nand me; you hear me?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, leaving her husband in silent consternation, she returned to the\r\nshop, where she served a customer with her usual affable smile. The\r\nfact was that, having artfully inveigled Gavard into a political\r\ndiscussion, the poultry dealer had told her that she would soon see how\r\nthe land lay, that they were going to make a clean sweep of everything,\r\nand that two determined men like her brother-in-law and himself would\r\nsuffice to set the fire blazing. This was the evil trick of which she\r\nhad spoken to Quenu, some conspiracy to which Gavard was always making\r\nmysterious allusions with a sniggering grin from which he seemingly\r\ndesired a great deal to be inferred. And in imagination Lisa already\r\nsaw the gendarmes invading the pork shop, gagging herself, her husband,\r\nand Pauline, and casting them into some underground dungeon.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, at dinner, she evinced an icy frigidity. She made no\r\noffers to serve Florent, but several times remarked: \u201CIt\u2019s very strange\r\nwhat an amount of bread we\u2019ve got through lately.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent at last understood. He felt that he was being treated like a\r\npoor relation who is gradually turned out of doors. For the last two\r\nmonths Lisa had dressed him in Quenu\u2019s old trousers and coats; and, as\r\nhe was as thin as his brother was fat, these ragged garments had a most\r\nextraordinary appearance upon him. She also turned her oldest linen\r\nover to him: pocket-handkerchiefs which had been darned a score of\r\ntimes, ragged towels, sheets which were only fit to be cut up into\r\ndusters and dish-cloths, and worn-out shirts, distended by Quenu\u2019s\r\ncorpulent figure, and so short that they would have served Florent as\r\nunder-vests. Moreover, he no longer found around him the same\r\ngood-natured kindliness as in the earlier days. The whole household\r\nseemed to shrug its shoulders after the example set by handsome Lisa.\r\nAuguste and Augustine turned their backs upon him, and little Pauline,\r\nwith the cruel frankness of childhood, let fall some bitter remarks\r\nabout the stains on his coat and the holes in his shirt. However,\r\nduring the last days he suffered most at table. He scarcely dared to\r\neat, as he saw the mother and daughter fix their gaze upon him whenever\r\nhe cut himself a piece of bread. Quenu meantime peered into his plate,\r\nto avoid having to take any part in what went on.\r\n\r\nThat which most tortured Florent was his inability to invent a reason\r\nfor leaving the house. During a week he kept on revolving in his mind a\r\nsentence expressing his resolve to take his meals elsewhere, but could\r\nnot bring himself to utter it. Indeed, this man of tender nature lived\r\nin such a world of illusions that he feared he might hurt his brother\r\nand sister-in-law by ceasing to lunch and dine with them. It had taken\r\nhim over two months to detect Lisa\u2019s latent hostility; and even now he\r\nwas sometimes inclined to think that he must be mistaken, and that she\r\nwas in reality kindly disposed towards him. Unselfishness with him\r\nextended to forgetfulness of his requirements; it was no longer a\r\nvirtue, but utter indifference to self, an absolute obliteration of\r\npersonality. Even when he recognised that he was being gradually turned\r\nout of the house, his mind never for a moment dwelt upon his share in\r\nold Gradelle\u2019s fortune, or upon the accounts which Lisa had offered\r\nhim. He had already planned out his expenditure for the future;\r\nreckoning that with what Madame Verlaque still allowed him to retain of\r\nhis salary, and the thirty francs a month which a pupil, obtained\r\nthrough La Normande, paid him he would be able to spend eighteen sous\r\non his breakfast and twenty-six sous on his dinner. This, he thought,\r\nwould be ample. And so, at last, taking as his excuse the lessons which\r\nhe was giving his new pupil, he emboldened himself one morning to\r\npretend that it would be impossible for him in future to come to the\r\nhouse at mealtimes. He blushed as he gave utterance to this laboriously\r\nconstructed lie, which had given him so much trouble, and continued\r\napologetically:\r\n\r\n\u201CYou mustn\u2019t be offended; the boy only has those hours free. I can\r\neasily get something to eat, you know; and I will come and have a chat\r\nwith you in the evenings.\u201D\r\n\r\nBeautiful Lisa maintained her icy reserve, and this increased Florent\u2019s\r\nfeeling of trouble. In order to have no cause for self-reproach she had\r\nbeen unwilling to send him about his business, preferring to wait till\r\nhe should weary of the situation and go of his own accord. Now he was\r\ngoing, and it was a good riddance; and she studiously refrained from\r\nall show of kindliness for fear it might induce him to remain. Quenu,\r\nhowever, showed some signs of emotion, and exclaimed: \u201CDon\u2019t think of\r\nputting yourself about; take your meals elsewhere by all means, if it\r\nis more convenient. It isn\u2019t we who are turning you way; you\u2019ll at all\r\nevents dine with us sometimes on Sundays, eh?\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent hurried off. His heart was very heavy. When he had gone, the\r\nbeautiful Lisa did not venture to reproach her husband for his weakness\r\nin giving that invitation for Sundays. She had conquered, and again\r\nbreathed freely amongst the light oak of her dining-room, where she\r\nwould have liked to burn some sugar to drive away the odour of perverse\r\nleanness which seemed to linger about. Moreover, she continued to\r\nremain on the defensive; and at the end of another week she felt more\r\nalarmed than ever. She only occasionally saw Florent in the evenings,\r\nand began to have all sorts of dreadful thoughts, imagining that her\r\nbrother-in-law was constructing some infernal machine upstairs in\r\nAugustine\u2019s bedroom, or else making signals which would result in\r\nbarricades covering the whole neighbourhood. Gavard, who had become\r\ngloomy, merely nodded or shook his head when she spoke to him, and left\r\nhis stall for days together in Marjolin\u2019s charge. The beautiful Lisa,\r\nhowever, determined that she would get to the bottom of affairs. She\r\nknew that Florent had obtained a day\u2019s leave, and intended to spend it\r\nwith Claude Lantier, at Madame Francois\u2019s, at Nanterre. As he would\r\nstart in the morning, and remain away till night, she conceived the\r\nidea of inviting Gavard to dinner. He would be sure to talk freely, at\r\ntable, she thought. But throughout the morning she was unable to meet\r\nthe poultry dealer, and so in the afternoon she went back again to the\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nMarjolin was in the stall alone. He used to drowse there for hours,\r\nrecouping himself from the fatigue of his long rambles. He generally\r\nsat upon one chair with his legs resting upon another, and his head\r\nleaning against a little dresser. In the wintertime he took a keen\r\ndelight in lolling there and contemplating the display of game; the\r\nbucks hanging head downwards, with their fore-legs broken and twisted\r\nround their necks; the larks festooning the stall like garlands; the\r\nbig ruddy hares, the mottled partridges, the water-fowl of a\r\nbronze-grey hue, the Russian black cocks and hazel hens, which arrived\r\nin a packing of oat straw and charcoal;[*] and the pheasants, the\r\nmagnificent pheasants, with their scarlet hoods, their stomachers of\r\ngreen satin, their mantles of embossed gold, and their flaming tails,\r\nthat trailed like trains of court robes. All this show of plumage\r\nreminded Marjolin of his rambles in the cellars with Cadine amongst the\r\nhampers of feathers.\r\n\r\n[*] The baskets in which these are sent to Paris are identical with\r\nthose which in many provinces of Russia serve the _moujiks_ as cradles\r\nfor their infants.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the beautiful Lisa found Marjolin in the midst of the\r\npoultry. It was warm, and whiffs of hot air passed along the narrow\r\nalleys of the pavilion. She was obliged to stoop before she could see\r\nhim stretched out inside the stall, below the bare flesh of the birds.\r\nFrom the hooked bar up above hung fat geese, the hooks sticking in the\r\nbleeding wounds of their long stiffened necks, while their huge bodies\r\nbulged out, glowing ruddily beneath their fine down, and, with their\r\nsnowy tails and wings, suggesting nudity encompassed by fine linen. And\r\nalso hanging from the bar, with ears thrown back and feet parted as\r\nthough they were bent on some vigorous leap, were grey rabbits whose\r\nturned-up tails gleamed whitely, whilst their heads, with sharp teeth\r\nand dim eyes, laughed with the grin of death. On the counter of the\r\nstall plucked fowls showed their strained fleshy breasts; pigeons,\r\ncrowded on osier trays, displayed the soft bare skin of innocents;\r\nducks, with skin of rougher texture, exhibited their webbed feet; and\r\nthree magnificent turkeys, speckled with blue dots, like freshly-shaven\r\nchins, slumbered on their backs amidst the black fans of their expanded\r\ntails. On plates near by were giblets, livers, gizzards, necks, feet,\r\nand wings; while an oval dish contained a skinned and gutted rabbit,\r\nwith its four legs wide apart, its head bleeding, and is kidneys\r\nshowing through its gashed belly. A streamlet of dark blood, after\r\ntrickling along its back to its tail, had fallen drop by drop, staining\r\nthe whiteness of the dish. Marjolin had not even taken the trouble to\r\nwipe the block, near which the rabbit\u2019s feet were still lying. He\r\nreclined there with his eyes half closed, encompassed by other piles of\r\ndead poultry which crowded the shelves of the stall, poultry in paper\r\nwrappers like bouquets, rows upon rows of protuberant breasts and bent\r\nlegs showing confusedly. And amidst all this mass of food, the young\r\nfellow\u2019s big, fair figure, the flesh of his cheeks, hands, and powerful\r\nneck covered with ruddy down seemed as soft as that of the magnificent\r\nturkeys, and as plump as the breasts of the fat geese.\r\n\r\nWhen he caught sight of Lisa, he at once sprang up, blushing at having\r\nbeen caught sprawling in this way. He always seemed very nervous and\r\nill at ease in Madame Quenu\u2019s presence; and when she asked him if\r\nMonsieur Gavard was there, he stammered out: \u201CNo, I don\u2019t think so. He\r\nwas here a little while ago, but he want away again.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa looked at him, smiling; she had a great liking for him. But\r\nfeeling something warm brush against her hand, which was hanging by her\r\nside, she raised a little shriek. Some live rabbits were thrusting\r\ntheir noses out of a box under the counter of the stall, and sniffing\r\nat her skirts.\r\n\r\n\u201COh,\u201D she exclaimed with a laugh, \u201Cit\u2019s your rabbits that are tickling\r\nme.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she stooped and attempted to stroke a white rabbit, which darted\r\nin alarm into a corner of the box.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill Monsieur Gavard be back soon, do you think?\u201D she asked, as she\r\nagain rose erect.\r\n\r\nMarjolin once more replied that he did not know; then in a hesitating\r\nway he continued: \u201CHe\u2019s very likely gone down into the cellars. He told\r\nme, I think, that he was going there.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I think I\u2019ll wait for him, then,\u201D replied Lisa. \u201CCould you let\r\nhim know that I am here? or I might go down to him, perhaps. Yes,\r\nthat\u2019s a good idea; I\u2019ve been intending to go and have a look at the\r\ncellars for these last five years. You\u2019ll take me down, won\u2019t you, and\r\nexplain things to me?\u201D\r\n\r\nMarjolin blushed crimson, and, hurrying out of the stall, walked on in\r\nfront of her, leaving the poultry to look after itself. \u201COf course I\r\nwill,\u201D said he. \u201CI\u2019ll do anything you wish, Madame Lisa.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen they got down below, the beautiful Lisa felt quite suffocated by\r\nthe dank atmosphere of the cellar. She stood at the bottom step, and\r\nraised her eyes to look at the vaulted roofing of red and white bricks\r\narching slightly between the iron ribs upheld by small columns. What\r\nmade her hesitate more than the gloominess of the place was a warm,\r\npenetrating odour, the exhalations of large numbers of living\r\ncreatures, which irritated her nostrils and throat.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a nasty smell!\u201D she exclaimed. \u201CIt must be very unhealthy down\r\nhere.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt never does me any harm,\u201D replied Marjolin in astonishment. \u201CThere\u2019s\r\nnothing unpleasant about the smell when you\u2019ve got accustomed to it;\r\nand it\u2019s very warm and cosy down here in the wintertime.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs Lisa followed him, however, she declared that the strong scent of\r\nthe poultry quite turned her stomach, and that she would certainly not\r\nbe able to eat a fowl for the next two months. All around her, the\r\nstorerooms, the small cabins where the stallkeepers keep their live\r\nstock, formed regular streets, intersecting each other at right angles.\r\nThere were only a few scattered gas lights, and the little alleys\r\nseemed wrapped in sleep like the lanes of a village where the\r\ninhabitants have all gone to bed. Marjolin made Lisa feel the\r\nclose-meshed wiring, stretched on a framework of cast iron; and as she\r\nmade her way along one of the streets she amused herself by reading the\r\nnames of the different tenants, which were inscribed on blue labels.\r\n\r\n\u201CMonsieur Gavard\u2019s place is quite at the far end,\u201D said the young man,\r\nstill walking on.\r\n\r\nThey turned to the left, and found themselves in a sort of blind alley,\r\na dark, gloomy spot where not a ray of light penetrated. Gavard was not\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, it makes no difference,\u201D said Marjolin. \u201CI can show you our birds\r\njust the same. I have a key of the storeroom.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa followed him into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t suppose that I can see your birds in this black oven, do\r\nyou?\u201D she asked, laughing.\r\n\r\nMarjolin did not reply at once; but presently he stammered out that\r\nthere was always a candle in the storeroom. He was fumbling about the\r\nlock, and seemed quite unable to find the keyhole. As Lisa came up to\r\nhelp him, she felt a hot breath on her neck; and when the young man had\r\nat last succeeded in opening the door and lighted the candle, she saw\r\nthat he was trembling.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou silly fellow!\u201D she exclaimed, \u201Cto get yourself into such a state\r\njust because a door won\u2019t open! Why, you\u2019re no better than a girl, in\r\nspite of your big fists!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe stepped inside the storeroom. Gavard had rented two compartments,\r\nwhich he had thrown into one by removing the partition between them. In\r\nthe dirt on the floor wallowed the larger birds\u2014the geese, turkeys, and\r\nducks\u2014while up above, on tiers of shelves, were boxes with barred\r\nfronts containing fowls and rabbits. The grating of the storeroom was\r\nso coated with dust and cobwebs that it looked as though covered with\r\ngrey blinds. The woodwork down below was rotting, and covered with\r\nfilth. Lisa, however, not wishing to vex Marjolin, refrained from any\r\nfurther expression of disgust. She pushed her fingers between the bars\r\nof the boxes, and began to lament the fate of the unhappy fowls, which\r\nwere so closely huddled together and could not even stand upright. Then\r\nshe stroked a duck with a broken leg which was squatting in a corner,\r\nand the young man told her that it would be killed that very evening,\r\nfor fear lest it should die during the night.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut what do they do for food?\u201D asked Lisa.\r\n\r\nThereupon he explained to her that poultry would not eat in the dark,\r\nand that it was necessary to light a candle and wait there till they\r\nhad finished their meal.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt amuses me to watch them,\u201D he continued; \u201CI often stay here with a\r\nlight for hours altogether. You should see how they peck away; and when\r\nI hide the flame of the candle with my hand they all stand stock-still\r\nwith their necks in the air, just as though the sun had set. It is\r\nagainst the rules to leave a lighted candle here and go away. One of\r\nthe dealers, old Mother Palette\u2014you know her, don\u2019t you?\u2014nearly burned\r\nthe whole place down the other day. A fowl must have knocked the candle\r\nover into the straw while she was away.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA pretty thing, isn\u2019t it,\u201D said Lisa, \u201Cfor fowls to insist upon having\r\nthe chandeliers lighted up every time they take a meal?\u201D\r\n\r\nThis idea made her laugh. Then she came out of the storeroom, wiping\r\nher feet, and holding up her skirts to keep them from the filth.\r\nMarjolin blew out the candle and locked the door. Lisa felt rather\r\nnervous at finding herself in the dark again with this big young\r\nfellow, and so she hastened on in front.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m glad I came, all the same,\u201D she presently said, as he joined her.\r\n\u201CThere is a great deal more under these markets than I ever imagined.\r\nBut I must make haste now and get home again. They\u2019ll wonder what has\r\nbecome of me at the shop. If Monsieur Gavard comes back, tell him that\r\nI want to speak to him immediately.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI expect he\u2019s in the killing-room,\u201D said Marjolin. \u201CWe\u2019ll go and see,\r\nif you like.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa made no reply. She felt oppressed by the close atmosphere which\r\nwarmed her face. She was quite flushed, and her bodice, generally so\r\nstill and lifeless, began to heave. Moreover, the sound of Marjolin\u2019s\r\nhurrying steps behind her filled her with an uneasy feeling. At last\r\nshe stepped aside, and let him go on in front. The lanes of this\r\nunderground village were still fast asleep. Lisa noticed that her\r\ncompanion was taking the longest way. When they came out in front of\r\nthe railway track he told her that he had wished to show it to her; and\r\nthey stood for a moment or two looking through the chinks in the\r\nhoarding of heavy beams. Then Marjolin proposed to take her on to the\r\nline; but she refused, saying that it was not worth while, as she could\r\nsee things well enough where she was.\r\n\r\nAs they returned to the poultry cellars they found old Madame Palette\r\nin front of her storeroom, removing the cords of a large square hamper,\r\nin which a furious fluttering of wings and scraping of feet could be\r\nheard. As she unfastened the last knot the lid suddenly flew open, as\r\nthough shot up by a spring, and some big geese thrust out their heads\r\nand necks. Then, in wild alarm, they sprang from their prison and\r\nrushed away, craning their necks, and filling the dark cellars with a\r\nfrightful noise of hissing and clattering of beaks. Lisa could not help\r\nlaughing, in spite of the lamentations of the old woman, who swore like\r\na carter as she caught hold of two of the absconding birds and dragged\r\nthem back by the neck. Marjolin, meantime, set off in pursuit of a\r\nthird. They could hear him running along the narrow alleys, hunting for\r\nthe runaway, and delighting in the chase. Then, far off in the\r\ndistance, they heard the sounds of a struggle, and presently Marjolin\r\ncame back again, bringing the goose with him. Mother Palette, a\r\nsallow-faced old woman, took it in her arms and clasped it for a moment\r\nto her bosom, in the classic attitude of Leda.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, well, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what I should have done if you\r\nhadn\u2019t been here,\u201D said she. \u201CThe other day I had a regular fight with\r\none of the brutes; but I had my knife with me, and I cut its throat.\u201D\r\n\r\nMarjolin was quite out of breath. When they reached the stone blocks\r\nwhere the poultry were killed, and where the gas burnt more brightly,\r\nLisa could see that he was perspiring, and had bold, glistening eyes.\r\nShe thought he looked very handsome like that, with his broad\r\nshoulders, big flushed face, and fair curly hair, and she looked at him\r\nso complacently, with that air of admiration which women feel they may\r\nsafely express for quite young lads, that he relapsed into timid\r\nbashfulness again.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, Monsieur Gavard isn\u2019t here, you see,\u201D she said. \u201CYou\u2019ve only\r\nmade me waste my time.\u201D\r\n\r\nMarjolin, however, began rapidly explaining the killing of the poultry\r\nto her. Five huge stone slabs stretched out in the direction of the Rue\r\nRambuteau under the yellow light of the gas jets. A woman was killing\r\nfowls at one end; and this led him to tell Lisa that the birds were\r\nplucked almost before they were dead, the operation thus being much\r\neasier. Then he wanted her to feel the feathers which were lying in\r\nheaps on the stone slabs; and told her that they were sorted and sold\r\nfor as much as nine sous the pound, according to their quality. To\r\nsatisfy him, she was also obliged to plunge her hand into the big\r\nhampers full of down. Then he turned the water-taps, of which there was\r\none by every pillar. There was no end to the particulars he gave. The\r\nblood, he said, streamed along the stone blocks, and collected into\r\npools on the paved floor, which attendants sluiced with water every two\r\nhours, removing the more recent stains with coarse brushes.\r\n\r\nWhen Lisa stooped over the drain which carries away the swillings,\r\nMarjolin found a fresh text for talk. On rainy days, said he, the water\r\nsometimes rose through this orifice and flooded the place. It had once\r\nrisen a foot high; and they had been obliged to transport all the\r\npoultry to the other end of the cellar, which is on a higher level. He\r\nlaughed as he recalled the wild flutter of the terrified creatures.\r\nHowever, he had now finished, and it seemed as though there remained\r\nnothing else for him to show, when all at once he bethought himself of\r\nthe ventilator. Thereupon he took Lisa off to the far end of the\r\ncellar, and told her to look up; and inside one of the turrets at the\r\ncorner angles of the pavilion she observed a sort of escape-pipe, by\r\nwhich the foul atmosphere of the storerooms ascended into space.\r\n\r\nHere, in this corner, reeking with abominable odours, Marjolin\u2019s\r\nnostrils quivered, and his breath came and went violently. His long\r\nstroll with Lisa in these cellars, full of warm animal perfumes, had\r\ngradually intoxicated him.\r\n\r\nShe had again turned towards him. \u201CWell,\u201D said she, \u201Cit was very kind\r\nof you to show me all this, and when you come to the shop I will give\r\nyou something.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhilst speaking she took hold of his soft chin, as she often did,\r\nwithout recognising that he was no longer a child; and perhaps she\r\nallowed her hand to linger there a little longer than was her wont. At\r\nall events, Marjolin, usually so bashful, was thrilled by the caress,\r\nand all at once he impetuously sprang forward, clasped Lisa by the\r\nshoulders, and pressed his lips to her soft cheeks. She raised no cry,\r\nbut turned very pale at this sudden attack, which showed her how\r\nimprudent she had been. And then, freeing herself from the embrace, she\r\nraised her arm, as she had seen men do in slaughter houses, clenched\r\nher comely fist, and knocked Marjolin down with a single blow, planted\r\nstraight between his eyes; and as he fell his head came into collision\r\nwith one of the stone slabs, and was split open. Just at that moment\r\nthe hoarse and prolonged crowing of a cock sounded through the gloom.\r\n\r\nHandsome Lisa, however, remained perfectly cool. Her lips were tightly\r\ncompressed, and her bosom had recovered its wonted immobility. Up above\r\nshe could hear the heavy rumbling of the markets, and through the\r\nvent-holes alongside the Rue Rambuteau the noise of the street traffic\r\nmade its way into the oppressive silence of the cellar. Lisa reflected\r\nthat her own strong arm had saved her; and then, fearing lest some one\r\nshould come and find her there, she hastened off, without giving a\r\nglance at Marjolin. As she climbed the steps, after passing through the\r\ngrated entrance of the cellars, the daylight brought her great relief.\r\n\r\nShe returned to the shop, quite calm, and only looking a little pale.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve been a long time,\u201D Quenu said to her.\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t find Gavard. I have looked for him everywhere,\u201D she quietly\r\nreplied. \u201CWe shall have to eat our leg of mutton without him.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she filled the lard pot, which she noticed was empty; and cut some\r\npork chops for her friend Madame Taboureau, who had sent her little\r\nservant for them. The blows which she dealt with her cleaver reminded\r\nher of Marjolin. She felt that she had nothing to reproach herself\r\nwith. She had acted like an honest woman. She was not going to disturb\r\nher peace of mind; she was too happy to do anything to compromise\r\nherself. However, she glanced at Quenu, whose neck was coarse and\r\nruddy, and whose shaven chin looked as rough as knotted wood; whereas\r\nMarjolin\u2019s chin and neck resembled rosy satin. But then she must not\r\nthink of him any more, for he was no longer a child. She regretted it,\r\nand could not help thinking that children grew up much too quickly.\r\n\r\nA slight flush came back to her cheeks, and Quenu considered that she\r\nlooked wonderfully blooming. He came and sat down beside her at the\r\ncounter for a moment or two. \u201CYou ought to go out oftener,\u201D said he;\r\n\u201Cit does you good. We\u2019ll go to the theatre together one of these\r\nnights, if you like; to the Gait\u00E9, eh? Madame Taboureau has been to see\r\nthe piece they are playing there, and she declares it\u2019s splendid.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa smiled, and said they would see about it, and then once more she\r\ntook herself off. Quenu thought that it was too good of her to take so\r\nmuch trouble in running about after that brute Gavard. In point of\r\nfact, however, she had simply gone upstairs to Florent\u2019s bedroom, the\r\nkey of which was hanging from a nail in the kitchen. She hoped to find\r\nout something or other by an inspection of this room, since the poultry\r\ndealer had failed her. She went slowly round it, examining the bed, the\r\nmantelpiece, and every corner. The window with the little balcony was\r\nopen, and the budding pomegranate was steeped in the golden beams of\r\nthe setting sun. The room looked to her as though Augustine had never\r\nleft it\u2014had slept there only the night before. There seemed to be\r\nnothing masculine about the place. She was quite surprised, for she had\r\nexpected to find some suspicious-looking chests, and coffers with\r\nstrong locks. She went to feel Augustine\u2019s summer gown, which was still\r\nhanging against the wall. Then she sat down at the table, and began to\r\nread an unfinished page of manuscript, in which the word \u201Crevolution\u201D\r\noccurred twice. This alarmed her, and she opened the drawer, which she\r\nsaw was full of papers. But her sense of honour awoke within her in\r\npresence of the secret which the rickety deal table so badly guarded.\r\nShe remained bending over the papers, trying to understand them without\r\ntouching them, in a state of great emotion, when the shrill song of the\r\nchaffinch, on whose cage streamed a ray of sunshine, made her start.\r\nShe closed the drawer. It was a base thing that she had contemplated,\r\nshe thought.\r\n\r\nThen, as she lingered by the window, reflecting that she ought to go\r\nand ask counsel of Abb\u00E9 Roustan, who was a very sensible man, she saw a\r\ncrowd of people round a stretcher in the market square below. The night\r\nwas falling, still she distinctly recognised Cadine weeping in the\r\nmidst of the crowd; while Florent and Claude, whose boots were white\r\nwith dust, stood together talking earnestly at the edge of the footway.\r\nShe hurried downstairs again, surprised to see them back so soon, and\r\nscarcely had she reached her counter when Mademoiselle Saget entered\r\nthe shop.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey have found that scamp of a Marjolin in the cellar, with his head\r\nsplit open,\u201D exclaimed the old maid. \u201CWon\u2019t you come to see him, Madame\r\nQuenu?\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa crossed the road to look at him. The young fellow was lying on his\r\nback on the stretcher, looking very pale. His eyes were closed, and a\r\nstiff wisp of his fair hair was clotted with blood. The bystanders,\r\nhowever, declared that there was no serious harm done, and, besides,\r\nthe scamp had only himself to blame, for he was always playing all\r\nsorts of wild pranks in the cellars. It was generally supposed that he\r\nhad been trying to jump over one of the stone blocks\u2014one of his\r\nfavourite amusements\u2014and had fallen with his head against the slab.\r\n\r\n\u201CI dare say that hussy there gave him a shove,\u201D remarked Mademoiselle\r\nSaget, pointing to Cadine, who was weeping. \u201CThey are always larking\r\ntogether.\u201D\r\n\r\nMeantime the fresh air had restored Marjolin to consciousness, and he\r\nopened his eyes in wide astonishment. He looked round at everybody, and\r\nthen, observing Lisa bending over him, he gently smiled at her with an\r\nexpression of mingled humility and affection. He seemed to have\r\nforgotten all that had happened. Lisa, feeling relieved, said that he\r\nought to be taken to the hospital at once, and promised to go and see\r\nhim there, and take him some oranges and biscuits. However, Marjolin\u2019s\r\nhead had fallen back, and when the stretcher was carried away Cadine\r\nfollowed it, with her flat basket slung round her neck, and her hot\r\ntears rolling down upon the bunches of violets in their mossy bed. She\r\ncertainly had no thoughts for the flowers that she was thus scalding\r\nwith her bitter grief.\r\n\r\nAs Lisa went back to her shop, she heard Claude say, as he shook hands\r\nwith Florent and parted from him: \u201CAh! the confounded young scamp! He\u2019s\r\nquite spoiled my day for me! Still, we had a very enjoyable time,\r\ndidn\u2019t we?\u201D\r\n\r\nClaude and Florent had returned both worried and happy, bringing with\r\nthem the pleasant freshness of the country air. Madame Francois had\r\ndisposed of all her vegetables that morning before daylight; and they\r\nhad all three gone to the Golden Compasses, in the Rue Montorgueil, to\r\nget the cart. Here, in the middle of Paris, they found a foretaste of\r\nthe country. Behind the Restaurant Philippe, with its frontage of gilt\r\nwoodwork rising to the first floor, there was a yard like that of a\r\nfarm, dirty, teeming with life, reeking with the odour of manure and\r\nstraw. Bands of fowls were pecking at the soft ground. Sheds and\r\nstaircases and galleries of greeny wood clung to the old houses around,\r\nand at the far end, in a shanty of big beams, was Balthazar, harnessed\r\nto the cart, and eating the oats in his nosebag. He went down the Rue\r\nMontorgueil at a slow trot, seemingly well pleased to return to\r\nNanterre so soon. However, he was not going home without a load. Madame\r\nFrancois had a contract with the company which undertook the scavenging\r\nof the markets, and twice a week she carried off with her a load of\r\nleaves, forked up from the mass of refuse which littered the square. It\r\nmade excellent manure. In a few minutes the cart was filled to\r\noverflowing. Claude and Florent stretched themselves out on the deep\r\nbed of greenery; Madame Francois grasped her reins, and Balthazar went\r\noff at his slow, steady pace, his head somewhat bent by reason of there\r\nbeing so many passengers to pull along.\r\n\r\nThis excursion had been talked of for a long time past. Madame Francois\r\nlaughed cheerily. She was partial to the two men, and promised them an\r\n_omelette au lard_ as had never been eaten, said she, in \u201Cthat\r\nvillainous Paris.\u201D Florent and Claude revelled in the thought of this\r\nday of lounging idleness which as yet had scarcely begun to dawn.\r\nNanterre seemed to be some distant paradise into which they would\r\npresently enter.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you quite comfortable?\u201D Madame Francois asked as the cart turned\r\ninto the Rue du Pont Neuf.\r\n\r\nClaude declared that their couch was as soft as a bridal bed. Lying on\r\ntheir backs, with their hands crossed under their heads, both men were\r\nlooking up at the pale sky from which the stars were vanishing. All\r\nalong the Rue de Rivoli they kept unbroken silence, waiting till they\r\nshould have got clear of the houses, and listening to the worthy woman\r\nas she chattered to Balthazar: \u201CTake your time, old man,\u201D she said to\r\nhim in kindly tones. \u201CWe\u2019re in no hurry; we shall be sure to get there\r\nat last.\u201D\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Champs Elysees, when the artist saw nothing but\r\ntree-tops on either side of him, and the great green mass of the\r\nTuileries gardens in the distance, he woke up, as it were, and began to\r\ntalk. When the cart had passed the end of the Rue du Roule he had\r\ncaught a glimpse of the side entrance of Saint Eustache under the giant\r\nroofing of one of the market covered-ways. He was constantly referring\r\nto this view of the church, and tried to give it a symbolical meaning.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s an odd mixture,\u201D he said, \u201Cthat bit of church framed round by an\r\navenue of cast iron. The one will kill the other; the iron will slay\r\nthe stone, and the time is not very far off. Do you believe in chance,\r\nFlorent? For my part, I don\u2019t think that it was any mere chance of\r\nposition that set a rose-window of Saint Eustache right in the middle\r\nof the central markets. No; there\u2019s a whole manifesto in it. It is\r\nmodern art, realism, naturalism\u2014whatever you like to call it\u2014that has\r\ngrown up and dominates ancient art. Don\u2019t you agree with me?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as Florent still kept silence, Claude continued: \u201CBesides, that\r\nchurch is a piece of bastard architecture, made up of the dying gasp of\r\nthe middle ages, and the first stammering of the Renaissance. Have you\r\nnoticed what sort of churches are built nowadays? They resemble all\r\nkinds of things\u2014libraries, observatories, pigeon-cotes, barracks; and\r\nsurely no one can imagine that the Deity dwells in such places. The\r\npious old builders are all dead and gone; and it would be better to\r\ncease erecting those hideous carcasses of stone, in which we have no\r\nbelief to enshrine. Since the beginning of the century there has only\r\nbeen one large original pile of buildings erected in Paris\u2014a pile in\r\naccordance with modern developments\u2014and that\u2019s the central markets. You\r\nhear me, Florent? Ah! they are a fine bit of building, though they but\r\nfaintly indicate what we shall see in the twentieth century! And so,\r\nyou see, Saint Eustache is done for! It stands there with its\r\nrose-windows, deserted by worshippers, while the markets spread out by\r\nits side and teem with noisy life. Yes! that\u2019s how I understand it all,\r\nmy friend.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! Monsieur Claude,\u201D said Madame Francois, laughing, \u201Cthe woman who\r\ncut your tongue-string certainly earned her money. Look at Balthazar\r\nlaying his ears back to listen to you. Come, come, get along,\r\nBalthazar!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe cart was slowly making its way up the incline. At this early hour\r\nof the morning the avenue, with its double lines of iron chairs on\r\neither pathway, and its lawns, dotted with flowerbeds and clumps of\r\nshrubbery, stretching away under the blue shadows of the trees, was\r\nquite deserted; however, at the Rond-Point a lady and gentleman on\r\nhorseback passed the cart at a gentle trot. Florent, who had made\r\nhimself a pillow with a bundle of cabbage-leaves, was still gazing at\r\nthe sky, in which a far-stretching rosy glow was appearing. Every now\r\nand then he would close his eyes, the better to enjoy the fresh breeze\r\nof the morning as it fanned his face. He was so happy to escape from\r\nthe markets, and travel on through the pure air, that he remained\r\nspeechless, and did not even listen to what was being said around him.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd then, too, what fine jokers are those fellows who imprison art in\r\na toy-box!\u201D resumed Claude, after a pause. \u201CThey are always repeating\r\nthe same idiotic words: \u2018You can\u2019t create art out of science,\u2019 says\r\none; \u2018Mechanical appliances kill poetry,\u2019 says another; and a pack of\r\nfools wail over the fate of the flowers, as though anybody wished the\r\nflowers any harm! I\u2019m sick of all such twaddle; I should like to answer\r\nall that snivelling with some work of open defiance. I should take a\r\npleasure in shocking those good people. Shall I tell you what was the\r\nfinest thing I ever produced since I first began to work, and the one\r\nwhich I recall with the greatest pleasure? It\u2019s quite a story. When I\r\nwas at my Aunt Lisa\u2019s on Christmas Eve last year that idiot of an\r\nAuguste, the assistant, was setting out the shop-window. Well, he quite\r\nirritated me by the weak, spiritless way in which he arranged the\r\ndisplay; and at last I requested him to take himself off, saying that I\r\nwould group the things myself in a proper manner. You see, I had plenty\r\nof bright colours to work with\u2014the red of the tongues, the yellow of\r\nthe hams, the blue of the paper shavings, the rosy pink of the things\r\nthat had been cut into, the green of the sprigs of heath, and the black\r\nof the black-puddings\u2014ah! a magnificent black, which I have never\r\nmanaged to produce on my palette. And naturally, the _crepine_, the\r\nsmall sausages, the chitterlings, and the crumbed trotters provided me\r\nwith delicate greys and browns. I produced a perfect work of art. I\r\ntook the dishes, the plates, the pans, and the jars, and arranged the\r\ndifferent colours; and I devised a wonderful picture of still life,\r\nwith subtle scales of tints leading up to brilliant flashes of colour.\r\nThe red tongues seemed to thrust themselves out like greedy flames, and\r\nthe black-puddings, surrounded by pale sausages, suggested a dark night\r\nfraught with terrible indigestion. I had produced, you see, a picture\r\nsymbolical of the gluttony of Christmas Eve, when people meet and\r\nsup\u2014the midnight feasting, the ravenous gorging of stomachs void and\r\nfaint after all the singing of hymns.[*] At the top of everything a\r\nhuge turkey exhibited its white breast, marbled blackly by the truffles\r\nshowing through its skin. It was something barbaric and superb,\r\nsuggesting a paunch amidst a halo of glory; but there was such a\r\ncutting, sarcastic touch about it all that people crowded to the\r\nwindow, alarmed by the fierce flare of the shop-front. When my aunt\r\nLisa came back from the kitchen she was quite frightened, and thought\r\nI\u2019d set the fat in the shop on fire; and she considered the appearance\r\nof the turkey so indelicate that she turned me out of the place while\r\nAuguste re-arranged the window after his own idiotic fashion. Such\r\nbrutes will never understand the language of a red splotch by the side\r\nof a grey one. Ah, well! that was my masterpiece. I have never done\r\nanything better.\u201D\r\n\r\n[*] An allusion to the \u201Cmidnight mass\u201D usually celebrated in Roman\r\nCatholic churches on Christmas Eve.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe relapsed into silence, smiling and dwelling with gratification on\r\nthis reminiscence. The cart had now reached the Arc de Triomphe, and\r\nstrong currents of air swept from the avenues across the expanse of\r\nopen ground. Florent sat up, and inhaled with zest the first odours of\r\ngrass wafted from the fortifications. He turned his back on Paris,\r\nanxious to behold the country in the distance. At the corner of the Rue\r\nde Longchamp, Madame Francois pointed out to him the spot where she had\r\npicked him up. This rendered him thoughtful, and he gazed at her as she\r\nsat there, so healthy-looking and serene, with her arms slightly\r\nextended so as to grasp the reins. She looked even handsomer than Lisa,\r\nwith her neckerchief tied over her head, her robust glow of health, and\r\nher brusque, kindly air. When she gave a slight cluck with her tongue,\r\nBalthazar pricked up his ears and rattled down the road at a quicker\r\npace.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Nanterre, the cart turned to the left into a narrow\r\nlane, skirted some blank walls, and finally came to a standstill at the\r\nend of a sort of blind alley. It was the end of the world, Madame\r\nFrancois used to say. The load of vegetable leaves now had to be\r\ndischarged. Claude and Florent would not hear of the journeyman\r\ngardener, who was planting lettuces, leaving his work, but armed\r\nthemselves with pitchforks and proceeded to toss the leaves into the\r\nmanure pit. This occupation afforded them much amusement. Claude had\r\nquite a liking for manure, since it symbolises the world and its life.\r\nThe strippings and parings of the vegetables, the scourings of the\r\nmarkets, the refuse that fell from that colossal table, remained full\r\nof life, and returned to the spot where the vegetables had previously\r\nsprouted, to warm and nourish fresh generations of cabbages, turnips,\r\nand carrots. They rose again in fertile crops, and once more went to\r\nspread themselves out upon the market square. Paris rotted everything,\r\nand returned everything to the soil, which never wearied of repairing\r\nthe ravages of death.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D exclaimed Claude, as he plied his fork for the last time, \u201Chere\u2019s\r\na cabbage-stalk that I\u2019m sure I recognise. It has grown up at least\r\nhalf a score of times in that corner yonder by the apricot tree.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis remark made Florent laugh. But he soon became grave again, and\r\nstrolled slowly through the kitchen garden, while Claude made a sketch\r\nof the stable, and Madame Francois got breakfast ready. The kitchen\r\ngarden was a long strip of ground, divided in the middle by a narrow\r\npath; it rose slightly, and at the top end, on raising the head, you\r\ncould perceive the low barracks of Mont Valerien. Green hedges\r\nseparated it from other plots of land, and these lofty walls of\r\nhawthorn fringed the horizon with a curtain of greenery in such wise\r\nthat of all the surrounding country Mont Valerien alone seemed to rise\r\ninquisitively on tip-toe in order to peer into Madame Francois\u2019s close.\r\nGreat peacefulness came from the countryside which could not be seen.\r\nAlong the kitchen garden, between the four hedges, the May sun shone\r\nwith a languid heat, a silence disturbed only by the buzzing of\r\ninsects, a somnolence suggestive of painless parturition. Every now and\r\nthen a faint cracking sound, a soft sigh, made one fancy that one could\r\nhear the vegetables sprout into being. The patches of spinach and\r\nsorrel, the borders of radishes, carrots, and turnips, the beds of\r\npotatoes and cabbages, spread out in even regularity, displaying their\r\ndark leaf-mould between their tufts of greenery. Farther away, the\r\ntrenched lettuces, onions, leeks, and celery, planted by line in long\r\nstraight rows, looked like soldiers on parade; while the peas and beans\r\nwere beginning to twine their slender tendrils round a forest of\r\nsticks, which, when June came, they would transform into a thick and\r\nverdant wood. There was not a weed to be seen. The garden resembled two\r\nparallel strips of carpet of a geometrical pattern of green on a\r\nreddish ground, which were carefully swept every morning. Borders of\r\nthyme grew like greyish fringe along each side of the pathway.\r\n\r\nFlorent paced backwards and forwards amidst the perfume of the thyme,\r\nwhich the sun was warming. He felt profoundly happy in the peacefulness\r\nand cleanliness of the garden. For nearly a year past he had only seen\r\nvegetables bruised and crushed by the jolting of the market-carts;\r\nvegetables torn up on the previous evening, and still bleeding. He\r\nrejoiced to find them at home, in peace in the dark mould, and sound in\r\nevery part. The cabbages had a bulky, prosperous appearance; the\r\ncarrots looked bright and gay; and the lettuces lounged in line with an\r\nair of careless indolence. And as he looked at them all, the markets\r\nwhich he had left behind him that morning seemed to him like a vast\r\nmortuary, an abode of death, where only corpses could be found, a\r\ncharnel-house reeking with foul smells and putrefaction. He slackened\r\nhis steps, and rested in that kitchen garden, as after a long\r\nperambulation amidst deafening noises and repulsive odours. The uproar\r\nand the sickening humidity of the fish market had departed from him;\r\nand he felt as though he were being born anew in the pure fresh air.\r\nClaude was right, he thought. The markets were a sphere of death. The\r\nsoil was the life, the eternal cradle, the health of the world.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe omelet\u2019s ready!\u201D suddenly cried Madame Francois.\r\n\r\nWhen they were all three seated round the table in the kitchen, with\r\nthe door thrown open to the sunshine, they ate their breakfast with\r\nsuch light-hearted gaiety that Madame Francois looked at Florent in\r\namazement, repeating between each mouthful: \u201CYou\u2019re quite altered.\r\nYou\u2019re ten years younger. It is that villainous Paris which makes you\r\nseem so gloomy. You\u2019ve got a little sunshine in your eyes now. Ah!\r\nthose big towns do one\u2019s health no good, you ought to come and live\r\nhere.\u201D\r\n\r\nClaude laughed, and retorted that Paris was a glorious place. He stuck\r\nup for it and all that belonged to it, even to its gutters; though at\r\nthe same time retaining a keen affection for the country.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Madame Francois and Florent found themselves alone at\r\nthe end of the garden, in a corner planted with a few fruit trees.\r\nSeated on the ground, they talked somewhat seriously together. The good\r\nwoman advised Florent with an affectionate and quite maternal kindness.\r\nShe asked him endless questions about his life, and his intentions for\r\nthe future, and begged him to remember that he might always count upon\r\nher, if ever he thought that she could in the slightest degree\r\ncontribute to his happiness. Florent was deeply touched. No woman had\r\never spoken to him in that way before. Madame Francois seemed to him\r\nlike some healthy, robust plant that had grown up with the vegetables\r\nin the leaf-mould of the garden; while the Lisas, the Normans, and\r\nother pretty women of the markets appeared to him like flesh of\r\ndoubtful freshness decked out for exhibition. He here enjoyed several\r\nhours of perfect well-being, delivered from all that reek of food which\r\nsickened him in the markets, and reviving to new life amidst the\r\nfertile atmosphere of the country, like that cabbage stalk which Claude\r\ndeclared he had seen sprout up more than half a score of times.\r\n\r\nThe two men took leave of Madame Francois at about five o\u2019clock. They\r\nhad decided to walk back to Paris; and the market gardener accompanied\r\nthem into the lane. As she bade good-bye to Florent, she kept his hand\r\nin her own for a moment, and said gently: \u201CIf ever anything happens to\r\ntrouble you, remember to come to me.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor a quarter of an hour Florent walked on without speaking, already\r\ngetting gloomy again, and reflecting that he was leaving health behind\r\nhim. The road to Courbevoie was white with dust. However, both men were\r\nfond of long walks and the ringing of stout boots on the hard ground.\r\nLittle clouds of dust rose up behind their heels at every step, while\r\nthe rays of the sinking sun darted obliquely over the avenue,\r\nlengthening their shadows in such wise that their heads reached the\r\nother side of the road, and journeyed along the opposite footway.\r\n\r\nClaude, swinging his arms, and taking long, regular strides,\r\ncomplacently watched these two shadows, whilst enjoying the rhythmical\r\ncadence of his steps, which he accentuated by a motion of his\r\nshoulders. Presently, however, as though just awaking from a dream, he\r\nexclaimed: \u201CDo you know the \u2018Battle of the Fat and the Thin\u2019?\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent, surprised by the question, replied in the negative; and\r\nthereupon Claude waxed enthusiastic, talking of that series of prints\r\nin very eulogical fashion. He mentioned certain incidents: the Fat, so\r\nswollen that they almost burst, preparing their evening debauch, while\r\nthe Thin, bent double by fasting, looked in from the street with the\r\nappearance of envious laths; and then, again, the Fat, with hanging\r\ncheeks, driving off one of the Thin, who had been audacious enough to\r\nintroduce himself into their midst in lowly humility, and who looked\r\nlike a ninepin amongst a population of balls.\r\n\r\nIn these designs Claude detected the entire drama of human life, and he\r\nended by classifying men into Fat and Thin, two hostile groups, one of\r\nwhich devours the other, and grows fat and sleek and enjoys itself.\r\n\r\n\u201CCain,\u201D said he, \u201Cwas certainly one of the Fat, and Abel one of the\r\nThin. Ever since that first murder, there have been rampant appetites\r\nwhich have drained the life-blood of small eaters. It\u2019s a continual\r\npreying of the stronger upon the weaker; each swallowing his neighbour,\r\nand then getting swallowed in his turn. Beware of the Fat, my friend.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe relapsed into silence for a moment, still watching their two\r\nshadows, which the setting sun elongated more than ever. Then he\r\nmurmured: \u201CYou see, we belong to the Thin\u2014you and I. Those who are no\r\nmore corpulent than we are don\u2019t take up much room in the sunlight,\r\neh?\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent glanced at the two shadows, and smiled. But Claude waxed angry,\r\nand exclaimed: \u201CYou make a mistake if you think it is a laughing\r\nmatter. For my own part, I greatly suffer from being one of the Thin.\r\nIf I were one of the Fat, I could paint at my ease; I should have a\r\nfine studio, and sell my pictures for their weight in gold. But,\r\ninstead of that, I\u2019m one of the Thin; and I have to grind my life out\r\nin producing things which simply make the Fat ones shrug their\r\nshoulders. I shall die of it all in the end, I\u2019m sure of it, with my\r\nskin clinging to my bones, and so flattened that they will be able to\r\nbury me between two leaves of a book. And you, too, you are one of the\r\nThin, a wonderful one; the very king of Thin, in fact! Do you remember\r\nyour quarrel with the fish-wives? It was magnificent; all those\r\ncolossal bosoms flying at your scraggy breast! Oh! they were simply\r\nacting from natural instinct; they were pursuing one of the Thin just\r\nas cats pursue a mouse. The Fat, you know, have an instinctive hatred\r\nof the Thin, to such an extent that they must needs drive the latter\r\nfrom their sight, either by means of their teeth or their feet. And\r\nthat is why, if I were in your place, I should take my precautions. The\r\nQuenus belong to the Fat, and so do the Mehudins; indeed, you have none\r\nbut Fat ones around you. I should feel uneasy under such\r\ncircumstances.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what about Gavard, and Mademoiselle Saget, and your friend\r\nMarjolin?\u201D asked Florent, still smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, if you like, I will classify all our acquaintances for you,\u201D\r\nreplied Claude. \u201CI\u2019ve had their heads in a portfolio in my studio for a\r\nlong time past, with memoranda of the order to which they belong.\r\nGavard is one of the Fat, but of the kind which pretends to belong to\r\nthe Thin. The variety is by no means uncommon. Mademoiselle Saget and\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur belong to the Thin, but to a variety which is much to be\r\nfeared\u2014the Thin ones whom envy drives to despair, and who are capable\r\nof anything in their craving to fatten themselves. My friend Marjolin,\r\nlittle Cadine, and La Sarriette are three Fat ones, still innocent,\r\nhowever, and having nothing but the guileless hunger of youth. I may\r\nremark that the Fat, so long as they\u2019ve not grown old, are charming\r\ncreatures. Monsieur Lebigre is one of the Fat\u2014don\u2019t you think so? As\r\nfor your political friends, Charvet, Clemence, Logre, and Lacaille,\r\nthey mostly belong to the Thin. I only except that big animal\r\nAlexandre, and that prodigy Robine, who has caused me a vast amount of\r\nannoyance.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe artist continued to talk in this strain from the Pont de Neuilly to\r\nthe Arc de Triomphe. He returned to some of those whom he had already\r\nmentioned, and completed their portraits with a few characteristic\r\ntouches. Logre, he said, was one of the Thin whose belly had been\r\nplaced between his shoulders. Beautiful Lisa was all stomach, and the\r\nbeautiful Norman all bosom. Mademoiselle Saget, in her earlier life,\r\nmust have certainly lost some opportunity to fatten herself, for she\r\ndetested the Fat, while, at the same time, she despised the Thin. As\r\nfor Gavard, he was compromising his position as one of the Fat, and\r\nwould end by becoming as flat as a bug.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what about Madame Francois?\u201D Florent asked.\r\n\r\nClaude seemed much embarrassed by this question. He cast about for an\r\nanswer, and at last stammered:\r\n\r\n\u201CMadame Francois, Madame Francois\u2014well, no, I really don\u2019t know; I\r\nnever thought about classifying her. But she\u2019s a dear good soul, and\r\nthat\u2019s quite sufficient. She\u2019s neither one of the Fat nor one of the\r\nThin!\u201D\r\n\r\nThey both laughed. They were now in front of the Arc de Triomphe. The\r\nsun, over by the hills of Suresnes, was so low on the horizon that\r\ntheir colossal shadows streaked the whiteness of the great structure\r\neven above the huge groups of statuary, like strokes made with a piece\r\nof charcoal. This increased Claude\u2019s merriment, he waved his arms and\r\nbent his body; and then, as he started on his way again, he said; \u201CDid\r\nyou notice\u2014just as the sun set our two heads shot up to the sky!\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Florent no longer smiled. Paris was grasping him again, that Paris\r\nwhich now frightened him so much, after having cost him so many tears\r\nat Cayenne. When he reached the markets night was falling, and there\r\nwas a suffocating smell. He bent his head as he once more returned to\r\nthe nightmare of endless food, whilst preserving the sweet yet sad\r\nrecollection of that day of bright health odorous with the perfume of\r\nthyme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nAt about four o\u2019clock on the afternoon of the following day Lisa betook\r\nherself to Saint Eustache. For the short walk across the square she had\r\narrayed herself very seriously in a black silk gown and thick woollen\r\nshawl. The handsome Norman, who, from her stall in the fish market,\r\nwatched her till she vanished into the church porch, was quite amazed.\r\n\r\n\u201CHallo! So the fat thing\u2019s gone in for priests now, has she?\u201D she\r\nexclaimed, with a sneer. \u201CWell, a little holy water may do her good!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was mistaken in her surmises, however, for Lisa was not a devotee.\r\nShe did not observe the ordinances of the Church, but said that she did\r\nher best to lead an honest life, and that this was all that was\r\nnecessary. At the same time, however, she disliked to hear religion\r\nspoken ill of, and often silenced Gavard, who delighted in scandalous\r\nstories of priests and their doings. Talk of that sort seemed to her\r\naltogether improper. Everyone, in her opinion, should be allowed to\r\nbelieve as they pleased, and every scruple should be respected.\r\nBesides, the majority of the clergy were most estimable men. She knew\r\nAbb\u00E9 Roustan, of Saint Eustache\u2014a distinguished priest, a man of shrewd\r\nsense, and one, she thought, whose friendship might be safely relied\r\nupon. And she would wind up by explaining that religion was absolutely\r\nnecessary for the people; she looked upon it as a sort of police force\r\nthat helped to maintain order, and without which no government would be\r\npossible. When Gavard went too far on this subject and asserted that\r\nthe priests ought to be turned into the streets and have their shops\r\nshut up, Lisa, shrugged her shoulders and replied: \u201CA great deal of\r\ngood that would do! Why, before a month was over the people would be\r\nmurdering one another in the streets, and you would be compelled to\r\ninvent another God. That was just what happened in \u201893. You know very\r\nwell that I\u2019m not given to mixing with the priests, but for all that I\r\nsay that they are necessary, as we couldn\u2019t do without them.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd so when Lisa happened to enter a church she always manifested the\r\nutmost decorum. She had bought a handsome missal, which she never\r\nopened, for use when she was invited to a funeral or a wedding. She\r\nknelt and rose at the proper times, and made a point of conducting\r\nherself with all propriety. She assumed, indeed, what she considered a\r\nsort of official demeanour, such as all well-to-do folks, tradespeople,\r\nand house-owners ought to observe with regard to religion.\r\n\r\nAs she entered Saint Eustache that afternoon she let the double doors,\r\ncovered with green baize, faded and worn by the frequent touch of pious\r\nhands, close gently behind her. Then she dipped her fingers in the holy\r\nwater and crossed herself in the correct fashion. And afterwards, with\r\nhushed footsteps, she made her way to the chapel of Saint Agnes, where\r\ntwo kneeling women with their faces buried in their hands were waiting,\r\nwhilst the blue skirts of a third protruded from the confessional. Lisa\r\nseemed rather put out by the sight of these women, and, addressing a\r\nverger who happened to pass along, wearing a black skullcap and\r\ndragging his feet over the slabs, she inquired: \u201CIs this Monsieur\r\nl\u2019Abb\u00E9 Roustan\u2019s day for hearing confessions?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe verger replied that his reverence had only two more penitents\r\nwaiting, and that they would not detain him long, so that if Lisa would\r\ntake a chair her turn would speedily come. She thanked him, without\r\ntelling him that she had not come to confess; and, making up her mind\r\nto wait, she began to pace the church, going as far as the chief\r\nentrance, whence she gazed at the lofty, severe, bare nave stretching\r\nbetween the brightly coloured aisles. Raising her head a little, she\r\nexamined the high altar, which she considered too plain, having no\r\ntaste for the cold grandeur of stonework, but preferring the gilding\r\nand gaudy colouring of the side chapels. Those on the side of the Rue\r\ndu Jour looked greyish in the light which filtered through their dusty\r\nwindows, but on the side of the markets the sunset was lighting up the\r\nstained glass with lovely tints, limpid greens and yellows in\r\nparticular, which reminded Lisa of the bottle of liqueurs in front of\r\nMonsieur Lebigre\u2019s mirror. She came back by this side, which seemed to\r\nbe warmed by the glow of light, and took a passing interest in the\r\nreliquaries, altar ornaments, and paintings steeped in prismatic\r\nreflections. The church was empty, quivering with the silence that fell\r\nfrom its vaulted roofing. Here and there a woman\u2019s dress showed like a\r\ndark splotch amidst the vague yellow of the chairs; and a low buzzing\r\ncame from the closed confessionals. As Lisa again passed the chapel of\r\nSaint Agnes she saw the blue dress still kneeling at Abb\u00E9 Roustan\u2019s\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, if I\u2019d wanted to confess I could have said everything in ten\r\nseconds,\u201D she thought, proud of her irreproachable integrity.\r\n\r\nThen she went on to the end of the church. Behind the high altar, in\r\nthe gloom of a double row of pillars, is the chapel of the Blessed\r\nVirgin, damp and dark and silent. The dim stained windows only show the\r\nflowing crimson and violet robes of saints, which blaze like flames of\r\nmystic love in the solemn, silent adoration of the darkness. It is a\r\nweird, mysterious spot, like some crepuscular nook of paradise solely\r\nillumined by the gleaming stars of two tapers. The four brass lamps\r\nhanging from the roof remain unlighted, and are but faintly seen; on\r\nespying them you think of the golden censers which the angels swing\r\nbefore the throne of Mary. And kneeling on the chairs between the\r\npillars there are always women surrendering themselves languorously to\r\nthe dim spot\u2019s voluptuous charm.\r\n\r\nLisa stood and gazed tranquilly around her. She did not feel the least\r\nemotion, but considered that it was a mistake not to light the lamps.\r\nTheir brightness would have given the place a more cheerful look. The\r\ngloom even struck her as savouring of impropriety. Her face was warmed\r\nby the flames of some candles burning in a candelabrum by her side, and\r\nan old woman armed with a big knife was scraping off the wax which had\r\ntrickled down and congealed into pale tears. And amidst the quivering\r\nsilence, the mute ecstasy of adoration prevailing in the chapel, Lisa\r\nwould distinctly hear the rumbling of the vehicles turning out of the\r\nRue Montmartre, behind the scarlet and purple saints on the windows,\r\nwhilst in the distance the markets roared without a moment\u2019s pause.\r\n\r\nJust as Lisa was leaving the chapel, she saw the younger of the\r\nMehudins, Claire, the dealer in fresh water fish, come in. The girl\r\nlighted a taper at the candelabrum, and then went to kneel behind a\r\npillar, her knees pressed upon the hard stones, and her face so pale\r\nbeneath her loose fair hair that she seemed a corpse. And believing\r\nherself to be securely screened from observation, she gave way to\r\nviolent emotion, and wept hot tears with a passionate outpouring of\r\nprayer which bent her like a rushing wind. Lisa looked on in amazement,\r\nfor the Mehudins were not known to be particularly pious; indeed,\r\nClaire was accustomed to speak of religion and priests in such terms as\r\nto horrify one.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the meaning of this, I wonder?\u201D pondered Lisa, as she again\r\nmade her way to the chapel of Saint Agnes. \u201CThe hussy must have been\r\npoisoning some one or other.\u201D\r\n\r\nAbb\u00E9 Roustan was at last coming out of his confessional. He was a\r\nhandsome man, of some forty years of age, with a smiling, kindly air.\r\nWhen he recognised Madame Quenu he grasped her hand, called her \u201Cdear\r\nlady,\u201D and conducted her to the vestry, where, taking off his surplice,\r\nhe told her that he would be entirely at her service in a moment. They\r\nreturned, the priest in his cassock, bareheaded, and Lisa strutting\r\nalong in her shawl, and paced up and down in front of the side-chapels\r\nadjacent to the Rue du Jour. They conversed together in low tones. The\r\nsunlight was departing from the stained windows, the church was growing\r\ndark, and the retreating footsteps of the last worshippers sounded but\r\nfaintly over the flagstones.\r\n\r\nLisa explained her doubts and scruples to Abb\u00E9 Roustan. There had never\r\nbeen any question of religion between them; she never confessed, but\r\nmerely consulted him in cases of difficulty, because he was shrewd and\r\ndiscreet, and she preferred him, as she sometimes said, to shady\r\nbusiness men redolent of the galleys. The abbe, on his side, manifested\r\ninexhaustible complaisance. He looked up points of law for her in the\r\nCode, pointed out profitable investments, resolved her moral\r\ndifficulties with great tact, recommended tradespeople to her,\r\ninvariably having an answer ready however diverse and complicated her\r\nrequirements might be. And he supplied all this help in a natural\r\nmatter-of-fact way, without ever introducing the Deity into his talk,\r\nor seeking to obtain any advantage either for himself or the cause of\r\nreligion. A word of thanks and a smile sufficed him. He seemed glad to\r\nhave an opportunity of obliging the handsome Madame Quenu, of whom his\r\nhousekeeper often spoke to him in terms of praise, as of a woman who\r\nwas highly respected in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nTheir consultation that afternoon was of a peculiarly delicate nature.\r\nLisa was anxious to know what steps she might legitimately take, as a\r\nwoman of honour, with respect to her brother-in-law. Had she a right to\r\nkeep a watch upon him, and to do what she could to prevent him from\r\ncompromising her husband, her daughter, and herself? And then how far\r\nmight she go in circumstances of pressing danger? She did not bluntly\r\nput these questions to the abbe, but asked them with such skilful\r\ncircumlocutions that he was able to discuss the matter without entering\r\ninto personalities. He brought forward arguments on both sides of the\r\nquestion, but the conclusion he came to was that a person of integrity\r\nwas entitled, indeed bound, to prevent evil, and was justified in using\r\nwhatever means might be necessary to ensure the triumph of that which\r\nwas right and proper.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is my opinion, dear lady,\u201D he said in conclusion. \u201CThe question\r\nof means is always a very grave one. It is a snare in which souls of\r\naverage virtue often become entangled. But I know your scrupulous\r\nconscience. Deliberate carefully over each step you think of taking,\r\nand if it contains nothing repugnant to you, go on boldly. Pure natures\r\nhave the marvelous gift of purifying all that they touch.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, changing his tone of voice, he continued: \u201CPray give my kind\r\nregards to Monsieur Quenu. I\u2019ll come in to kiss my dear little Pauline\r\nsome time when I\u2019m passing. And now good-bye, dear lady; remember that\r\nI\u2019m always at your service.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon he returned to the vestry. Lisa, on her way out, was curious\r\nto see if Claire was still praying, but the girl had gone back to her\r\neels and carp; and in front of the Lady-chapel, which was already\r\nshrouded in darkness, there was now but a litter of chairs overturned\r\nby the ardent vehemence of the woman who had knelt there.\r\n\r\nWhen the handsome Lisa again crossed the square, La Normande, who had\r\nbeen watching for her exit from the church, recognised her in the\r\ntwilight by the rotundity of her skirts.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood gracious!\u201D she exclaimed, \u201Cshe\u2019s been more than an hour in there!\r\nWhen the priests set about cleansing her of her sins, the choir-boys\r\nhave to form in line to pass the buckets of filth and empty them in the\r\nstreet!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe next morning Lisa went straight up to Florent\u2019s bedroom and settled\r\nherself there with perfect equanimity. She felt certain that she would\r\nnot be disturbed, and, moreover, she had made up her mind to tell a\r\nfalsehood and say that she had come to see if the linen was clean,\r\nshould Florent by any chance return. Whilst in the shop, however, she\r\nhad observed him busily engaged in the fish market. Seating herself in\r\nfront of the little table, she pulled out the drawer, placed it upon\r\nher knees, and began to examine its contents, taking the greatest care\r\nto restore them to their original positions.\r\n\r\nFirst of all she came upon the opening chapters of the work on Cayenne;\r\nthen upon the drafts of Florent\u2019s various plans and projects, his\r\nschemes for converting the Octroi duties into taxes upon sales, for\r\nreforming the administrative system of the markets, and all the others.\r\nThese pages of small writing, which she set herself to read, bored her\r\nextremely, and she was about to restore the drawer to its place,\r\nfeeling convinced that Florent concealed the proofs of his wicked\r\ndesigns elsewhere, and already contemplating a searching visitation of\r\nhis mattress, when she discovered a photograph of La Normande in an\r\nenvelope. The impression was rather dark. La Normande was standing up\r\nwith her right arm resting on a broken column. Decked out with all her\r\njewels, and attired in a new silk dress, the fish-girl was smiling\r\nimpudently, and Lisa, at the sight, forgot all about her\r\nbrother-in-law, her fears, and the purpose for which she had come into\r\nthe room. She became quite absorbed in her examination of the portrait,\r\nas often happens when one woman scrutinises the photograph of another\r\nat her ease, without fear of being seen. Never before had she so\r\nfavourable an opportunity to study her rival. She scrutinised her hair,\r\nher nose, her mouth; held the photograph at a distance, and then\r\nbrought it closer again. And, finally, with compressed lips, she read\r\non the back of it, in a big, ugly scrawl: \u201CLouise, to her friend,\r\nFlorent.\u201D This quite scandalised her; to her mind it was a confession,\r\nand she felt a strong impulse to take possession of the photograph, and\r\nkeep it as a weapon against her enemy. However, she slowly replaced it\r\nin the envelope on coming to the conclusion that this course would be\r\nwrong, and reflecting that she would always know where to find it\r\nshould she want it again.\r\n\r\nThen, as she again began turning over the loose sheets of paper, it\r\noccurred to her to look at the back end of the drawer, where Florent\r\nhad relegated Augustine\u2019s needles and thread; and there, between the\r\nmissal and the Dream-book, she discovered what she sought, some\r\nextremely compromising memoranda, simply screened from observation by a\r\nwrapper of grey paper.\r\n\r\nThat idea of an insurrection, of the overthrow of the Empire by means\r\nof an armed rising, which Logre had one evening propounded at Monsieur\r\nLebigre\u2019s, had slowly ripened in Florent\u2019s feverish brain. He soon grew\r\nto see a duty, a mission in it. Therein undoubtedly lay the task to\r\nwhich his escape from Cayenne and his return to Paris predestined him.\r\nBelieving in a call to avenge his leanness upon the city which wallowed\r\nin food while the upholders of right and equity were racked by hunger\r\nin exile, he took upon himself the duties of a justiciary, and dreamt\r\nof rising up, even in the midst of those markets, to sweep away the\r\nreign of gluttony and drunkenness. In a sensitive nature like his, this\r\nidea quickly took root. Everything about him assumed exaggerated\r\nproportions, the wildest fancies possessed him. He imagined that the\r\nmarkets had been conscious of his arrival, and had seized hold of him\r\nthat they might enervate him and poison him with their stenches. Then,\r\ntoo, Lisa wanted to cast a spell over him, and for two or three days at\r\na time he would avoid her, as though she were some dissolving agency\r\nwhich would destroy all his power of will should he approach too\r\nclosely. However, these paroxysms of puerile fear, these wild surgings\r\nof his rebellious brain, always ended in thrills of the gentlest\r\ntenderness, with yearnings to love and be loved, which he concealed\r\nwith a boyish shame.\r\n\r\nIt was more especially in the evening that his mind became blurred by\r\nall his wild imaginings. Depressed by his day\u2019s work, but shunning\r\nsleep from a covert fear\u2014the fear of the annihilation it brought with\r\nit\u2014he would remain later than ever at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, or at the\r\nMehudins\u2019; and on his return home he still refrained from going to bed,\r\nand sat up writing and preparing for the great insurrection. By slow\r\ndegrees he devised a complete system of organisation. He divided Paris\r\ninto twenty sections, one for each arrondissement. Each section would\r\nhave a chief, a sort of general, under whose orders there were to be\r\ntwenty lieutenants commanding twenty companies of affiliated\r\nassociates. Every week, among the chiefs, there would be a\r\nconsultation, which was to be held in a different place each time; and,\r\nthe better to ensure secrecy and discretion, the associates would only\r\ncome in contact with their respective lieutenants, these alone\r\ncommunicating with the chiefs of the sections. It also occurred to\r\nFlorent that it would be as well that the companies should believe\r\nthemselves charged with imaginary missions, as a means of putting the\r\npolice upon a wrong scent.\r\n\r\nAs for the employment of the insurrectionary forces, that would be all\r\nsimplicity. It would, of course, be necessary to wait till the\r\ncompanies were quite complete, and then advantage would be taken of the\r\nfirst public commotion. They would doubtless only have a certain number\r\nof guns used for sporting purposes in their possession, so they would\r\ncommence by seizing the police stations and guard-houses, disarming the\r\nsoldiers of the line; resorting to violence as little as possible, and\r\ninviting the men to make common cause with the people. Afterwards they\r\nwould march upon the Corps L\u00E9gislatif, and thence to the H\u00F4tel de\r\nVille. This plan, to which Florent returned night after night, as\r\nthough it were some dramatic scenario which relieved his over-excited\r\nnervous system, was as yet simply jotted down on scraps of paper, full\r\nof erasures, which showed how the writer had felt his way, and revealed\r\neach successive phase of his scientific yet puerile conception. When\r\nLisa had glanced through the notes, without understanding some of them,\r\nshe remained there trembling with fear; afraid to touch them further\r\nlest they should explode in her hands like live shells.\r\n\r\nA last memorandum frightened her more than any of the others. It was a\r\nhalf sheet of paper on which Florent had sketched the distinguishing\r\ninsignia which the chiefs and the lieutenants were to wear. By the side\r\nof these were rough drawings of the standards which the different\r\ncompanies were to carry; and notes in pencil even described what\r\ncolours the banners should assume. The chiefs were to wear red scarves,\r\nand the lieutenants red armlets.\r\n\r\nTo Lisa this seemed like an immediate realisation of the rising; she\r\nsaw all the men with their red badges marching past the pork shop,\r\nfiring bullets into her mirrors and marble, and carrying off sausages\r\nand chitterlings from the window. The infamous projects of her\r\nbrother-in-law were surely directed against herself\u2014against her own\r\nhappiness. She closed the drawer and looked round the room, reflecting\r\nthat it was she herself who had provided this man with a home\u2014that he\r\nslept between her sheets and used her furniture. And she was especially\r\nexasperated at his keeping his abominable infernal machine in that\r\nlittle deal table which she herself had used at Uncle Gradelle\u2019s before\r\nher marriage\u2014a perfectly innocent, rickety little table.\r\n\r\nFor a while she stood thinking what she should do. In the first place,\r\nit was useless to say anything to Quenu. For a moment it occurred to\r\nher to provoke an explanation with Florent, but she dismissed that\r\nidea, fearing lest he would only go and perpetrate his crime elsewhere,\r\nand maliciously make a point of compromising them. Then gradually\r\ngrowing somewhat calmer, she came to the conclusion that her best plan\r\nwould be to keep a careful watch over her brother-in-law. It would be\r\ntime enough to take further steps at the first sign of danger. She\r\nalready had quite sufficient evidence to send him back to the galleys.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the shop again, she found Augustine in a state of great\r\nexcitement. Little Pauline had disappeared more than half an hour\r\nbefore, and to Lisa\u2019s anxious questions the young woman could only\r\nreply: \u201CI don\u2019t know where she can have got to, madame. She was on the\r\npavement there with a little boy. I was watching them, and then I had\r\nto cut some ham for a gentleman, and I never saw them again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll wager it was Muche!\u201D cried Lisa. \u201CAh, the young scoundrel!\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, Muche who had enticed Pauline away. The little girl,\r\nwho was wearing a new blue-striped frock that day for the first time,\r\nhad been anxious to exhibit it, and had accordingly taken her stand\r\noutside the shop, manifesting great propriety of bearing, and\r\ncompressing her lips with the grave expression of a little woman of six\r\nwho is afraid of soiling her clothes. Her short and stiffly-starched\r\npetticoats stood out like the skirts of a ballet girl, allowing a full\r\nview of her tightly stretched white stockings and little sky-blue\r\nboots. Her pinafore, which hung low about her neck, was finished off at\r\nthe shoulders with an edging of embroidery, below which appeared her\r\npretty little arms, bare and rosy. She had small turquoise rings in her\r\nears, a cross at her neck, a blue velvet ribbon in her well-brushed\r\nhair; and she displayed all her mother\u2019s plumpness and softness\u2014the\r\ngracefulness, indeed, of a new doll.\r\n\r\nMuche had caught sight of her from the market, where he was amusing\r\nhimself by dropping little dead fishes into the gutter, following them\r\nalong the kerb as the water carried them away, and declaring that they\r\nwere swimming. However, the sight of Pauline standing in front of the\r\nshop and looking so smart and pretty made him cross over to her,\r\ncapless as he was, with his blouse ragged, his trousers slipping down,\r\nand his whole appearance suggestive of a seven-year-old street-arab.\r\nHis mother had certainly forbidden him to play any more with \u201Cthat fat\r\nbooby of a girl who was stuffed by her parents till she almost burst\u201D;\r\nso he stood hesitating for a moment, but at last came up to Pauline,\r\nand wanted to feel her pretty striped frock. The little girl, who had\r\nat first felt flattered, then put on a prim air and stepped back,\r\nexclaiming in a tone of displeasure: \u201CLeave me alone. Mother says I\u2019m\r\nnot to have anything to do with you.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis brought a laugh to the lips of Muche, who was a wily, enterprising\r\nyoung scamp.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a little flat you are!\u201D he retorted. \u201CWhat does it matter what\r\nyour mother says? Let\u2019s go and play at shoving each other, eh?\u201D\r\n\r\nHe doubtless nourished some wicked idea of dirtying the neat little\r\ngirl; but she, on seeing him prepare to give her a push in the back,\r\nretreated as though about to return inside the shop. Muche thereupon\r\nadopted a flattering tone like a born cajoler.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou silly! I didn\u2019t mean it,\u201D said he. \u201CHow nice you look like that!\r\nIs that little cross your mother\u2019s?\u201D\r\n\r\nPauline perked herself up, and replied that it was her own, whereupon\r\nMuche gently led her to the corner of the Rue Pirouette, touching her\r\nskirts the while and expressing his astonishment at their wonderful\r\nstiffness. All this pleased the little girl immensely. She had been\r\nvery much vexed at not receiving any notice while she was exhibiting\r\nherself outside the shop. However, in spite of all Muche\u2019s\r\nblandishments, she still refused to leave the footway.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou stupid fatty!\u201D thereupon exclaimed the youngster, relapsing into\r\ncoarseness. \u201CI\u2019ll squat you down in the gutter if you don\u2019t look out,\r\nMiss Fine-airs!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe girl was dreadfully alarmed. Muche had caught hold of her by the\r\nhand; but, recognising his mistake in policy, he again put on a\r\nwheedling air, and began to fumble in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve got a sou,\u201D said he.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the coin had a soothing effect upon Pauline. The boy held\r\nup the sou with the tips of his fingers, and the temptation to follow\r\nit proved so great that the girl at last stepped down into the roadway.\r\nMuche\u2019s diplomacy was eminently successful.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you like best?\u201D he asked.\r\n\r\nPauline gave no immediate answer. She could not make up her mind; there\r\nwere so many things that she liked. Muche, however, ran over a whole\r\nlist of dainties\u2014liquorice, molasses, gum-balls, and powdered sugar.\r\nThe powdered sugar made the girl ponder. One dipped one\u2019s fingers into\r\nit and sucked them; it was very nice. For a while she gravely\r\nconsidered the matter. Then, at last making up her mind, she said:\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, I like the mixed screws the best.\u201D\r\n\r\nMuche thereupon took hold of her arm, and she unresistingly allowed him\r\nto lead her away. They crossed the Rue Rambuteau, followed the broad\r\nfootway skirting the markets, and went as far as a grocer\u2019s shop in the\r\nRue de la Cossonnerie which was celebrated for its mixed screws. These\r\nmixed screws are small screws of paper in which grocers put up all\r\nsorts of damaged odds and ends, broken sugar-plums, fragments of\r\ncrystallised chestnuts\u2014all the doubtful residuum of their jars of\r\nsweets. Muche showed himself very gallant, allowed Pauline to choose\r\nthe screw\u2014a blue one\u2014paid his sou, and did not attempt to dispossess\r\nher of the sweets. Outside, on the footway, she emptied the\r\nmiscellaneous collection of scraps into both pockets of her pinafore;\r\nand they were such little pockets that they were quite filled. Then in\r\ndelight she began to munch the fragments one by one, wetting her\r\nfingers to catch the fine sugary dust, with such effect that she melted\r\nthe scraps of sweets, and the pockets of her pinafore soon showed two\r\nbrownish stains. Muche laughed slily to himself. He had his arm about\r\nthe girl\u2019s waist, and rumpled her frock at his ease whilst leading her\r\nround the corner of the Rue Pierre Lescot, in the direction of the\r\nPlace des Innocents.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll come and play now, won\u2019t you?\u201D he asked. \u201CThat\u2019s nice what\r\nyou\u2019ve got in your pockets, ain\u2019t it? You see that I didn\u2019t want to do\r\nyou any harm, you big silly!\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon he plunged his own fingers into her pockets, and they entered\r\nthe square together. To this spot, no doubt, he had all along intended\r\nto lure his victim. He did the honours of the square as though it were\r\nhis own private property, and indeed it was a favourite haunt of his,\r\nwhere he often larked about for whole afternoons. Pauline had never\r\nbefore strayed so far from home, and would have wept like an abducted\r\ndamsel had it not been that her pockets were full of sweets. The\r\nfountain in the middle of the flowered lawn was sending sheets of water\r\ndown its tiers of basins, whilst, between the pilasters above, Jean\r\nGoujon\u2019s nymphs, looking very white beside the dingy grey stonework,\r\ninclined their urns and displayed their nude graces in the grimy air of\r\nthe Saint Denis quarter. The two children walked round the fountain,\r\nwatching the water fall into the basins, and taking an interest in the\r\ngrass, with thoughts, no doubt, of crossing the central lawn, or\r\ngliding into the clumps of holly and rhododendrons that bordered the\r\nrailings of the square. Little Muche, however, who had now effectually\r\nrumpled the back of the pretty frock, said with his sly smile:\r\n\r\n\u201CLet\u2019s play at throwing sand at each other, eh?\u201D\r\n\r\nPauline had no will of her own left; and they began to throw the sand\r\nat each other, keeping their eyes closed meanwhile. The sand made its\r\nway in at the neck of the girl\u2019s low bodice, and trickled down into her\r\nstockings and boots. Muche was delighted to see the white pinafore\r\nbecome quite yellow. But he doubtless considered that it was still far\r\ntoo clean.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet\u2019s go and plant trees, shall we?\u201D he exclaimed suddenly. \u201CI know\r\nhow to make such pretty gardens.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, gardens!\u201D murmured Pauline full of admiration.\r\n\r\nThen, as the keeper of the square happened to be absent, Muche told her\r\nto make some holes in one of the borders; and dropping on her knees in\r\nthe middle of the soft mould, and leaning forward till she lay at full\r\nlength on her stomach, she dug her pretty little arms into the ground.\r\nHe, meantime, began to hunt for scraps of wood, and broke off branches.\r\nThese were the garden-trees which he planted in the holes that Pauline\r\nmade. He invariably complained, however, that the holes were not deep\r\nenough, and rated the girl as though she were an idle workman and he an\r\nindignant master. When she at last got up, she was black from head to\r\nfoot. Her hair was full of mould, her face was smeared with it, she\r\nlooked such a sight with her arms as black as a coalheaver\u2019s that Muche\r\nclapped his hands with glee, and exclaimed: \u201CNow we must water the\r\ntrees. They won\u2019t grow, you know, if we don\u2019t water them.\u201D\r\n\r\nThat was the finishing stroke. They went outside the square, scooped\r\nthe gutter-water up in the palms of their hands, and then ran back to\r\npour it over the bits of wood. On the way, Pauline, who was so fat that\r\nshe couldn\u2019t run properly, let the water trickle between her fingers on\r\nto her frock, so that by the time of her sixth journey she looked as if\r\nshe had been rolled in the gutter. Muche chuckled with delight on\r\nbeholding her dreadful condition. He made her sit down beside him under\r\na rhododendron near the garden they had made, and told her that the\r\ntrees were already beginning to grow. He had taken hold of her hand and\r\ncalled her his little wife.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re not sorry now that you came, are you,\u201D he asked, \u201Cinstead of\r\nmooning about on the pavement, where there was nothing to do? I know\r\nall sorts of fun we can have in the streets; you must come with me\r\nagain. You will, won\u2019t you? But you mustn\u2019t say anything to your\r\nmother, mind. If you say a word to her, I\u2019ll pull your hair the next\r\ntime I come past your shop.\u201D\r\n\r\nPauline consented to everything; and then, as a last attention, Muche\r\nfilled both pockets of her pinafore with mould. However, all the sweets\r\nwere finished, and the girl began to get uneasy, and ceased playing.\r\nMuche thereupon started pinching her, and she burst into tears, sobbing\r\nthat she wanted to go away. But at this the lad only grinned, and\r\nplayed the bully, threatening that he would not take her home at all.\r\nThen she grew terribly alarmed, and sobbed and gasped like a maiden in\r\nthe power of a libertine. Muche would certainly have ended by punching\r\nher in order to stop her row, had not a shrill voice, the voice of\r\nMademoiselle Saget, exclaimed, close by: \u201CWhy, I declare it\u2019s Pauline!\r\nLeave her alone, you wicked young scoundrel!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen the old maid took the girl by the hand, with endless expressions\r\nof amazement at the pitiful condition of her clothes. Muche showed no\r\nalarm, but followed them, chuckling to himself, and declaring that it\r\nwas Pauline who had wanted to come with him, and had tumbled down.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget was a regular frequenter of the Square des\r\nInnocents. Every afternoon she would spend a good hour there to keep\r\nherself well posted in the gossip of the common people. On either side\r\nthere is a long crescent of benches placed end to end; and on these the\r\npoor folks who stifle in the hovels of the neighbouring narrow streets\r\nassemble in crowds. There are withered, chilly-looking old women in\r\ntumbled caps, and young ones in loose jackets and carelessly fastened\r\nskirts, with bare heads and tired, faded faces, eloquent of the\r\nwretchedness of their lives. There are some men also: tidy old buffers,\r\nporters in greasy jackets, and equivocal-looking individuals in black\r\nsilk hats, while the foot-path is overrun by a swarm of youngsters\r\ndragging toy carts without wheels about, filling pails with sand, and\r\nscreaming and fighting; a dreadful crew, with ragged clothes and dirty\r\nnoses, teeming in the sunshine like vermin.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget was so slight and thin that she always managed to\r\ninsinuate herself into a place on one of the benches. She listened to\r\nwhat was being said, and started a conversation with her neighbour,\r\nsome sallow-faced workingman\u2019s wife, who sat mending linen, from time\r\nto time producing handkerchiefs and stockings riddled with holes from a\r\nlittle basket patched up with string. Moreover, Mademoiselle Saget had\r\nplenty of acquaintances here. Amidst the excruciating squalling of the\r\nchildren, and the ceaseless rumble of the traffic in the Rue Saint\r\nDenis, she took part in no end of gossip, everlasting tales about the\r\ntradesmen of the neighbourhood, the grocers, the butchers, and the\r\nbakers, enough, indeed, to fill the columns of a local paper, and the\r\nwhole envenomed by refusals of credit and covert envy, such as is\r\nalways harboured by the poor. From these wretched creatures she also\r\nobtained the most disgusting revelations, the gossip of low\r\nlodging-houses and doorkeepers\u2019 black-holes, all the filthy scandal of\r\nthe neighbourhood, which tickled her inquisitive appetite like hot\r\nspice.\r\n\r\nAs she sat with her face turned towards the markets, she had\r\nimmediately in front of her the square and its three blocks of houses,\r\ninto the windows of which her eyes tried to pry. She seemed to\r\ngradually rise and traverse the successive floors right up to the\r\ngarret skylights. She stared at the curtains; based an entire drama on\r\nthe appearance of a head between two shutters; and, by simply gazing at\r\nthe facades, ended by knowing the history of all the dwellers in these\r\nhouses. The Baratte Restaurant, with its wine shop, its gilt\r\nwrought-iron _marquise_, forming a sort of terrace whence peeped the\r\nfoliage of a few plants in flower-pots, and its four low storeys, all\r\npainted and decorated, had an especial interest for her. She gazed at\r\nits yellow columns standing out against a background of tender blue, at\r\nthe whole of its imitation temple-front daubed on the facade of a\r\ndecrepit, tumble-down house, crowned at the summit by a parapet of\r\npainted zinc. Behind the red-striped window-blinds she espied visions\r\nof nice little lunches, delicate suppers, and uproarious, unlimited\r\norgies. And she did not hesitate to invent lies about the place. It was\r\nthere, she declared, that Florent came to gorge with those two hussies,\r\nthe Mehudins, on whom he lavished his money.\r\n\r\nHowever, Pauline cried yet louder than before when the old maid took\r\nhold of her hand. Mademoiselle Saget at first led her towards the gate\r\nof the square; but before she got there she seemed to change her mind;\r\nfor she sat down at the end of a bench and tried to pacify the child.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, now, give over crying, or the policeman will lock you up,\u201D she\r\nsaid to Pauline. \u201CI\u2019ll take you home safely. You know me, don\u2019t you?\r\nI\u2019m a good friend. Come, come, let me see how prettily you can smile.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe child, however, was choking with sobs and wanted to go away.\r\nMademoiselle Saget thereupon quietly allowed her to continue weeping,\r\nreserving further remarks till she should have finished. The poor\r\nlittle creature was shivering all over; her petticoats and stockings\r\nwere wet through, and as she wiped her tears away with her dirty hands\r\nshe plastered the whole of her face with earth to the very tips of her\r\nears. When at last she became a little calmer the old maid resumed in a\r\ncaressing tone: \u201CYour mamma isn\u2019t unkind, is she? She\u2019s very fond of\r\nyou, isn\u2019t she?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes, indeed,\u201D replied Pauline, still sobbing.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd your papa, he\u2019s good to you, too, isn\u2019t he? He doesn\u2019t flog you,\r\nor quarrel with your mother, does he? What do they talk about when they\r\ngo to bed?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m asleep then.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo they talk about your cousin Florent?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget thereupon assumed a severe expression, and got up as\r\nif about to go away.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid you are a little story-teller,\u201D she said. \u201CDon\u2019t you know\r\nthat it\u2019s very wicked to tell stories? I shall go away and leave you,\r\nif you tell me lies, and then Muche will come back and pinch you.\u201D\r\n\r\nPauline began to cry again at the threat of being abandoned. \u201CBe quiet,\r\nbe quiet, you wicked little imp!\u201D cried the old maid shaking her.\r\n\u201CThere, there, now, I won\u2019t go away. I\u2019ll buy you a stick of\r\nbarley-sugar; yes, a stick of barley-sugar! So you don\u2019t love your\r\ncousin Florent, eh?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, mamma says he isn\u2019t good.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, then, so you see your mother does say something.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COne night when I was in bed with Mouton\u2014I sleep with Mouton sometimes,\r\nyou know\u2014I heard her say to father, \u2018Your brother has only escaped from\r\nthe galleys to take us all back with him there.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget gave vent to a faint cry, and sprang to her feet,\r\nquivering all over. A ray of light had just broken upon her. Then\r\nwithout a word she caught hold of Pauline\u2019s hand and made her run till\r\nthey reached the pork shop, her lips meanwhile compressed by an inward\r\nsmile, and her eyes glistening with keen delight. At the corner of the\r\nRue Pirouette, Muche, who had so far followed them, amused at seeing\r\nthe girl running along in her muddy stockings, prudently disappeared.\r\n\r\nLisa was now in a state of terrible alarm; and when she saw her\r\ndaughter so bedraggled and limp, her consternation was such that she\r\nturned the child round and round, without even thinking of beating her.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe has been with little Muche,\u201D said the old maid, in her malicious\r\nvoice. \u201CI took her away at once, and I\u2019ve brought her home. I found\r\nthem together in the square. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve been up to; but\r\nthat young vagabond is capable of anything.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa could not find a word to say; and she did not know where to take\r\nhold of her daughter, so great was her disgust at the sight of the\r\nchild\u2019s muddy boots, soiled stockings, torn skirts, and filthy face and\r\nhands. The blue velvet ribbon, the earrings, and the necklet were all\r\nconcealed beneath a crust of mud. But what put the finishing touch to\r\nLisa\u2019s exasperation was the discovery of the two pockets filled with\r\nmould. She stooped and emptied them, regardless of the pink and white\r\nflooring of the shop. And as she dragged Pauline away, she could only\r\ngasp: \u201CCome along, you filthy thing!\u201D\r\n\r\nQuite enlivened by this scene, Mademoiselle Saget now hurriedly made\r\nher way across the Rue Rambuteau. Her little feet scarcely touched the\r\nground; her joy seemed to carry her along like a breeze which fanned\r\nher with a caressing touch. She had at last found out what she had so\r\nmuch wanted to know! For nearly a year she had been consumed by\r\ncuriosity, and now at a single stroke she had gained complete power\r\nover Florent! This was unhoped-for contentment, positive salvation, for\r\nshe felt that Florent would have brought her to the tomb had she failed\r\nmuch longer in satisfying her curiosity about him. At present she was\r\ncomplete mistress of the whole neighbourhood of the markets. There was\r\nno longer any gap in her information. She could have narrated the\r\nsecret history of every street, shop by shop. And thus, as she entered\r\nthe fruit market, she fairly gasped with delight, in a perfect\r\ntransport of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\u201CHallo, Mademoiselle Saget,\u201D cried La Sarriette from her stall, \u201Cwhat\r\nare you smiling to yourself like that about? Have you won the grand\r\nprize in the lottery?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no. Ah, my dear, if you only knew!\u201D\r\n\r\nStanding there amidst her fruit, La Sarriette, in her picturesque\r\ndisarray, looked charming. Frizzy hair fell over her brow like vine\r\nbranches. Her bare arms and neck, indeed all the rosy flesh she showed,\r\nbloomed with the freshness of peach and cherry. She had playfully hung\r\nsome cherries on her ears, black cherries which dangled against her\r\ncheeks when she stooped, shaking with merry laughter. She was eating\r\ncurrants, and her merriment arose from the way in which she was\r\nsmearing her face with them. Her lips were bright red, glistening with\r\nthe juice of the fruit, as though they had been painted and perfumed\r\nwith some seraglio face-paint. A perfume of plum exhaled from her gown,\r\nwhile from the kerchief carelessly fastened across her breast came an\r\nodour of strawberries.\r\n\r\nFruits of all kinds were piled around her in her narrow stall. On the\r\nshelves at the back were rows of melons, so-called \u201Ccantaloups\u201D\r\nswarming with wart-like knots, \u201Cmaraichers\u201D whose skin was covered with\r\ngrey lace-like netting, and \u201Cculs-de-singe\u201D displaying smooth bare\r\nbumps. In front was an array of choice fruits, carefully arranged in\r\nbaskets, and showing like smooth round cheeks seeking to hide\r\nthemselves, or glimpses of sweet childish faces, half veiled by leaves.\r\nEspecially was this the case with the peaches, the blushing peaches of\r\nMontreuil, with skin as delicate and clear as that of northern maidens,\r\nand the yellow, sun-burnt peaches from the south, brown like the\r\ndamsels of Provence. The apricots, on their beds of moss, gleamed with\r\nthe hue of amber or with that sunset glow which so warmly colours the\r\nnecks of brunettes at the nape, just under the little wavy curls which\r\nfall below the chignon. The cherries, ranged one by one, resembled the\r\nshort lips of smiling Chinese girls; the Montmorencies suggested the\r\ndumpy mouths of buxom women; the English ones were longer and\r\ngraver-looking; the common black ones seemed as though they had been\r\nbruised and crushed by kisses; while the white-hearts, with their\r\npatches of rose and white, appeared to smile with mingled merriment and\r\nvexation. Then piles of apples and pears, built up with architectural\r\nsymmetry, often in pyramids, displayed the ruddy glow of budding\r\nbreasts and the gleaming sheen of shoulders, quite a show of nudity,\r\nlurking modestly behind a screen of fern-leaves. There were all sorts\r\nof varieties\u2014little red ones so tiny that they seemed to be yet in the\r\ncradle, shapeless \u201Crambours\u201D for baking, \u201Ccalvilles\u201D in light yellow\r\ngowns, sanguineous-looking \u201CCanadas,\u201D blotched \u201Cchataignier\u201D apples,\r\nfair freckled rennets and dusky russets. Then came the pears\u2014the\r\n\u201Cblanquettes,\u201D the \u201CBritish queens,\u201D the \u201CBeurres,\u201D the \u201Cmessirejeans,\u201D\r\nand the \u201Cduchesses\u201D\u2014some dumpy, some long and tapering, some with\r\nslender necks, and others with thick-set shoulders, their green and\r\nyellow bellies picked out at times with a splotch of carmine. By the\r\nside of these the transparent plums resembled tender, chlorotic\r\nvirgins; the greengages and the Orleans plums paled as with modest\r\ninnocence, while the mirabelles lay like golden beads of a rosary\r\nforgotten in a box amongst sticks of vanilla. And the strawberries\r\nexhaled a sweet perfume\u2014a perfume of youth\u2014especially those little ones\r\nwhich are gathered in the woods, and which are far more aromatic than\r\nthe large ones grown in gardens, for these breathe an insipid odour\r\nsuggestive of the watering-pot. Raspberries added their fragrance to\r\nthe pure scent. The currants\u2014red, white, and black\u2014smiled with a\r\nknowing air; whilst the heavy clusters of grapes, laden with\r\nintoxication, lay languorously at the edges of their wicker baskets,\r\nover the sides of which dangled some of the berries, scorched by the\r\nhot caresses of the voluptuous sun.\r\n\r\nIt was there that La Sarriette lived in an orchard, as it were, in an\r\natmosphere of sweet, intoxicating scents. The cheaper fruits\u2014the\r\ncherries, plums, and strawberries\u2014were piled up in front of her in\r\npaper-lined baskets, and the juice coming from their bruised ripeness\r\nstained the stall-front, and steamed, with a strong perfume, in the\r\nheat. She would feel quite giddy on those blazing July afternoons when\r\nthe melons enveloped her with a powerful, vaporous odour of musk; and\r\nthen with her loosened kerchief, fresh as she was with the springtide\r\nof life, she brought sudden temptation to all who saw her. It was\r\nshe\u2014it was her arms and necks which gave that semblance of amorous\r\nvitality to her fruit. On the stall next to her an old woman, a hideous\r\nold drunkard, displayed nothing but wrinkled apples, pears as flabby as\r\nherself, and cadaverous apricots of a witch-like sallowness. La\r\nSarriette\u2019s stall, however, spoke of love and passion. The cherries\r\nlooked like the red kisses of her bright lips; the silky peaches were\r\nnot more delicate than her neck; to the plums she seemed to have lent\r\nthe skin from her brow and chin; while some of her own crimson blood\r\ncoursed through the veins of the currants. All the scents of the avenue\r\nof flowers behind her stall were but insipid beside the aroma of\r\nvitality which exhaled from her open baskets and falling kerchief.\r\n\r\nThat day she was quite intoxicated by the scent of a large arrival of\r\nmirabelle plums, which filled the market. She could plainly see that\r\nMademoiselle Saget had learnt some great piece of news, and she wished\r\nto make her talk. But the old maid stamped impatiently whilst she\r\nrepeated: \u201CNo, no; I\u2019ve no time. I\u2019m in a great hurry to see Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur. I\u2019ve just learnt something and no mistake. You can come with\r\nme, if you like.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, she had simply gone through the fruit market for\r\nthe purpose of enticing La Sarriette to go with her. The girl could not\r\nrefuse temptation. Monsieur Jules, clean-shaven and as fresh as a\r\ncherub, was seated there, swaying to and fro on his chair.\r\n\r\n\u201CJust look after the stall for a minute, will you?\u201D La Sarriette said\r\nto him. \u201CI\u2019ll be back directly.\u201D\r\n\r\nJules, however, got up and called after her, in a thick voice: \u201CNot I;\r\nno fear! I\u2019m off! I\u2019m not going to wait an hour for you, as I did the\r\nother day. And, besides, those cursed plums of yours quite make my head\r\nache.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he calmly strolled off, with his hands in his pockets, and the\r\nstall was left to look after itself. Mademoiselle Saget went so fast\r\nthat La Sarriette had to run. In the butter pavilion a neighbour of\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur\u2019s told them that she was below in the cellar; and so,\r\nwhilst La Sarriette went down to find her, the old maid installed\r\nherself amidst the cheeses.\r\n\r\nThe cellar under the butter market is a very gloomy spot. The rows of\r\nstorerooms are protected by a very fine wire meshing, as a safeguard\r\nagainst fire; and the gas jets, which are very few and far between,\r\nglimmer like yellow splotches destitute of radiance in the heavy,\r\nmalordorous atmosphere beneath the low vault. Madame Lec\u0153ur, however,\r\nwas at work on her butter at one of the tables placed parallel with the\r\nRue Berger, and here a pale light filtered through the vent-holes. The\r\ntables, which are continually sluiced with a flood of water from the\r\ntaps, are as white as though they were quite new. With her back turned\r\nto the pump in the rear, Madame Lec\u0153ur was kneading her butter in a\r\nkind of oak box. She took some of different sorts which lay beside her,\r\nand mixed the varieties together, correcting one by another, just as is\r\ndone in the blending of wines. Bent almost double, and showing sharp,\r\nbony shoulders, and arms bared to the elbows, as scraggy and knotted as\r\npea-rods, she dug her fists into the greasy paste in front of her,\r\nwhich was assuming a whitish and chalky appearance. It was trying work,\r\nand she heaved a sigh at each fresh effort.\r\n\r\n\u201CMademoiselle Saget wants to speak to you, aunt,\u201D said La Sarriette.\r\n\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur stopped her work, and pulled her cap over her hair with\r\nher greasy fingers, seemingly quite careless of staining it. \u201CI\u2019ve\r\nnearly finished. Ask her to wait a moment,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s got something very particular to tell you,\u201D continued La\r\nSarriette.\r\n\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t be more than a minute, my dear.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she again plunged her arms into the butter, which buried them up\r\nto the elbows. Previously softened in warm water, it covered Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur\u2019s parchment-like skin as with an oily film, and threw the big\r\npurple veins that streaked her flesh into strong relief. La Sarriette\r\nwas quite disgusted by the sight of those hideous arms working so\r\nfrantically amidst the melting mass. However, she could recall the time\r\nwhen her own pretty little hands had manipulated the butter for whole\r\nafternoons at a time. It had even been a sort of almond-paste to her, a\r\ncosmetic which had kept her skin white and her nails delicately pink;\r\nand even now her slender fingers retained the suppleness it had endowed\r\nthem with.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think that butter of yours will be very good, aunt,\u201D she\r\ncontinued, after a pause. \u201CSome of the sorts seem much too strong.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m quite aware of that,\u201D replied Madame Lec\u0153ur, between a couple of\r\ngroans. \u201CBut what can I do? I must use everything up. There are some\r\nfolks who insist upon having butter cheap, and so cheap butter must be\r\nmade for them. Oh! it\u2019s always quite good enough for those who buy it.\u201D\r\n\r\nLa Sarriette reflected that she would hardly care to eat butter which\r\nhad been worked by her aunt\u2019s arms. Then she glanced at a little jar\r\nfull of a sort of reddish dye. \u201CYour colouring is too pale,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\nThis colouring-matter\u2014\u201Craucourt,\u201D as the Parisians call it is used to\r\ngive the butter a fine yellow tint. The butter women imagine that its\r\ncomposition is known only to themselves, and keep it very secret.\r\nHowever, it is merely made from anotta;[*] though a composition of\r\ncarrots and marigold is at times substituted for it.\r\n\r\n[*] Anotta, which is obtained from the pulp surrounding the seeds of\r\nthe _Bixa Orellana_, is used for a good many purposes besides the\r\ncolouring of butter and cheese. It frequently enters into the\r\ncomposition of chocolate, and is employed to dye nankeen. Police court\r\nproceedings have also shown that it is well known to the London\r\nmilkmen, who are in the habit of adding water to their merchandise.\r\n\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, do be quick!\u201D La Sarriette now exclaimed, for she was getting\r\nimpatient, and was, moreover, no longer accustomed to the malodorous\r\natmosphere of the cellar. \u201CMademoiselle Saget will be going. I fancy\r\nshe\u2019s got something very important to tell you abut my uncle Gavard.\u201D\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Madame Lec\u0153ur abruptly ceased working. She at once\r\nabandoned both butter and dye, and did not even wait to wipe her arms.\r\nWith a slight tap of her hand she settled her cap on her head again,\r\nand made her way up the steps, at her niece\u2019s heels, anxiously\r\nrepeating: \u201CDo you really think that she\u2019ll have gone away?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was reassured, however, on catching sight of Mademoiselle Saget\r\namidst the cheeses. The old maid had taken good care not to go away\r\nbefore Madame Lec\u0153ur\u2019s arrival. The three women seated themselves at\r\nthe far end of the stall, crowding closely together, and their faces\r\nalmost touching one another. Mademoiselle Saget remained silent for two\r\nlong minutes, and then, seeing that the others were burning with\r\ncuriosity, she began, in her shrill voice: \u201CYou know that Florent!\r\nWell, I can tell you now where he comes from.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor another moment she kept them in suspense; and then, in a deep,\r\nmelodramatic voice, she said: \u201CHe comes from the galleys!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe cheeses were reeking around the three women. On the two shelves at\r\nthe far end of the stall were huge masses of butter: Brittany butters\r\noverflowing from baskets; Normandy butters, wrapped in canvas, and\r\nresembling models of stomachs over which some sculptor had thrown damp\r\ncloths to keep them from drying; while other great blocks had been cut\r\ninto, fashioned into perpendicular rocky masses full of crevasses and\r\nvalleys, and resembling fallen mountain crests gilded by the pale sun\r\nof an autumn evening.\r\n\r\nBeneath the stall show-table, formed of a slab of red marble veined\r\nwith grey, baskets of eggs gleamed with a chalky whiteness; while on\r\nlayers of straw in boxes were Bondons, placed end to end, and Gournays,\r\narranged like medals, forming darker patches tinted with green. But it\r\nwas upon the table that the cheeses appeared in greatest profusion.\r\nHere, by the side of the pound-rolls of butter lying on white-beet\r\nleaves, spread a gigantic Cantal cheese, cloven here and there as by an\r\naxe; then came a golden-hued Cheshire, and next a Gruyere, resembling a\r\nwheel fallen from some barbarian chariot; whilst farther on were some\r\nDutch cheeses, suggesting decapitated heads suffused with dry blood,\r\nand having all that hardness of skulls which in France has gained them\r\nthe name of \u201Cdeath\u2019s heads.\u201D Amidst the heavy exhalations of these, a\r\nParmesan set a spicy aroma. Then there came three Brie cheeses\r\ndisplayed on round platters, and looking like melancholy extinct moons.\r\nTwo of them, very dry, were at the full; the third, in its second\r\nquarter, was melting away in a white cream, which had spread into a\r\npool and flowed over the little wooden barriers with which an attempt\r\nhad been made to arrest its course. Next came some Port Saluts, similar\r\nto antique discs, with exergues bearing their makers\u2019 names in print. A\r\nRomantour, in its tin-foil wrapper, suggested a bar of nougat or some\r\nsweet cheese astray amidst all these pungent, fermenting curds. The\r\nRoqueforts under their glass covers also had a princely air, their fat\r\nfaces marbled with blue and yellow, as though they were suffering from\r\nsome unpleasant malady such as attacks the wealthy gluttons who eat too\r\nmany truffles. And on a dish by the side of these, the hard grey goats\u2019\r\nmilk cheeses, about the size of a child\u2019s fist, resembled the pebbles\r\nwhich the billy-goats send rolling down the stony paths as they clamber\r\nalong ahead of their flocks. Next came the strong smelling cheeses: the\r\nMont d\u2019Ors, of a bright yellow hue, and exhaling a comparatively mild\r\nodour; the Troyes, very thick, and bruised at the edges, and of a far\r\nmore pungent smell, recalling the dampness of a cellar; the Camemberts,\r\nsuggestive of high game; the square Neufchatels, Limbourgs, Marolles,\r\nand Pont l\u2019Eveques, each adding its own particular sharp scent to the\r\nmalodorous bouquet, till it became perfectly pestilential; the\r\nLivarots, ruddy in hue, and as irritating to the throat as sulphur\r\nfumes; and, lastly, stronger than all the others, the Olivets, wrapped\r\nin walnut leaves, like the carrion which peasants cover with branches\r\nas it lies rotting in the hedgerow under the blazing sun.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the afternoon had softened the cheeses; the patches of\r\nmould on their crusts were melting, and glistening with tints of ruddy\r\nbronze and verdigris. Beneath their cover of leaves, the skins of the\r\nOlivets seemed to be heaving as with the slow, deep respiration of a\r\nsleeping man. A Livarot was swarming with life; and in a fragile box\r\nbehind the scales a Gerome flavoured with aniseed diffused such a\r\npestilential smell that all around it the very flies had fallen\r\nlifeless on the gray-veined slap of ruddy marble.\r\n\r\nThis Gerome was almost immediately under Mademoiselle Saget\u2019s nose; so\r\nshe drew back, and leaned her head against the big sheets of white and\r\nyellow paper which were hanging in a corner.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D she repeated, with an expression of disgust, \u201Che comes from the\r\ngalleys! Ah, those Quenu-Gradelles have no reason to put on so many\r\nairs!\u201D\r\n\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur and La Sarriette, however, had burst into exclamations of\r\nastonishment: \u201CIt wasn\u2019t possible, surely! What had he done to be sent\r\nto the galleys? Could anyone, now, have ever suspected that Madame\r\nQuenu, whose virtue was the pride of the whole neighbourhood, would\r\nchoose a convict for a lover?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, but you don\u2019t understand at all!\u201D cried the old maid impatiently.\r\n\u201CJust listen, now, while I explain things. I was quite certain that I\r\nhad seen that great lanky fellow somewhere before.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she proceeded to tell them Florent\u2019s story. She had recalled to\r\nmind a vague report which had circulated of a nephew of old Gradelle\r\nbeing transported to Cayenne for murdering six gendarmes at a\r\nbarricade. She had even seen this nephew on one occasion in the Rue\r\nPirouette. The pretended cousin was undoubtedly the same man. Then she\r\nbegan to bemoan her waning powers. Her memory was quite going, she\r\nsaid; she would soon be unable to remember anything. And she bewailed\r\nher perishing memory as bitterly as any learned man might bewail the\r\nloss of his notes representing the work of a life-time, on seeing them\r\nswept away by a gust of wind.\r\n\r\n\u201CSix gendarmes!\u201D murmured La Sarriette, admiringly; \u201Che must have a\r\nvery heavy fist!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd he\u2019s made away with plenty of others, as well,\u201D added Mademoiselle\r\nSaget. \u201CI shouldn\u2019t advise you to meet him at night!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a villain!\u201D stammered out Madame Lec\u0153ur, quite terrified.\r\n\r\nThe slanting beams of the sinking sun were now enfilading the pavilion,\r\nand the odour of the cheeses became stronger than ever. That of the\r\nMarolles seemed to predominate, borne hither and thither in powerful\r\nwhiffs. Then, however, the wind appeared to change, and suddenly the\r\nemanations of the Limbourgs were wafted towards the three women,\r\npungent and bitter, like the last gasps of a dying man.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut in that case,\u201D resumed Madame Lec\u0153ur, \u201Che must be fat Lisa\u2019s\r\nbrother-in-law. And we thought that he was her lover!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe women exchanged glances. This aspect of the case took them by\r\nsurprise. They were loth to give up their first theory. However, La\r\nSarriette, turning to Mademoiselle Saget, remarked: \u201CThat must have\r\nbeen all wrong. Besides, you yourself say that he\u2019s always running\r\nafter the two Mehudin girls.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly he is,\u201D exclaimed Mademoiselle Saget sharply, fancying that\r\nher word was doubted. \u201CHe dangles about them every evening. But, after\r\nall, it\u2019s no concern of ours, is it? We are virtuous women, and what he\r\ndoes makes no difference to us, the horrid scoundrel!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, certainly not,\u201D agreed the other two. \u201CHe\u2019s a consummate villain.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe affair was becoming tragical. Of course beautiful Lisa was now out\r\nof the question, but for this they found ample consolation in\r\nprophesying that Florent would bring about some frightful catastrophe.\r\nIt was quite clear, they said, that he had got some base design in his\r\nhead. When people like him escaped from gaol it was only to burn\r\neverything down; and if he had come to the markets it must assuredly be\r\nfor some abominable purpose. Then they began to indulge in the wildest\r\nsuppositions. The two dealers declared that they would put additional\r\npadlocks to the doors of their storerooms; and La Sarriette called to\r\nmind that a basket of peaches had been stolen from her during the\r\nprevious week. Mademoiselle Saget, however, quite frightened the two\r\nothers by informing them that that was not the way in which the Reds\r\nbehaved; they despised such trifles as baskets of peaches; their plan\r\nwas to band themselves together in companies of two or three hundred,\r\nkill everybody they came across, and then plunder and pillage at their\r\nease. That was \u201Cpolitics,\u201D she said, with the superior air of one who\r\nknew what she was talking about. Madame Lec\u0153ur felt quite ill. She\r\nalready saw Florent and his accomplices hiding in the cellars, and\r\nrushing out during the night to set the markets in flames and sack\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! by the way,\u201D suddenly exclaimed the old maid, \u201Cnow I think of it,\r\nthere\u2019s all that money of old Gradelle\u2019s! Dear me, dear me, those\r\nQuenus can\u2019t be at all at their ease!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe now looked quite gay again. The conversation took a fresh turn, and\r\nthe others fell foul of the Quenus when Mademoiselle Saget had told\r\nthem the history of the treasure discovered in the salting-tub, with\r\nevery particular of which she was acquainted. She was even able to\r\ninform them of the exact amount of the money found\u2014eighty-five thousand\r\nfrancs\u2014though neither Lisa nor Quenu was aware of having revealed this\r\nto a living soul. However, it was clear that the Quenus had not given\r\nthe great lanky fellow his share. He was too shabbily dressed for that.\r\nPerhaps he had never even heard of the discovery of the treasure.\r\nPlainly enough, they were all thieves in his family. Then the three\r\nwomen bent their heads together and spoke in lower tones. They were\r\nunanimously of opinion that it might perhaps be dangerous to attack the\r\nbeautiful Lisa, but it was decidedly necessary that they should settle\r\nthe Red Republican\u2019s hash, so that he might no longer prey upon the\r\npurse of poor Monsieur Gavard.\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Gavard there came a pause. The gossips looked at each\r\nother with a circumspect air. And then, as they drew breath, they\r\ninhaled the odour of the Camemberts, whose gamy scent had overpowered\r\nthe less penetrating emanations of the Marolles and the Limbourgs, and\r\nspread around with remarkable power. Every now and then, however, a\r\nslight whiff, a flutelike note, came from the Parmesan, while the Bries\r\ncontributed a soft, musty scent, the gentle, insipid sound, as it were,\r\nof damp tambourines. Next followed an overpowering refrain from the\r\nLivarots, and afterwards the Gerome, flavoured with aniseed, kept up\r\nthe symphony with a high prolonged note, like that of a vocalist during\r\na pause in the accompaniment.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have seen Madame Leonce,\u201D Mademoiselle Saget at last continued, with\r\na significant expression.\r\n\r\nAt this the two others became extremely attentive. Madame Leonce was\r\nthe doorkeeper of the house where Gavard lived in the Rue de la\r\nCossonnerie. It was an old house standing back, with its ground floor\r\noccupied by an importer of oranges and lemons, who had had the frontage\r\ncoloured blue as high as the first floor. Madame Leonce acted as\r\nGavard\u2019s housekeeper, kept the keys of his cupboards and closets, and\r\nbrought him up tisane when he happened to catch cold. She was a\r\nsevere-looking woman, between fifty and sixty years of age, and spoke\r\nslowly, but at endless length. Mademoiselle Saget, who went to drink\r\ncoffee with her every Wednesday evening, had cultivated her friendship\r\nmore closely than ever since the poultry dealer had gone to lodge in\r\nthe house. They would talk about the worthy man for hours at a time.\r\nThey both professed the greatest affection for him, and a keen desire\r\nto ensure his comfort and happiness.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I have seen Madame Leonce,\u201D repeated the old maid. \u201CWe had a cup\r\nof coffee together last night. She was greatly worried. It seems that\r\nMonsieur Gavard never comes home now before one o\u2019clock in the morning.\r\nLast Sunday she took him up some broth, as she thought he looked quite\r\nill.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, she knows very well what she\u2019s about,\u201D exclaimed Madame Lec\u0153ur,\r\nwhom these attentions to Gavard somewhat alarmed.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget felt bound to defend her friend. \u201COh, really, you\r\nare quite mistaken,\u201D said she. \u201CMadame Leonce is much above her\r\nposition; she is quite a lady. If she wanted to enrich herself at\r\nMonsieur Gavard\u2019s expense, she might easily have done so long ago. It\r\nseems that he leaves everything lying about in the most careless\r\nfashion. It\u2019s about that, indeed, that I want to speak to you. But\r\nyou\u2019ll not repeat anything I say, will you? I am telling it you in\r\nstrict confidence.\u201D\r\n\r\nBoth the others swore that they would never breathe a word of what they\r\nmight hear; and they craned out their necks with eager curiosity,\r\nwhilst the old maid solemnly resumed: \u201CWell, then, Monsieur Gavard has\r\nbeen behaving very strangely of late. He has been buying firearms\u2014a\r\ngreat big pistol\u2014one of those which revolve, you know. Madame Leonce\r\nsays that things are awful, for this pistol is always lying about on\r\nthe table or the mantelpiece; and she daren\u2019t dust anywhere near it.\r\nBut that isn\u2019t all. His money\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHis money!\u201D echoed Madame Lec\u0153ur, with blazing cheeks.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, he\u2019s disposed of all his stocks and shares. He\u2019s sold\r\neverything, and keeps a great heap of gold in a cupboard.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA heap of gold!\u201D exclaimed La Sarriette in ecstasy.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, a great heap of gold. It covers a whole shelf, and is quite\r\ndazzling. Madame Leonce told me that one morning Gavard opened the\r\ncupboard in her presence, and that the money quite blinded her, it\r\nshone so.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. The eyes of the three women were blinking as\r\nthough the dazzling pile of gold was before them. Presently La\r\nSarriette began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a jolly time I would have with Jules if my uncle would give that\r\nmoney to me!\u201D said she.\r\n\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur, however, seemed quite overwhelmed by this revelation,\r\ncrushed beneath the weight of the gold which she could not banish from\r\nher sight. Covetous envy thrilled her. But at last, raising her skinny\r\narms and shrivelled hands, her finger-nails still stuffed with butter,\r\nshe stammered in a voice full of bitter distress: \u201COh, I mustn\u2019t think\r\nof it! It\u2019s too dreadful!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, it would all be yours, you know, if anything were to happen to\r\nMonsieur Gavard,\u201D retorted Mademoiselle Saget. \u201CIf I were in your\r\nplace, I would look after my interests. That revolver means nothing\r\ngood, you may depend upon it. Monsieur Gavard has got into the hands of\r\nevil counsellors; and I\u2019m afraid it will all end badly.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen the conversation again turned upon Florent. The three women\r\nassailed him more violently than ever. And afterwards, with perfect\r\ncomposure, they began to discuss what would be the result of all these\r\ndark goings-on so far as he and Gavard were concerned; certainly it\r\nwould be no pleasant one if there was any gossiping. And thereupon they\r\nswore that they themselves would never repeat a word of what they knew;\r\nnot, however, because that scoundrel Florent merited any consideration,\r\nbut because it was necessary, at all costs, to save that worthy\r\nMonsieur Gavard from being compromised. Then they rose from their\r\nseats, and Mademoiselle Saget was burning as if to go away when the\r\nbutter dealer asked her: \u201CAll the same, in case of accident, do you\r\nthink that Madame Leonce can be trusted? I dare say she has the key of\r\nthe cupboard.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, that\u2019s more than I can tell you,\u201D replied the old maid. \u201CI\r\nbelieve she\u2019s a very honest woman; but, after all, there\u2019s no telling.\r\nThere are circumstances, you know, which tempt the best of people.\r\nAnyhow, I\u2019ve warned you both; and you must do what you think proper.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs the three women stood there, taking leave of each other, the odour\r\nof the cheeses seemed to become more pestilential than ever. It was a\r\ncacophony of smells, ranging from the heavily oppressive odour of the\r\nDutch cheeses and the Gruyeres to the alkaline pungency of the Olivets.\r\nFrom the Cantal, the Cheshire, and the goats\u2019 milk cheeses there seemed\r\nto come a deep breath like the sound of a bassoon, amidst which the\r\nsharp, sudden whiffs of the Neufchatels, the Troyes, and the Mont d\u2019Ors\r\ncontributed short, detached notes. And then the different odours\r\nappeared to mingle one with another, the reek of the Limbourgs, the\r\nPort Saluts, the Geromes, the Marolles, the Livarots, and the Pont\r\nl\u2019Eveques uniting in one general, overpowering stench sufficient to\r\nprovoke asphyxia. And yet it almost seemed as though it were not the\r\ncheeses but the vile words of Madame Lec\u0153ur and Mademoiselle Saget that\r\ndiffused this awful odour.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m very much obliged to you, indeed I am,\u201D said the butter dealer.\r\n\u201CIf ever I get rich, you shall not find yourself forgotten.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe old maid still lingered in the stall. Taking up a Bondon, she\r\nturned it round, and put it down on the slab again. Then she asked its\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\u201CTo me!\u201D she added, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, nothing to you,\u201D replied Madame Lec\u0153ur. \u201CI\u2019ll make you a present\r\nof it.\u201D And again she exclaimed: \u201CAh, if I were only rich!\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget thereupon told her that some day or other she would\r\nbe rich. The Bondon had already disappeared within the old maid\u2019s bag.\r\nAnd now the butter dealer returned to the cellar, while Mademoiselle\r\nSaget escorted La Sarriette back to her stall. On reaching it they\r\ntalked for a moment or two about Monsieur Jules. The fruits around them\r\ndiffused a fresh scent of summer.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt smells much nicer here than at your aunt\u2019s,\u201D said the old maid. \u201CI\r\nfelt quite ill a little time ago. I can\u2019t think how she manages to\r\nexist there. But here it\u2019s very sweet and pleasant. It makes you look\r\nquite rosy, my dear.\u201D\r\n\r\nLa Sarriette began to laugh, for she was fond of compliments. Then she\r\nserved a lady with a pound of mirabelle plums, telling her that they\r\nwere as sweet as sugar.\r\n\r\n\u201CI should like to buy some of those mirabelles too,\u201D murmured\r\nMademoiselle Saget, when the lady had gone away; \u201Conly I want so few. A\r\nlone woman, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTake a handful of them,\u201D exclaimed the pretty brunette. \u201CThat won\u2019t\r\nruin me. Send Jules back to me if you see him, will you? You\u2019ll most\r\nlikely find him smoking his cigar on the first bench to the right as\r\nyou turn out of the covered way.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget distended her fingers as widely as possible in order\r\nto take a handful of mirabelles, which joined the Bondon in the bag.\r\nThen she pretended to leave the market, but in reality made a detour by\r\none of the covered ways, thinking, as she walked slowly along, that the\r\nmirabelles and Bondon would not make a very substantial dinner. When\r\nshe was unable, during her afternoon perambulations, to wheedle\r\nstallkeepers into filling her bag for her, she was reduced to dining\r\noff the merest scraps. So she now slyly made her way back to the butter\r\npavilions, where, on the side of the Rue Berger, at the back of the\r\noffices of the oyster salesmen, there were some stalls at which cooked\r\nmeat was sold. Every morning little closed box-like carts, lined with\r\nzinc and furnished with ventilators, drew up in front of the larger\r\nParisian kitchens and carried away the leavings of the restaurants, the\r\nembassies, and State Ministries. These leavings were conveyed to the\r\nmarket cellars and there sorted. By nine o\u2019clock plates of food were\r\ndisplayed for sale at prices ranging from three to five sous, their\r\ncontents comprising slices of meat, scraps of game, heads and tails of\r\nfishes, bits of galantine, stray vegetables, and, by way of dessert,\r\ncakes scarcely cut into, and other confectionery. Poor starving\r\nwretches, scantily-paid clerks, and women shivering with fever were to\r\nbe seen crowding around, and the street lads occasionally amused\r\nthemselves by hooting the pale-faced individuals, known to be misers,\r\nwho only made their purchases after slyly glancing about them to see\r\nthat they were not observed.[*] Mademoiselle Saget wriggled her way to\r\na stall, the keeper of which boasted that the scraps she sold came\r\nexclusively from the Tuileries. One day, indeed, she had induced the\r\nold maid to buy a slice of leg of mutton by informing that it had come\r\nfrom the plate of the Emperor himself; and this slice of mutton, eaten\r\nwith no little pride, had been a soothing consolation to Mademoiselle\r\nSaget\u2019s vanity. The wariness of her approach to the stall was,\r\nmoreover, solely caused by her desire to keep well with the\r\nneighbouring shop people, whose premises she was eternally haunting\r\nwithout ever buying anything. Her usual tactics were to quarrel with\r\nthem as soon as she had managed to learn their histories, when she\r\nwould bestow her patronage upon a fresh set, desert it in due course,\r\nand then gradually make friends again with those with whom she had\r\nquarrelled. In this way she made the complete circuit of the market\r\nneighbourhood, ferreting about in every shop and stall. Anyone would\r\nhave imagined that she consumed an enormous amount of provisions,\r\nwhereas, in point of fact, she lived solely upon presents and the few\r\nscraps which she was compelled to buy when people were not in the\r\ngiving vein.\r\n\r\n[*] The dealers in these scraps are called _bijoutiers_, or jewellers,\r\nwhilst the scraps themselves are known as _harlequins_, the idea being\r\nthat they are of all colours and shapes when mingled together, thus\r\nsuggesting harlequin\u2019s variegated attire.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that particular evening there was only a tall old man standing in\r\nfront of the stall. He was sniffing at a plate containing a mixture of\r\nmeat and fish. Mademoiselle Saget, in her turn, began to sniff at a\r\nplate of cold fried fish. The price of it was three sous, but, by dint\r\nof bargaining, she got it for two. The cold fish then vanished into the\r\nbag. Other customers now arrived, and with a uniform impulse lowered\r\ntheir noses over the plates. The smell of the stall was very\r\ndisgusting, suggestive alike of greasy dishes and a dirty sink.[*]\r\n\r\n[*] Particulars of the strange and repulsive trade in harlequins, which\r\neven nowadays is not extinct, will be found in Privat d\u2019Anglemont\u2019s\r\nwell-known book _Paris Anecdote_, written at the very period with which\r\nM. Zola deals in the present work. My father, Henry Vizetelly, also\r\ngave some account of it in his _Glances Back through Seventy Years_, in\r\na chapter describing the odd ways in which certain Parisians contrive\r\nto get a living.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CCome and see me to-morrow,\u201D the stallkeeper called out to the old\r\nmaid, \u201Cand I\u2019ll put something nice on one side for you. There\u2019s going\r\nto be a grand dinner at the Tuileries to-night.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget was just promising to come, when, happening to turn\r\nround, she discovered Gavard looking at her and listening to what she\r\nwas saying. She turned very red, and, contracting her skinny shoulders,\r\nhurried away, affecting not to recognise him. Gavard, however, followed\r\nher for a few yards, shrugging his shoulders and muttering to himself\r\nthat he was no longer surprised at the old shrew\u2019s malice, now he knew\r\nthat \u201Cshe poisoned herself with the filth carted away from the\r\nTuileries.\u201D\r\n\r\nOn the very next morning vague rumours began to circulate in the\r\nmarkets. Madame Lec\u0153ur and La Sarriette were in their own fashion\r\nkeeping the oaths of silence they had taken. For her own part,\r\nMademoiselle Saget warily held her tongue, leaving the two others to\r\ncirculate the story of Florent\u2019s antecedents. At first only a few\r\nmeagre details were hawked about in low tones; then various versions of\r\nthe facts got into circulation, incidents were exaggerated, and\r\ngradually quite a legend was constructed, in which Florent played the\r\npart of a perfect bogey man. He had killed ten gendarmes at the\r\nbarricade in the Rue Greneta, said some; he had returned to France on a\r\npirate ship whose crew scoured the seas to murder everyone they came\r\nacross, said others; whilst a third set declared that ever since his\r\narrival he had been observed prowling about at nighttime with\r\nsuspicious-looking characters, of whom he was undoubtedly the leader.\r\nSoon the imaginative market women indulged in the highest flights of\r\nfancy, revelled in the most melodramatic ideas. There was talk of a\r\nband of smugglers plying their nefarious calling in the very heart of\r\nParis, and of a vast central association formed for systematically\r\nrobbing the stalls in the markets. Much pity was expressed for the\r\nQuenu-Gradelles, mingled with malicious allusions to their uncle\u2019s\r\nfortune. That fortune was an endless subject of discussion. The general\r\nopinion was that Florent had returned to claim his share of the\r\ntreasure; however, as no good reason was forthcoming to explain why the\r\ndivision had not taken place already, it was asserted that Florent was\r\nwaiting for some opportunity which might enable him to pocket the whole\r\namount. The Quenu-Gradelles would certainly be found murdered some\r\nmorning, it was said; and a rumour spread that dreadful quarrels\r\nalready took place every night between the two brothers and beautiful\r\nLisa.\r\n\r\nWhen these stories reached the ears of the beautiful Norman, she\r\nshrugged her shoulders and burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201CGet away with you!\u201D she cried, \u201Cyou don\u2019t know him. Why, the dear\r\nfellow\u2019s as gentle as a lamb.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe had recently refused the hand of Monsieur Lebigre, who had at last\r\nventured upon a formal proposal. For two months past he had given the\r\nMehudins a bottle of some liqueur every Sunday. It was Rose who brought\r\nit, and she was always charged with a compliment for La Normande, some\r\npretty speech which she faithfully repeated, without appearing in the\r\nslightest degree embarrassed by the peculiar commission. When Monsieur\r\nLebigre was rejected, he did not pine, but to show that he took no\r\noffence and was still hopeful, he sent Rose on the following Sunday\r\nwith two bottles of champagne and a large bunch of flowers. She gave\r\nthem into the handsome fish-girl\u2019s own hands, repeating, as she did so,\r\nthe wine dealer\u2019s prose madrigal:\r\n\r\n\u201CMonsieur Lebigre begs you to drink this to his health, which has been\r\ngreatly shaken by you know what. He hopes that you will one day be\r\nwilling to cure him, by being for him as pretty and as sweet as these\r\nflowers.\u201D\r\n\r\nLa Normande was much amused by the servant\u2019s delighted air. She kissed\r\nher as she spoke to her of her master, and asked her if he wore braces,\r\nand snored at nights. Then she made her take the champagne and flowers\r\nback with her. \u201CTell Monsieur Lebigre,\u201D said she, \u201Cthat he\u2019s not to\r\nsend you here again. It quite vexes me to see you coming here so\r\nmeekly, with your bottles under your arms.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, he wishes me to come,\u201D replied Rose, as she went away. \u201CIt is\r\nwrong of you to distress him. He is a very handsome man.\u201D\r\n\r\nLa Normande, however, was quite conquered by Florent\u2019s affectionate\r\nnature. She continued to follow Muche\u2019s lessons of an evening in the\r\nlamplight, indulging the while in a dream of marrying this man who was\r\nso kind to children. She would still keep her fish stall, while he\r\nwould doubtless rise to a position of importance in the administrative\r\nstaff of the markets. This dream of hers, however, was scarcely\r\nfurthered by the tutor\u2019s respectful bearing towards her. He bowed to\r\nher, and kept himself at a distance, when she have liked to laugh with\r\nhim, and love him as she knew how to love. But it was just this covert\r\nresistance on Florent\u2019s part which continually brought her back to the\r\ndream of marrying him. She realised that he lived in a loftier sphere\r\nthan her own; and by becoming his wife she imagined that her vanity\r\nwould reap no little satisfaction.\r\n\r\nShe was greatly surprised when she learned the history of the man she\r\nloved. He had never mentioned a word of those things to her; and she\r\nscolded him about it. His extraordinary adventures only increased her\r\ntenderness for him, and for evenings together she made him relate all\r\nthat had befallen him. She trembled with fear lest the police should\r\ndiscover him; but he reassured her, saying that the matter was now too\r\nold for the police to trouble their heads about it. One evening he told\r\nher of the woman on the Boulevard Montmartre, the woman in the pink\r\nbonnet, whose blood had dyed his hands. He still frequently thought of\r\nthat poor creature. His anguish-stricken mind had often dwelt upon her\r\nduring the clear nights he had passed in Cayenne; and he had returned\r\nto France with a wild dream of meeting her again on some footway in the\r\nbright sunshine, even though he could still feel her corpse-like weight\r\nacross his legs. And yet, he thought, she might perhaps have recovered.\r\nAt times he received quite a shock while he was walking through the\r\nstreets, on fancying that he recognised her; and he followed pink\r\nbonnets and shawl-draped shoulders with a wildly beating heart. When he\r\nclosed his eyes he could see her walking, and advancing towards him;\r\nbut she let her shawl slip down, showing the two red stains on her\r\nchemisette; and then he saw that her face was pale as wax, and that her\r\neyes were blank, and her lips distorted by pain. For a long time he\r\nsuffered from not knowing her name, from being forced to look upon her\r\nas a mere shadow, whose recollection filled him with sorrow. Whenever\r\nany idea of woman crossed his mind it was always she that rose up\r\nbefore him, as the one pure, tender wife. He often found himself\r\nfancying that she might be looking for him on that boulevard where she\r\nhad fallen dead, and that if she had met him a few seconds sooner she\r\nwould have given him a life of joy. And he wished for no other wife;\r\nnone other existed for him. When he spoke of her, his voice trembled to\r\nsuch a degree that La Normande, her wits quickened by her love, guessed\r\nhis secret, and felt jealous.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, it\u2019s really much better that you shouldn\u2019t see her again,\u201D she\r\nsaid maliciously. \u201CShe can\u2019t look particularly nice by this time.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent turned pale with horror at the vision which these words evoked.\r\nHis love was rotting in her grave. He could not forgive La Normande\u2019s\r\nsavage cruelty, which henceforth made him see the grinning jaws and\r\nhollow eyes of a skeleton within that lovely pink bonnet. Whenever the\r\nfish-girl tried to joke with him on the subject he turned quite angry,\r\nand silenced her with almost coarse language.\r\n\r\nThat, however, which especially surprised the beautiful Norman in these\r\nrevelations was the discovery that she had been quite mistaken in\r\nsupposing that she was enticing a lover away from handsome Lisa. This\r\nso diminished her feeling of triumph, that for a week or so her love\r\nfor Florent abated. She consoled herself, however, with the story of\r\nthe inheritance, no longer calling Lisa a strait-laced prude, but a\r\nthief who kept back her brother-in-law\u2019s money, and assumed\r\nsanctimonious airs to deceive people. Every evening, while Muche took\r\nhis writing lesson, the conversation turned upon old Gradelle\u2019s\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid anyone ever hear of such an idea?\u201D the fish-girl would exclaim,\r\nwith a laugh. \u201CDid the old man want to salt his money, since he put it\r\nin a salting-tub? Eighty-five thousand francs! That\u2019s a nice sum of\r\nmoney! And, besides, the Quenus, no doubt, lied about it\u2014there was\r\nperhaps two or three times as much. Ah, if I were in your place, I\r\nshouldn\u2019t lose any time about claiming my share; indeed I shouldn\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve no need of anything,\u201D was Florent\u2019s invariable answer. \u201CI\r\nshouldn\u2019t know what to do with the money if I had it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, you\u2019re no man!\u201D cried La Normande, losing all control over\r\nherself. \u201CIt\u2019s pitiful! Can\u2019t you see that the Quenus are laughing at\r\nyou? That great fat thing passes all her husband\u2019s old clothes over to\r\nyou. I\u2019m not saying this to hurt your feelings, but everybody makes\r\nremarks about it. Why, the whole neighbourhood has seen the greasy pair\r\nof trousers, which you\u2019re now wearing, on your brother\u2019s legs for three\r\nyears and more! If I were in your place I\u2019d throw their dirty rags in\r\ntheir faces, and insist upon my rights. Your share comes to forty-two\r\nthousand five hundred francs, doesn\u2019t it? Well, I shouldn\u2019t go out of\r\nthe place till I\u2019d got forty-two thousand five hundred francs.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was useless for Florent to explain to her that his sister-in-law had\r\noffered to pay him his share, that she was taking care of it for him,\r\nand that it was he himself who had refused to receive it. He entered\r\ninto the most minute particulars, seeking to convince her of the\r\nQuenus\u2019 honesty, but she sarcastically replied: \u201COh, yes, I dare say! I\r\nknow all about their honesty. That fat thing folds it up every morning\r\nand puts it away in her wardrobe for fear it should get soiled. Really,\r\nI quite pity you, my poor friend. It\u2019s easy to gull you, for you can\u2019t\r\nsee any further than a child of five. One of these days she\u2019ll simply\r\nput your money in her pocket, and you\u2019ll never look on it again. Shall\r\nI go, now, and claim your share for you, just to see what she says?\r\nThere\u2019d be some fine fun, I can tell you! I\u2019d either have the money, or\r\nI\u2019d break everything in the house\u2014I swear I would!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, it\u2019s no business of yours,\u201D Florent replied, quite alarmed.\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll see about it; I may possibly be wanting some money soon.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this La Normande assumed an air of doubt, shrugged her shoulders,\r\nand told him that he was really too chicken-hearted. Her one great aim\r\nnow was to embroil him with the Quenu-Gradelles, and she employed every\r\nmeans she could think of to effect her purpose, both anger and banter,\r\nas well as affectionate tenderness. She also cherished another design.\r\nWhen she had succeeded in marrying Florent, she would go and administer\r\na sound cuffing to beautiful Lisa, if the latter did not yield up the\r\nmoney. As she lay awake in her bed at night she pictured every detail\r\nof the scene. She saw herself sitting down in the middle of the pork\r\nshop in the busiest part of the day, and making a terrible fuss. She\r\nbrooded over this idea to such an extent, it obtained such a hold upon\r\nher, that she would have been willing to marry Florent simply in order\r\nto be able to go and demand old Gradelle\u2019s forty-two thousand five\r\nhundred francs.\r\n\r\nOld Madame Mehudin, exasperated by La Normande\u2019s dismissal of Monsieur\r\nLebigre, proclaimed everywhere that her daughter was mad, and that the\r\n\u201Clong spindle-shanks\u201D must have administered some insidious drug to\r\nher. When she learned the Cayenne story, her anger was terrible. She\r\ncalled Florent a convict and murderer, and said it was no wonder that\r\nhis villainy had kept him lank and flat. Her versions of Florent\u2019s\r\nbiography were the most horrible of all that were circulated in the\r\nneighbourhood. At home she kept a moderately quiet tongue in her head,\r\nand restricted herself to muttered indignation, and a show of locking\r\nup the drawer where the silver was kept whenever Florent arrived. One\r\nday, however, after a quarrel with her elder daughter, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\u201CThings can\u2019t go on much longer like this! It is that vile man who is\r\nsetting you against me. Take care that you don\u2019t try me too far, or\r\nI\u2019ll go and denounce him to the police. I will, as true as I stand\r\nhere!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll denounce him!\u201D echoed La Normande, trembling violently, and\r\nclenching her fists. \u201CYou\u2019d better not! Ah, if you weren\u2019t my mother\u2014\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this, Claire, who was a spectator of the quarrel, began to laugh,\r\nwith a nervous laughter that seemed to rasp her throat. For some time\r\npast she had been gloomier and more erratic than ever, invariably\r\nshowing red eyes and a pale face.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, what would you do?\u201D she asked. \u201CWould you give her a cuffing?\r\nPerhaps you\u2019d like to give me, your sister, one as well? I dare say it\r\nwill end in that. But I\u2019ll clear the house of him. I\u2019ll go to the\r\npolice to save mother the trouble.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as La Normande almost choked with the angry threats that rose to\r\nher throat, the younger girl added: \u201CI\u2019ll spare you the exertion of\r\nbeating me. I\u2019ll throw myself into the river as I come back over the\r\nbridge.\u201D\r\n\r\nBig tears were streaming from her eyes; and she rushed off to her\r\nbedroom, banging the doors violently behind her. Old Madame Mehudin\r\nsaid nothing more about denouncing Florent. Muche, however, told La\r\nNormande that he met his grandma talking with Monsieur Lebigre in every\r\ncorner of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between the beautiful Norman and the beautiful Lisa now\r\nassumed a less aggressive but more disturbing character. In the\r\nafternoon, when the red-striped canvas awning was drawn down in front\r\nof the pork shop, the fish-girl would remark that the big fat thing\r\nfelt afraid, and was concealing herself. She was also much exasperated\r\nby the occasional lowering of the window-blind, on which was pictured a\r\nhunting-breakfast in a forest glade, with ladies and gentlemen in\r\nevening dress partaking of a red pasty, as big as themselves, on the\r\nyellow grass.\r\n\r\nBeautiful Lisa, however, was by no means afraid. As soon as the sun\r\nbegan to sink she drew up the blind; and, as she sat knitting behind\r\nher counter, she serenely scanned the market square, where numerous\r\nurchins were poking about in the soil under the gratings which\r\nprotected the roots of the plane-trees, while porters smoked their\r\npipes on the benches along the footway, at either end of which was an\r\nadvertisement column covered with theatrical posters, alternately\r\ngreen, yellow, red, and blue, like some harlequin\u2019s costume. And while\r\npretending to watch the passing vehicles, Lisa would really be\r\nscrutinising the beautiful Norman. She might occasionally be seen\r\nbending forward, as though her eyes were following the Bastille and\r\nPlace Wagram omnibus to the Pointe Saint Eustache, where it always\r\nstopped for a time. But this was only a manoeuvre to enable her to get\r\na better view of the fish-girl, who, as a set-off against the blind,\r\nretorted by covering her head and fish with large sheets of brown\r\npaper, on the pretext of warding off the rays of the setting sun. The\r\nadvantage at present was on Lisa\u2019s side, for as the time for striking\r\nthe decisive blow approached she manifested the calmest serenity of\r\nbearing, whereas her rival, in spite of all her efforts to attain the\r\nsame air of distinction, always lapsed into some piece of gross\r\nvulgarity, which she afterwards regretted. La Normande\u2019s ambition was\r\nto look \u201Clike a lady.\u201D Nothing irritated her more than to hear people\r\nextolling the good manners of her rival. This weak point of hers had\r\nnot escaped old Madame Mehudin\u2019s observation, and she now directed all\r\nher attacks upon it.\r\n\r\n\u201CI saw Madame Quenu standing at her door this evening,\u201D she would say\r\nsometimes. \u201CIt is quite amazing how well she wears. And she\u2019s so\r\nrefined-looking, too; quite the lady, indeed. It\u2019s the counter that\r\ndoes it, I\u2019m sure. A fine counter gives a woman such a respectable\r\nlook.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn this remark there was a veiled allusion to Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s\r\nproposal. The beautiful Norman would make no reply; but for a moment or\r\ntwo she would seem deep in thought. In her mind\u2019s eye she saw herself\r\nbehind the counter of the wine shop at the other corner of the street,\r\nforming a pendent, as it were, to beautiful Lisa. It was this that\r\nfirst shook her love for Florent.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, it was now becoming a very difficult thing to defend\r\nFlorent. The whole neighbourhood was in arms against him; it seemed as\r\nthough everyone had an immediate interest in exterminating him. Some of\r\nthe market people swore that he had sold himself to the police; while\r\nothers asserted that he had been seen in the butter-cellar, attempting\r\nto make holes in the wire grating, with the intention of tossing\r\nlighted matches through them. There was a vast increase of slander, a\r\nperfect flood of abuse, the source of which could not be exactly\r\ndetermined. The fish pavilion was the last one to join in the revolt\r\nagainst the inspector. The fish-wives liked Florent on account of his\r\ngentleness, and for some time they defended him; but, influenced by the\r\nstallkeepers of the butter and fruit pavilions, they at last gave way.\r\nThen hostilities began afresh between these huge, swelling women and\r\nthe lean and lank inspector. He was lost in the whirl of the voluminous\r\npetticoats and buxom bodices which surged furiously around his scraggy\r\nshoulders. However, he understood nothing, but pursued his course\r\ntowards the realisation of his one haunting idea.\r\n\r\nAt every hour of the day, and in every corner of the market,\r\nMademoiselle Saget\u2019s black bonnet was now to be seen in the midst of\r\nthis outburst of indignation. Her little pale face seemed to multiply.\r\nShe had sworn a terrible vengeance against the company which assembled\r\nin Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s little cabinet. She accused them of having\r\ncirculated the story that she lived on waste scraps of meat. The truth\r\nwas that old Gavard had told the others one evening that the \u201Cold\r\nnanny-goat\u201D who came to play the spy upon them gorged herself with the\r\nfilth which the Bonapartist clique tossed away. Clemence felt quite ill\r\non hearing this, and Robine hurriedly gulped down a draught of beer, as\r\nthough to wash his throat. In Gavard\u2019s opinion, the scraps of meat left\r\non the Emperor\u2019s plate were so much political ordure, the putrid\r\nremnants of all the filth of the reign. Thenceforth the party at\r\nMonsieur Lebigre\u2019s looked on Mademoiselle Saget as a creature whom no\r\none could touch except with tongs. She was regarded as some unclean\r\nanimal that battened upon corruption. Clemence and Gavard circulated\r\nthe story so freely in the markets that the old maid found herself\r\nseriously injured in her intercourse with the shopkeepers, who\r\nunceremoniously bade her go off to the scrap-stalls when she came to\r\nhaggle and gossip at their establishments without the least intention\r\nof buying anything. This cut her off from her sources of information;\r\nand sometimes she was altogether ignorant of what was happening. She\r\nshed tears of rage, and in one such moment of anger she bluntly said to\r\nLa Sarriette and Madame Lec\u0153ur: \u201CYou needn\u2019t give me any more hints:\r\nI\u2019ll settle your Gavard\u2019s hash for him now\u2014that I will!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe two women were rather startled, but refrained from all\r\nprotestation. The next day, however, Mademoiselle Saget had calmed\r\ndown, and again expressed much tender-hearted pity for that poor\r\nMonsieur Gavard who was so badly advised, and was certainly hastening\r\nto his ruin.\r\n\r\nGavard was undoubtedly compromising himself. Ever since the conspiracy\r\nhad begun to ripen he had carried the revolver, which caused Madame\r\nLeonce so much alarm, in his pocket wherever he went. It was a big,\r\nformidable-looking weapon, which he had bought of the principal\r\ngunmaker in Paris. He exhibited it to all the women in the poultry\r\nmarket, like a schoolboy who has got some prohibited novel hidden in\r\nhis desk. First he would allow the barrel to peer out of his pocket,\r\nand call attention to it with a wink. Then he affected a mysterious\r\nreticence, indulged in vague hints and insinuations\u2014played, in short,\r\nthe part of a man who revelled in feigning fear. The possession of this\r\nrevolver gave him immense importance, placed him definitely amongst the\r\ndangerous characters of Paris. Sometimes, when he was safe inside his\r\nstall, he would consent to take it out of his pocket, and exhibit it to\r\ntwo or three of the women. He made them stand before him so as to\r\nconceal him with their petticoats, and then he brandished the weapon,\r\ncocked the lock, caused the breech to revolve, and took aim at one of\r\nthe geese or turkeys that were hanging in the stall. He was immensely\r\ndelighted at the alarm manifested by the women; but eventually\r\nreassured them by stating that the revolver was not loaded. However, he\r\ncarried a supply of cartridges about with him, in a case which he\r\nopened with the most elaborate precautions. When he had allowed his\r\nfriends to feel the weight of the cartridges, he would again place both\r\nweapon and ammunition in his pockets. And afterwards, crossing his arms\r\nover his breast, he would chatter away jubilantly for hours.\r\n\r\n\u201CA man\u2019s a man when he\u2019s got a weapon like that,\u201D he would say with a\r\nswaggering air. \u201CI don\u2019t care a fig now for the gendarmes. A friend and\r\nI went to try it last Sunday on the plain of Saint Denis. Of course,\r\nyou know, a man doesn\u2019t tell everyone that he\u2019s got a plaything of that\r\nsort. But, ah! my dears, we fired at a tree, and hit it every time. Ah,\r\nyou\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll see. You\u2019ll hear of Anatole one of these days, I can\r\ntell you.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe had bestowed the name of Anatole upon the revolver; and he carried\r\nthings so far that in a week\u2019s time both weapon and cartridges were\r\nknown to all the women in the pavilion. His friendship for Florent\r\nseemed to them suspicious; he was too sleek and rich to be visited with\r\nthe hatred that was manifested towards the inspector; still, he lost\r\nthe esteem of the shrewder heads amongst his acquaintances, and\r\nsucceeded in terrifying the timid ones. This delighted him immensely.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is very imprudent for a man to carry firearms about with him,\u201D said\r\nMademoiselle Saget. \u201CMonsieur Gavard\u2019s revolver will end by playing him\r\na nasty trick.\u201D\r\n\r\nGavard now showed the most jubilant bearing at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s.\r\nFlorent, since ceasing to take his meals with the Quenus, had come\r\nalmost to live in the little \u201Ccabinet.\u201D He breakfasted, dined, and\r\nconstantly shut himself up there. In fact he had converted the place\r\nalmost into a sort of private room of his own, where he left his old\r\ncoats and books and papers lying about. Monsieur Lebigre had offered no\r\nobjection to these proceedings; indeed, he had even removed one of the\r\ntables to make room for a cushioned bench, on which Florent could have\r\nslept had he felt so inclined. When the inspector manifested any\r\nscruples about taking advantage of Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s kindness, the\r\nlatter told him to do as he pleased, saying that the whole house was at\r\nhis service. Logre also manifested great friendship for him, and even\r\nconstituted himself his lieutenant. He was constantly discussing\r\naffairs with him, rendering an account of the steps he was supposed to\r\ntake, and furnishing the names of newly affiliated associates. Logre,\r\nindeed, had now assumed the duties of organiser; on him rested the task\r\nof bringing the various plotters together, forming the different\r\nsections, and weaving each mesh of the gigantic net into which Paris\r\nwas to fall at a given signal. Florent meantime remained the leader,\r\nthe soul of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nHowever, much as the hunchback seemed to toil, he attained no\r\nappreciable result. Although he had loudly asserted that in each\r\ndistrict of Paris he knew two or three groups of men as determined and\r\ntrustworthy as those who met at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, he had never yet\r\ngiven any precise information about them, but had merely mentioned a\r\nname here and there, and recounted stories of endless alleged secret\r\nexpeditions, and the wonderful enthusiasm that the people manifested\r\nfor the cause. He made a great point of the hand-grasps he had\r\nreceived. So-and-so, whom he thou\u2019d and thee\u2019d, had squeezed his\r\nfingers and declared he would join them. At the Gros Caillou a big,\r\nburly fellow, who would make a magnificent sectional leader, had almost\r\ndislocated his arm in his enthusiasm; while in the Rue Popincourt a\r\nwhole group of working men had embraced him. He declared that at a\r\nday\u2019s notice a hundred thousand active supporters could be gathered\r\ntogether. Each time that he made his appearance in the little room,\r\nwearing an exhausted air, and dropping with apparent fatigue on the\r\nbench, he launched into fresh variations of his usual reports, while\r\nFlorent duly took notes of what he said, and relied on him to realise\r\nhis many promises. And soon in Florent\u2019s pockets the plot assumed life.\r\nThe notes were looked upon as realities, as indisputable facts, upon\r\nwhich the entire plan of the rising was constructed. All that now\r\nremained to be done was to wait for a favourable opportunity, and Logre\r\nasserted with passionate gesticulations that the whole thing would go\r\non wheels.\r\n\r\nFlorent was at last perfectly happy. His feet no longer seemed to tread\r\nthe ground; he was borne aloft by his burning desire to pass sentence\r\non all the wickedness he had seen committed. He had all the credulity\r\nof a little child, all the confidence of a hero. If Logre had told him\r\nthat the Genius of Liberty perched on the Colonne de Juillet[*] would\r\nhave come down and set itself at their head, he would hardly have\r\nexpressed any surprise. In the evenings, at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s, he\r\nshowed great enthusiasm and spoke effusively of the approaching battle,\r\nas though it were a festival to which all good and honest folks would\r\nbe invited. But although Gavard in his delight began to play with his\r\nrevolver, Charvet got more snappish than ever, and sniggered and\r\nshrugged his shoulders. His rival\u2019s assumption of the leadership\r\nangered him extremely; indeed, quite disgusted him with politics. One\r\nevening when, arriving early, he happened to find himself alone with\r\nLogre and Lebigre, he frankly unbosomed himself.\r\n\r\n[*] The column erected on the Place de la Bastille in memory of the\r\nRevolution of July 1830, by which Charles X was dethroned.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy,\u201D said he, \u201Cthat fellow Florent hasn\u2019t an idea about politics, and\r\nwould have done far better to seek a berth as writing master in a\r\nladies\u2019 school! It would be nothing short of a misfortune if he were to\r\nsucceed, for, with his visionary social sentimentalities, he would\r\ncrush us down beneath his confounded working men! It\u2019s all that, you\r\nknow, which ruins the party. We don\u2019t need any more tearful\r\nsentimentalists, humanitarian poets, people who kiss and slobber over\r\neach other for the merest scratch. But he won\u2019t succeed! He\u2019ll just get\r\nlocked up, and that will be the end of it.\u201D\r\n\r\nLogre and the wine dealer made no remark, but allowed Charvet to talk\r\non without interruption.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd he\u2019d have been locked up long ago,\u201D he continued, \u201Cif he were\r\nanything as dangerous as he fancies he is. The airs he puts on just\r\nbecause he\u2019s been to Cayenne are quite sickening. But I\u2019m sure that the\r\npolice knew of his return the very first day he set foot in Paris, and\r\nif they haven\u2019t interfered with him it\u2019s simply because they hold him\r\nin contempt.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Logre gave a slight start.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey\u2019ve been dogging me for the last fifteen years,\u201D resumed the\r\nH\u00E9bertist, with a touch of pride, \u201Cbut you don\u2019t hear me proclaiming it\r\nfrom the house-tops. However, he won\u2019t catch me taking part in his\r\nriot. I\u2019m not going to let myself be nabbed like a mere fool. I dare\r\nsay he\u2019s already got half a dozen spies at his heels, who will take him\r\nby the scruff of the neck whenever the authorities give the word.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, dear, no! What an idea!\u201D exclaimed Monsieur Lebigre, who usually\r\nobserved complete silence. He was rather pale, and looked at Logre, who\r\nwas gently rubbing his hump against the partition.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s mere imagination,\u201D murmured the hunchback.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well; call it imagination, if you like,\u201D replied the tutor; \u201Cbut\r\nI know how these things are arranged. At all events, I don\u2019t mean to\r\nlet the \u2018coppers\u2019 nab me this time. You others, of course, will please\r\nyourselves, but if you take my advice\u2014and you especially, Monsieur\r\nLebigre\u2014you\u2019ll take care not to let your establishment be compromised,\r\nor the authorities will close it.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Logre could not restrain a smile. On several subsequent\r\noccasions Charvet plied him and Lebigre with similar arguments, as\r\nthough he wished to detach them from Florent\u2019s project by frightening\r\nthem; and he was much surprised at the calmness and confidence which\r\nthey both continued to manifest. For his own part, he still came pretty\r\nregularly in the evening with Clemence. The tall brunette was no longer\r\na clerk at the fish auctions\u2014Monsieur Manoury had discharged her.\r\n\r\n\u201CThose salesmen are all scoundrels!\u201D Logre growled, when he heard of\r\nher dismissal.\r\n\r\nThereupon Clemence, who, lolling back against the partition, was\r\nrolling a cigarette between her long, slim fingers, replied in a sharp\r\nvoice: \u201COh, it\u2019s fair fighting! We don\u2019t hold the same political views,\r\nyou know. That fellow Manoury, who\u2019s making no end of money, would lick\r\nthe Emperor\u2019s boots. For my part, if I were an auctioneer, I wouldn\u2019t\r\nkeep him in my service for an hour.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe truth was that she had been indulging in some clumsy pleasantry,\r\namusing herself one day by inscribing in the sale-book, alongside of\r\nthe dabs and skate and mackerel sold by auction, the names of some of\r\nthe best-known ladies and gentlemen of the Court. This bestowal of\r\npiscine names upon high dignitaries, these entries of the sale of\r\nduchesses and baronesses at thirty sous apiece, had caused Monsieur\r\nManoury much alarm. Gavard was still laughing over it.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, never mind!\u201D said he, patting Clemence\u2019s arm; \u201Cyou are every\r\ninch a man, you are!\u201D\r\n\r\nClemence had discovered a new method of mixing her grog. She began by\r\nfilling her glass with hot water; and after adding some sugar she\r\npoured the rum drop by drop upon the slice of lemon floating on the\r\nsurface, in such wise that it did not mix with the water. Then she\r\nlighted it and with a grave expression watched it blaze, slowly smoking\r\nher cigarette while the flame of the alcohol cast a greenish tinge over\r\nher face. \u201CGrog,\u201D however, was an expensive luxury in which she could\r\nnot afford to indulge after she had lost her place. Charvet told her,\r\nwith a strained laugh, that she was no longer a millionaire. She\r\nsupported herself by giving French lessons, at a very early hour in the\r\nmorning, to a young lady residing in the Rue de Miromesnil, who was\r\nperfecting her education in secrecy, unknown even to her maid. And so\r\nnow Clemence merely ordered a glass of beer in the evenings, but this\r\nshe drank, it must be admitted, with the most philosophical composure.\r\n\r\nThe evenings in the little sanctum were now far less noisy than they\r\nhad been. Charvet would suddenly lapse into silence, pale with\r\nsuppressed rage, when the others deserted him to listen to his rival.\r\nThe thought that he had been the king of the place, had ruled the whole\r\nparty with despotic power before Florent\u2019s appearance there, gnawed at\r\nhis heart, and he felt all the regretful pangs of a dethroned monarch.\r\nIf he still came to the meetings, it was only because he could not\r\nresist the attraction of the little room where he had spent so many\r\nhappy hours in tyrannising over Gavard and Robine. In those days even\r\nLogre\u2019s hump had been his property, as well as Alexandre\u2019s fleshy arms\r\nand Lacaille\u2019s gloomy face. He had done what he liked with them,\r\nstuffed his opinions down their throats, belaboured their shoulders\r\nwith his sceptre. But now he endured much bitterness of spirit; and\r\nended by quite ceasing to speak, simply shrugging his shoulders and\r\nwhistling disdainfully, without condescending to combat the absurdities\r\nvented in his presence. What exasperated him more than anything else\r\nwas the gradual way in which he had been ousted from his position of\r\npredominance without being conscious of it. He could not see that\r\nFlorent was in any way his superior, and after hearing the latter speak\r\nfor hours, in his gentle and somewhat sad voice, he often remarked:\r\n\u201CWhy, the fellow\u2019s a parson! He only wants a cassock!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe others, however, to all appearance eagerly absorbed whatever the\r\ninspector said. When Charvet saw Florent\u2019s clothes hanging from every\r\npeg, he pretended not to know where he could put his hat so that it\r\nwould not be soiled. He swept away the papers that lay about the little\r\nroom, declaring that there was no longer any comfort for anyone in the\r\nplace since that \u201Cgentleman\u201D had taken possession of it. He even\r\ncomplained to the landlord, and asked if the room belonged to a single\r\ncustomer or to the whole company. This invasion of his realm was indeed\r\nthe last straw. Men were brutes, and he conceived an unspeakable scorn\r\nfor humanity when he saw Logre and Monsieur Lebigre fixing their eyes\r\non Florent with rapt attention. Gavard with his revolver irritated him,\r\nand Robine, who sat silent behind his glass of beer, seemed to him to\r\nbe the only sensible person in the company, and one who doubtless\r\njudged people by their real value, and was not led away by mere words.\r\nAs for Alexandre and Lacaille, they confirmed him in his belief that\r\n\u201Cthe people\u201D were mere fools, and would require at least ten years of\r\nrevolutionary dictatorship to learn how to conduct themselves.\r\n\r\nLogre, however, declared that the sections would soon be completely\r\norganised; and Florent began to assign the different parts that each\r\nwould have to play. One evening, after a final discussion in which he\r\nagain got worsted, Charvet rose up, took his hat, and exclaimed: \u201CWell,\r\nI\u2019ll wish you all good night. You can get your skulls cracked if it\r\namuses you; but I would have you understand that I won\u2019t take any part\r\nin the business. I have never abetted anybody\u2019s ambition.\u201D\r\n\r\nClemence, who had also risen and was putting on her shawl, coldly\r\nadded: \u201CThe plan\u2019s absurd.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as Robine sat watching their departure with a gentle glance,\r\nCharvet asked him if he were not coming with them; but Robine, having\r\nstill some beer left in his glass, contented himself with shaking\r\nhands. Charvet and Clemence never returned again; and Lacaille one day\r\ninformed the company that they now frequented a beer-house in the Rue\r\nSerpente. He had seen them through the window, gesticulating with great\r\nenergy, in the midst of an attentive group of very young men.\r\n\r\nFlorent was never able to enlist Claude amongst his supporters. He had\r\nonce entertained the idea of gaining him over to his own political\r\nviews, of making a disciple of him, an assistant in his revolutionary\r\ntask; and in order to initiate him he had taken him one evening to\r\nMonsieur Lebigre\u2019s. Claude, however, spent the whole time in making a\r\nsketch of Robine, in his hat and chestnut cloak, and with his beard\r\nresting on the knob of his walking-stick.\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, you know,\u201D he said to Florent, as they came away, \u201Call that\r\nyou have been saying inside there doesn\u2019t interest me in the least. It\r\nmay be very clever, but, for my own part, I see nothing in it. Still,\r\nyou\u2019ve got a splendid fellow there, that blessed Robine. He\u2019s as deep\r\nas a well. I\u2019ll come with you again some other time, but it won\u2019t be\r\nfor politics. I shall make sketches of Logre and Gavard, so as to put\r\nthem with Robine in a picture which I was thinking about while you were\r\ndiscussing the question of\u2014what do you call it? eh? Oh, the question of\r\nthe two Chambers. Just fancy, now, a picture of Gavard and Logre and\r\nRobine talking politics, entrenched behind their glasses of beer! It\r\nwould be the success of the Salon, my dear fellow, an overwhelming\r\nsuccess, a genuine modern picture!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent was grieved by the artist\u2019s political scepticism; so he took\r\nhim up to his bedroom, and kept him on the narrow balcony in front of\r\nthe bluish mass of the markets, till two o\u2019clock in the morning,\r\nlecturing him, and telling him that he was no man to show himself so\r\nindifferent to the happiness of his country.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, you\u2019re perhaps right,\u201D replied Claude, shaking his head; \u201CI\u2019m an\r\negotist. I can\u2019t even say that I paint for the good of my country; for,\r\nin the first place, my sketches frighten everybody, and then, when I\u2019m\r\nbusy painting, I think about nothing but the pleasure I take in it.\r\nWhen I\u2019m painting, it is as though I were tickling myself; it makes me\r\nlaugh all over my body. Well, I can\u2019t help it, you know; it\u2019s my nature\r\nto be like that; and you can\u2019t expect me to go and drown myself in\r\nconsequence. Besides, France can get on very well without me, as my\r\naunt Lisa says. And\u2014may I be quite frank with you?\u2014if I like you it\u2019s\r\nbecause you seem to me to follow politics just as I follow painting.\r\nYou titillate yourself, my good friend.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, as Florent protested, he continued:\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, yes; you are an artist in your own way; you dream of politics,\r\nand I\u2019ll wager you spend hours here at night gazing at the stars and\r\nimagining they are the voting-papers of infinity. And then you\r\ntitillate yourself with your ideas of truth and justice; and this is so\r\nevidently the case that those ideas of yours cause just as much alarm\r\nto commonplace middle-class folks as my sketches do. Between ourselves,\r\nnow, do you imagine that if you were Robine I should take any pleasure\r\nin your friendship? Ah, no, my friend, you are a great poet!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he began to joke on the subject, saying that politics caused him\r\nno trouble, and that he had got accustomed to hear people discussing\r\nthem in beer shops and studios. This led him to speak of a caf\u00E9 in the\r\nRue Vauvilliers; the caf\u00E9 on the ground-floor of the house where La\r\nSarriette lodged. This smoky place, with its torn, velvet-cushioned\r\nseats, and marble table-tops discoloured by the drippings from\r\ncoffee-cups, was the chief resort of the young people of the markets.\r\nMonsieur Jules reigned there over a company of porters, apprentices,\r\nand gentlemen in white blouses and velvet caps. Two curling \u201CNewgate\r\nknockers\u201D were glued against his temples; and to keep his neck white he\r\nhad it scraped with a razor every Saturday at a hair-dresser\u2019s in the\r\nRue des Deux Ecus. At the caf\u00E9 he gave the tone to his associates,\r\nespecially when he played billiards with studied airs and graces,\r\nshowing off his figure to the best advantage. After the game the\r\ncompany would begin to chat. They were a very reactionary set, taking a\r\ndelight in the doings of \u201Csociety.\u201D For his part, Monsieur Jules read\r\nthe lighter boulevardian newspapers, and knew the performers at the\r\nsmaller theatres, talked familiarly of the celebrities of the day, and\r\ncould always tell whether the piece first performed the previous\r\nevening had been a success or a failure. He had a weakness, however,\r\nfor politics. His ideal man was Morny, as he curtly called him. He read\r\nthe reports of the discussions of the Corps L\u00E9gislatif, and laughed\r\nwith glee over the slightest words that fell from Morny\u2019s lips. Ah,\r\nMorny was the man to sit upon your rascally republicans! And he would\r\nassert that only the scum detested the Emperor, for his Majesty desired\r\nthat all respectable people should have a good time of it.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve been to the caf\u00E9 occasionally,\u201D Claude said to Florent. \u201CThe\r\nyoung men there are vastly amusing, with their clay pipes and their\r\ntalk about the Court balls! To hear them chatter you might almost fancy\r\nthey were invited to the Tuileries. La Sarriette\u2019s young man was making\r\ngreat fun of Gavard the other evening. He called him uncle. When La\r\nSarriette came downstairs to look for him she was obliged to pay his\r\nbill. It cost her six francs, for he had lost at billiards, and the\r\ndrinks they had played for were owing. And now, good night, my friend,\r\nand pleasant dreams. If ever you become a Minister, I\u2019ll give you some\r\nhints on the beautifying of Paris.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent was obliged to relinquish the hope of making a docile disciple\r\nof Claude. This was a source of grief to him, for, blinded though he\r\nwas by his fanatical ardour, he at last grew conscious of the\r\never-increasing hostility which surrounded him. Even at the Mehudins\u2019\r\nhe now met with a colder reception: the old woman would laugh slyly;\r\nMuche no longer obeyed him, and the beautiful Norman cast glances of\r\nhasty impatience at him, unable as she was to overcome his coldness. At\r\nthe Quenus\u2019, too, he had lost Auguste\u2019s friendship. The assistant no\r\nlonger came to see him in his room on the way to bed, being greatly\r\nalarmed by the reports which he heard concerning this man with whom he\r\nhad previously shut himself up till midnight. Augustine had made her\r\nlover swear that he would never again be guilty of such imprudence;\r\nhowever, it was Lisa who turned the young man into Florent\u2019s determined\r\nenemy by begging him and Augustine to defer their marriage till her\r\ncousin should vacate the little bedroom at the top of the house, as she\r\ndid not want to give that poky dressing-room on the first floor to the\r\nnew shop girl whom she would have to engage. From that time forward\r\nAuguste was anxious that the \u201Cconvict\u201D should be arrested. He had found\r\nsuch a pork shop as he had long dreamed of, not at Plaisance certainly,\r\nbut at Montrouge, a little farther away. And now trade had much\r\nimproved, and Augustine, with her silly, overgrown girl\u2019s laugh, said\r\nthat she was quite ready. So every night, whenever some slight noise\r\nawoke him, August was thrilled with delight as he imagined that the\r\npolice were at last arresting Florent.\r\n\r\nNothing was said at the Quenu-Gradelles\u2019 about all the rumours which\r\ncirculated. There was a tacit understanding amongst the staff of the\r\npork shop to keep silent respecting them in the presence of Quenu. The\r\nlatter, somewhat saddened by the falling-out between his brother and\r\nhis wife, sought consolation in stringing his sausages and salting his\r\npork. Sometimes he would come and stand on his door-step, with his red\r\nface glowing brightly above his white apron, which his increasing\r\ncorpulence stretched quite taut, and never did he suspect all the\r\ngossip which his appearance set on foot in the markets. Some of the\r\nwomen pitied him, and thought that he was losing flesh, though he was,\r\nindeed, stouter than ever; while others, on the contrary, reproached\r\nhim for not having grown thin with shame at having such a brother as\r\nFlorent. He, however, like one of those betrayed husbands who are\r\nalways the last to know what has befallen them, continued in happy\r\nignorance, displaying a light-heartedness which was quite affecting. He\r\nwould stop some neighbour\u2019s wife on the footway to ask her if she found\r\nhis brawn or truffled boar\u2019s head to her liking, and she would at once\r\nassume a sympathetic expression, and speak in a condoling way, as\r\nthough all the pork on his premises had got jaundice.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do they all mean by looking at me with such a funereal air?\u201D he\r\nasked Lisa one day. \u201CDo you think I\u2019m looking ill?\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa, well aware that he was terribly afraid of illness, and groaned\r\nand made a dreadful disturbance if he suffered the slightest ailment,\r\nreassured him on this point, telling him that he was as blooming as a\r\nrose. The fine pork shop, however, was becoming gloomy; the mirrors\r\nseemed to pale, the marbles grew frigidly white, and the cooked meats\r\non the counter stagnated in yellow fat or lakes of cloudy jelly. One\r\nday, even, Claude came into the shop to tell his aunt that the display\r\nin the window looked quite \u201Cin the dumps.\u201D This was really the truth.\r\nThe Strasburg tongues on their beds of blue paper-shavings had a\r\nmelancholy whiteness of hue, like the tongues of invalids; and the\r\nwhilom chubby hams seemed to be wasting away beneath their mournful\r\ngreen top-knots. Inside the shop, too, when customers asked for a\r\nblack-pudding or ten sous\u2019 worth of bacon, or half a pound of lard,\r\nthey spoke in subdued, sorrowful voices, as though they were in the\r\nbed-chamber of a dying man. There were always two or three lachrymose\r\nwomen in front of the chilled heating-pan. Beautiful Lisa meantime\r\ndischarged the duties of chief mourner with silent dignity. Her white\r\napron fell more primly than ever over her black dress. Her hands,\r\nscrupulously clean and closely girded at the wrists by long white\r\nsleevelets, her face with its becoming air of sadness, plainly told all\r\nthe neighbourhood, all the inquisitive gossips who streamed into the\r\nshop from morning to night, that they, the Quenu-Gradelles, were\r\nsuffering from unmerited misfortune, but that she knew the cause of it,\r\nand would triumph over it at last. And sometimes she stooped to look at\r\nthe two gold-fish, who also seemed ill at ease as they swam languidly\r\naround the aquarium in the window, and her glance seemed to promise\r\nthem better days in the future.\r\n\r\nBeautiful Lisa now only allowed herself one indulgence. She fearlessly\r\npatted Marjolin\u2019s satiny chin. The young man had just come out of the\r\nhospital. His skull had healed, and he looked as fat and merry as ever;\r\nbut even the little intelligence he had possessed had left him, he was\r\nnow quite an idiot. The gash in his skull must have reached his brain,\r\nfor he had become a mere animal. The mind of a child of five dwelt in\r\nhis sturdy frame. He laughed and stammered, he could no longer\r\npronounce his words properly, and he was as submissively obedient as a\r\nsheep. Cadine took entire possession of him again; surprised, at first,\r\nat the alteration in him, and then quite delighted at having this big\r\nfellow to do exactly as she liked with. He was her doll, her toy, her\r\nslave in all respects but one: she could not prevent him from going off\r\nto Madame Quenu\u2019s every now and then. She thumped him, but he did not\r\nseem to feel her blows; as soon as she had slung her basket round her\r\nneck, and set off to sell her violets in the Rue du Pont Neuf and the\r\nRue de Turbigo, he went to prowl about in front of the pork shop.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome in!\u201D Lisa cried to him.\r\n\r\nShe generally gave him some gherkins, of which he was extremely fond;\r\nand he ate them, laughing in a childish way, whilst he stood in front\r\nof the counter. The sight of the handsome mistress of the shop filled\r\nhim with rapture; he often clapped his hands with joy and began to jump\r\nabout and vent little cries of pleasure, like a child delighted at\r\nsomething shown to it. On the first few occasions when he came to see\r\nher after leaving the hospital Lisa had feared that he might remember\r\nwhat had happened.\r\n\r\n\u201CDoes your head still hurt you?\u201D she asked him.\r\n\r\nBut he swayed about and burst into a merry laugh as he answered no; and\r\nthen Lisa gently inquired: \u201CYou had a fall, hadn\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, a fall, fall, fall,\u201D he sang, in a happy voice, tapping his skull\r\nthe while.\r\n\r\nThen, as though he were in a sort of ecstasy, he continued in lingering\r\nnotes, as he gazed at Lisa, \u201CBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful!\u201D This\r\nquite touched Madame Quenu. She had prevailed upon Gavard to keep him\r\nin his service. It was on the occasions when he so humbly vented his\r\nadmiration that she caressed his chin, and told him that he was a good\r\nlad. He smiled with childish satisfaction, at times closing his eyes\r\nlike some domestic pet fondled by its mistress; and Lisa thought to\r\nherself that she was making him some compensation for the blow with\r\nwhich she had felled him in the cellar of the poultry market.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Quenus\u2019 establishment still remained under a cloud.\r\nFlorent sometimes ventured to show himself, and shook hands with his\r\nbrother, while Lisa observed a frigid silence. He even dined with them\r\nsometimes on Sundays, at long intervals, and Quenu then made great\r\nefforts at gaiety, but could not succeed in imparting any cheerfulness\r\nto the meal. He ate badly, and ended by feeling altogether put out. One\r\nevening, after one of these icy family gatherings, he said to his wife\r\nwith tears in his eyes:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat can be the matter with me? Is it true that I\u2019m not ill? Don\u2019t you\r\nreally see anything wrong in my appearance? I feel just as though I\u2019d\r\ngot a heavy weight somewhere inside me. And I\u2019m so sad and depressed,\r\ntoo, without in the least knowing why. What can it be, do you think?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, a little attack of indigestion, I dare say,\u201D replied Lisa.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no; it\u2019s been going on too long for that; I feel quite crushed\r\ndown. Yet the business is going on all right; I\u2019ve no great worries,\r\nand I am leading just the same steady life as ever. But you, too, my\r\ndear, don\u2019t look well; you seem melancholy. If there isn\u2019t a change for\r\nthe better soon, I shall send for the doctor.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa looked at him with a grave expression.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s no need of a doctor,\u201D she said, \u201Cthings will soon be all right\r\nagain. There\u2019s something unhealthy in the atmosphere just now. All the\r\nneighbourhood is unwell.\u201D Then, as if yielding to an impulse of anxious\r\naffection, she added: \u201CDon\u2019t worry yourself, my dear. I can\u2019t have you\r\nfalling ill; that would be the crowning blow.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs a rule she sent him back to the kitchen, knowing that the noise of\r\nthe choppers, the tuneful simmering of the fat, and the bubbling of the\r\npans had a cheering effect upon him. In this way, too, she kept him at\r\na distance from the indiscreet chatter of Mademoiselle Saget, who now\r\nspent whole mornings in the shop. The old maid seemed bent on arousing\r\nLisa\u2019s alarm, and thus driving her to some extreme step. She began by\r\ntrying to obtain her confidence.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a lot of mischievous folks there are about!\u201D she exclaimed;\r\n\u201Cfolks who would be much better employed in minding their own business.\r\nIf you only knew, my dear Madame Quenu\u2014but no, really, I should never\r\ndare to repeat such things to you.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd, as Madame Quenu replied that she was quite indifferent to gossip,\r\nand that it had no effect upon her, the old maid whispered into her ear\r\nacross the counter: \u201CWell, people say, you know, that Monsieur Florent\r\nisn\u2019t your cousin at all.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she gradually allowed Lisa to see that she knew the whole story;\r\nby way of proving that she had her quite at her mercy. When Lisa\r\nconfessed the truth, equally as a matter of diplomacy, in order that\r\nshe might have the assistance of some one who would keep her well\r\nposted in all the gossip of the neighbourhood, the old maid swore that\r\nfor her own part she would be as mute as a fish, and deny the truth of\r\nthe reports about Florent, even if she were to be led to the stake for\r\nit. And afterwards this drama brought her intense enjoyment; every\r\nmorning she came to the shop with some fresh piece of disturbing news.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must be careful,\u201D she whispered one day; \u201CI have just heard two\r\nwomen in the tripe market talking about you know what. I can\u2019t\r\ninterrupt people and tell them they are lying, you know. It would look\r\nso strange. But the story\u2019s got about, and it\u2019s spreading farther every\r\nday. It can\u2019t be stopped now, I fear; the truth will have to come out.\u201D\r\n\r\nA few days later she returned to the assault in all earnest. She made\r\nher appearance looking quite scared, and waited impatiently till there\r\nwas no one in the shop, when she burst out in her sibilant voice:\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know what people are saying now? Well, they say that all those\r\nmen who meet at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s have got guns, and are going to\r\nbreak out again as they did in \u201848. It\u2019s quite distressing to see such\r\na worthy man as Monsieur Gavard\u2014rich, too, and so respectable\u2014leaguing\r\nhimself with such scoundrels! I was very anxious to let you know, on\r\naccount of your brother-in-law.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, it\u2019s mere nonsense, I\u2019m sure; it can\u2019t be serious,\u201D rejoined Lisa,\r\njust to incite the old maid to tell her more.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot serious, indeed! Why, when one passes along the Rue Pirouette in\r\nthe evening one can hear them screaming out in the most dreadful way.\r\nOh! they make no mystery of it all. You know yourself how they tried to\r\ncorrupt your husband. And the cartridges which I have seen them making\r\nfrom my own window, are they mere nonsense? Well, well, I\u2019m only\r\ntelling you this for your own good.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh! I\u2019m sure of that, and I\u2019m very much obliged to you,\u201D replied Lisa;\r\n\u201Cbut people do invent such stories, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, but this is no invention, unfortunately. The whole neighbourhood\r\nis talking of it. It is said, too, that if the police discover the\r\nmatter there will be a great many people compromised\u2014Monsieur Gavard,\r\nfor instance.\u201D\r\n\r\nMadame Quenu shrugged her shoulders as though to say that Monsieur\r\nGavard was an old fool, and that it would do him good to be locked up.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I merely mention Monsieur Gavard as I might mention any of the\r\nothers, your brother-in-law, for instance,\u201D resumed the old maid with a\r\nwily glance. \u201CYour brother-in-law is the leader, it seems. That\u2019s very\r\nannoying for you, and I\u2019m very sorry indeed; for if the police were to\r\nmake a descent here they might march Monsieur Quenu off as well. Two\r\nbrothers, you know, they\u2019re like two fingers of the same hand.\u201D\r\n\r\nBeautiful Lisa protested against this, but she turned very pale, for\r\nMademoiselle Saget\u2019s last thrust had touched a vulnerable point. From\r\nthat day forward the old maid was ever bringing her stories of innocent\r\npeople who had been thrown into prison for extending hospitality to\r\ncriminal scoundrels. In the evening, when La Saget went to get her\r\nblack-currant syrup at the wine dealer\u2019s, she prepared her budget for\r\nthe next morning. Rose was but little given to gossiping, and the old\r\nmain reckoned chiefly on her own eyes and ears. She had been struck by\r\nMonsieur Lebigre\u2019s extremely kind and obliging manner towards Florent,\r\nhis eagerness to keep him at his establishment, all the polite\r\ncivilities, for which the little money which the other spent in the\r\nhouse could never recoup him. And this conduct of Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s\r\nsurprised her the more as she was aware of the position in which the\r\ntwo men stood in respect to the beautiful Norman.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt looks as though Lebigre were fattening him up for sale,\u201D she\r\nreflected. \u201CWhom can he want to sell him to, I wonder?\u201D\r\n\r\nOne evening when she was in the bar she saw Logre fling himself on the\r\nbench in the sanctum, and heard him speak of his perambulations through\r\nthe faubourgs, with the remark that he was dead beat. She cast a hasty\r\nglance at his feet, and saw that there was not a speck of dust on his\r\nboots. Then she smiled quietly, and went off with her black-currant\r\nsyrup, her lips closely compressed.\r\n\r\nShe used to complete her budget of information on getting back to her\r\nwindow. It was very high up, commanding a view of all the neighbouring\r\nhouses, and proved a source of endless enjoyment to her. She was\r\nconstantly installed at it, as though it were an observatory from which\r\nshe kept watch upon everything that went on in the neighbourhood. She\r\nwas quite familiar with all the rooms opposite her, both on the right\r\nand the left, even to the smallest details of their furniture. She\r\ncould have described, without the least omission, the habits of their\r\ntenants, have related if the latter\u2019s homes were happy or the contrary,\r\nhave told when and how they washed themselves, what they had for\r\ndinner, and who it was that came to see them. Then she obtained a side\r\nview of the markets, and not a woman could walk along the Rue Rambuteau\r\nwithout being seen by her; and she could have correctly stated whence\r\nthe woman had come and whither she was going, what she had got in her\r\nbasket, and, in short, every detail about her, her husband, her\r\nclothes, her children, and her means. \u201CThat\u2019s Madame Loret, over there;\r\nshe\u2019s giving her son a fine education; that\u2019s Madame Hutin, a poor\r\nlittle woman who\u2019s dreadfully neglected by her husband; that\u2019s\r\nMademoiselle Cecile, the butcher\u2019s daughter, a girl that no one will\r\nmarry because she\u2019s scrofulous.\u201D In this way she could have continued\r\njerking out biographical scraps for days together, deriving\r\nextraordinary amusement from the most trivial, uninteresting incidents.\r\nHowever, as soon as eight o\u2019clock struck, she only had eyes for the\r\nfrosted \u201Ccabinet\u201D window on which appeared the black shadows of the\r\ncoterie of politicians. She discovered the secession of Charvet and\r\nClemence by missing their bony silhouettes from the milky transparency.\r\nNot an incident occurred in that room but she sooner or later learnt it\r\nby some sudden motion of those silent arms and heads. She acquired\r\ngreat skill in interpretation, and could divine the meaning of\r\nprotruding noses, spreading fingers, gaping mouths, and shrugging\r\nshoulders; and in this way she followed the progress of the conspiracy\r\nstep by step, in such wise that she could have told day by day how\r\nmatters stood. One evening the terrible outcome of it all was revealed\r\nto her. She saw the shadow of Gavard\u2019s revolver, a huge silhouette with\r\npointed muzzle showing very blackly against the glimmering window. It\r\nkept appearing and disappearing so rapidly that it seemed as though the\r\nroom was full of revolvers. Those were the firearms of which\r\nMademoiselle Saget had spoken to Madame Quenu. On another evening she\r\nwas much puzzled by the sight of endless lengths of some material or\r\nother, and came to the conclusion that the men must be manufacturing\r\ncartridges. The next morning, however, she made her appearance in the\r\nwine shop by eleven o\u2019clock, on the pretext of asking Rose if she could\r\nlet her have a candle, and, glancing furtively into the little sanctum,\r\nshe espied a heap of red material lying on the table. This greatly\r\nalarmed her, and her next budget of news was one of decisive gravity.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t want to alarm you, Madame Quenu,\u201D she said, \u201Cbut matters are\r\nreally looking very serious. Upon my word, I\u2019m quite alarmed. You must\r\non no account repeat what I am going to confide to you. They would\r\nmurder me if they knew I had told you.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, when Lisa had sworn to say nothing that might compromise her, she\r\ntold her about the red material.\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t think what it can be. There was a great heap of it. It looked\r\njust like rags soaked in blood. Logre, the hunchback, you know, put one\r\nof the pieces over his shoulder. He looked like a headsman. You may be\r\nsure this is some fresh trickery or other.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa made no reply, but seemed deep in thought whilst with lowered\r\neyes, she handled a fork and mechanically arranged some piece of salt\r\npork on a dish.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I were you,\u201D resumed Mademoiselle Saget softly, \u201CI shouldn\u2019t be\r\neasy in mind; I should want to know the meaning of it all. Why\r\nshouldn\u2019t you go upstairs and examine your brother-in-law\u2019s bedroom?\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Lisa gave a slight start, let the fork drop, and glanced\r\nuneasily at the old maid, believing that she had discovered her\r\nintentions. But the other continued: \u201CYou would certainly be justified\r\nin doing so. There\u2019s no knowing into what danger your brother-in-law\r\nmay lead you, if you don\u2019t put a check on him. They were talking about\r\nyou yesterday at Madame Taboureau\u2019s. Ah! you have a most devoted friend\r\nin her. Madame Taboureau said that you were much too easy-going, and\r\nthat if she were you she would have put an end to all this long ago.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMadame Taboureau said that?\u201D murmured Lisa thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, indeed she did; and Madame Taboureau is a woman whose advice is\r\nworth listening to. Try to find out the meaning of all those red bands;\r\nand if you do, you\u2019ll tell me, won\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa, however, was no longer listening to her. She was gazing\r\nabstractedly at the edible snails and Gervais cheeses between the\r\nfestoons of sausages in the window. She seemed absorbed in a mental\r\nconflict, which brought two little furrows to her brow. The old maid,\r\nhowever, poked her nose over the dishes on the counter.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, some slices of saveloy!\u201D she muttered, as though she were speaking\r\nto herself. \u201CThey\u2019ll get very dry cut up like that. And that\r\nblack-pudding\u2019s broken, I see\u2014a fork\u2019s been stuck into it, I expect. It\r\nmight be taken away\u2014it\u2019s soiling the dish.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa, still absent-minded, gave her the black-pudding and slices of\r\nsaveloy. \u201CYou may take them,\u201D she said, \u201Cif you would care for them.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe black bag swallowed them up. Mademoiselle Saget was so accustomed\r\nto receiving presents that she had actually ceased to return thanks for\r\nthem. Every morning she carried away all the scraps of the pork shop.\r\nAnd now she went off with the intention of obtaining her dessert from\r\nLa Sarriette and Madame Lec\u0153ur, by gossiping to them about Gavard.\r\n\r\nWhen Lisa was alone again she installed herself on the bench, behind\r\nthe counter, as though she thought she would be able to come to a\r\nsounder decision if she were comfortably seated. For the last week she\r\nhad been very anxious. Florent had asked Quenu for five hundred francs\r\none evening, in the easy, matter-of-course way of a man who had money\r\nlying to his credit at the pork shop. Quenu referred him to his wife.\r\nThis was distasteful to Florent, who felt somewhat uneasy on applying\r\nto beautiful Lisa. But she immediately went up to her bedroom, brought\r\nthe money down and gave it to him, without saying a word, or making the\r\nleast inquiry as to what he intended to do with it. She merely remarked\r\nthat she had made a note of the payment on the paper containing the\r\nparticulars of Florent\u2019s share of the inheritance. Three days later he\r\ntook a thousand francs.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was scarcely worth while trying to make himself out so\r\ndisinterested,\u201D Lisa said to Quenu that night, as they went to bed. \u201CI\r\ndid quite right, you see, in keeping the account. By the way, I haven\u2019t\r\nnoted down the thousand francs I gave him to-day.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe sat down at the secr\u00E9taire, and glanced over the page of figures.\r\nThen she added: \u201CI did well to leave a blank space. I\u2019ll put down what\r\nI pay him on the margin. You\u2019ll see, now, he\u2019ll fritter it all away by\r\ndegrees. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been expecting for a long time past.\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu said nothing, but went to bed feeling very much put out. Every\r\ntime that his wife opened the secr\u00E9taire the drawer gave out a mournful\r\ncreak which pierced his heart. He even thought of remonstrating with\r\nhis brother, and trying to prevent him from ruining himself with the\r\nMehudins; but when the time came, he did not dare to do it. Two days\r\nlater Florent asked for another fifteen hundred francs. Logre had said\r\none evening that things would ripen much faster if they could only get\r\nsome money. The next day he was enchanted to find these words of his,\r\nuttered quite at random, result in the receipt of a little pile of\r\ngold, which he promptly pocketed, sniggering as he did so, and his\r\nhunch fairly shaking with delight. From that time forward money was\r\nconstantly being needed: one section wished to hire a room where they\r\ncould meet, while another was compelled to provide for various needy\r\npatriots. Then there were arms and ammunition to be purchased, men to\r\nbe enlisted, and private police expenses. Florent would have paid for\r\nanything. He had bethought himself of Uncle Gradelle\u2019s treasure, and\r\nrecalled La Normande\u2019s advice. So he made repeated calls upon Lisa\u2019s\r\nsecr\u00E9taire, being merely kept in check by the vague fear with which his\r\nsister-in-law\u2019s grave face inspired him. Never, thought he, could he\r\nhave spent his money in a holier cause. Logre now manifested the\r\ngreatest enthusiasm, and wore the most wonderful rose-coloured\r\nneckerchiefs and the shiniest of varnished boots, the sight of which\r\nmade Lacaille glower blackly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat makes three thousand francs in seven days,\u201D Lisa remarked to\r\nQuenu. \u201CWhat do you think of that? A pretty state of affairs, isn\u2019t it?\r\nIf he goes on at this rate his fifty thousand francs will last him\r\nbarely four months. And yet it took old Gradelle forty years to put his\r\nfortune together!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s all your own fault!\u201D cried Quenu. \u201CThere was no occasion for you\r\nto say anything to him about the money.\u201D\r\n\r\nLisa gave her husband a severe glance. \u201CIt is his own,\u201D she said; \u201Cand\r\nhe is entitled to take it all. It\u2019s not the giving him the money that\r\nvexes me, but the knowledge that he must make a bad use of it. I tell\r\nyou again, as I have been telling you for a long time past, all this\r\nmust come to an end.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo whatever you like; I won\u2019t prevent you,\u201D at last exclaimed the pork\r\nbutcher, who was tortured by his cupidity.\r\n\r\nHe still loved his brother; but the thought of fifty thousand francs\r\nsquandered in four months was agony to him. As for his wife, after all\r\nMademoiselle Saget\u2019s chattering she guessed what became of the money.\r\nThe old maid having ventured to refer to the inheritance, Lisa had\r\ntaken advantage of the opportunity to let the neighbourhood know that\r\nFlorent was drawing his share, and spending it after his own fashion.\r\n\r\nIt was on the following day that the story of the strips of red\r\nmaterial impelled Lisa to take definite action. For a few moments she\r\nremained struggling with herself whilst gazing at the depressed\r\nappearance of the shop. The sides of pork hung all around in a sullen\r\nfashion, and Mouton, seated beside a bowl of fat, displayed the ruffled\r\ncoat and dim eyes of a cat who no longer digests his meals in peace.\r\nThereupon Lisa called to Augustine and told her to attend to the\r\ncounter, and she herself went up to Florent\u2019s room.\r\n\r\nWhen she entered it, she received quite a shock. The bed, hitherto so\r\nspotless, was quite ensanguined by a bundle of long red scarves\r\ndangling down to the floor. On the mantelpiece, between the gilt\r\ncardboard boxes and the old pomatum-pots, were several red armlets and\r\nclusters of red cockades, looking like pools of blood. And hanging from\r\nevery nail and peg against the faded grey wallpaper were pieces of\r\nbunting, square flags\u2014yellow, blue, green, and black\u2014in which Lisa\r\nrecognised the distinguishing banners of the twenty sections. The\r\nchildish simplicity of the room seemed quite scared by all this\r\nrevolutionary decoration. The aspect of guileless stupidity which the\r\nshop girl had left behind her, the white innocence of the curtains and\r\nfurniture, now glared as with the reflection of a fire; while the\r\nphotograph of Auguste and Augustine looked white with terror. Lisa\r\nwalked round the room, examining the flags, the armlets, and the\r\nscarves, without touching any of them, as though she feared that the\r\ndreadful things might burn her. She was reflecting that she had not\r\nbeen mistaken, that it was indeed on these and similar things that\r\nFlorent\u2019s money had been spent. And to her this seemed an utter\r\nabomination, an incredibility which set her whole being surging with\r\nindignation. To think that her money, that money which had been so\r\nhonestly earned, was being squandered to organise and defray the\r\nexpenses of an insurrection!\r\n\r\nShe stood there, gazing at the expanded blossoms of the pomegranate on\r\nthe balcony\u2014blossoms which seemed to her like an additional supply of\r\ncrimson cockades\u2014and listening to the sharp notes of the chaffinch,\r\nwhich resembled the echo of a distant fusillade. And then it struck her\r\nthat the insurrection might break out the next day, or perhaps that\r\nvery evening. She fancied she could see the banners streaming in the\r\nair and the scarves advancing in line, while a sudden roll of drums\r\nbroke on her ear. Then she hastily went downstairs again, without even\r\nglancing at the papers which were lying on the table. She stopped on\r\nthe first floor, went into her own room, and dressed herself.\r\n\r\nIn this critical emergency Lisa arranged her hair with scrupulous care\r\nand perfect calmness. She was quite resolute; not a quiver of\r\nhesitation disturbed her; but a sterner expression than usual had come\r\ninto her eyes. As she fastened her black silk dress, straining the\r\nwaistband with all the strength of her fingers, she recalled Abb\u00E9\r\nRoustan\u2019s words; and she questioned herself, and her conscience\r\nanswered that she was going to fulfil a duty. By the time she drew her\r\nbroidered shawl round her broad shoulders, she felt that she was about\r\nto perform a deed of high morality. She put on a pair of dark mauve\r\ngloves, secured a thick veil to her bonnet; and before leaving the room\r\nshe double-locked the secr\u00E9taire, with a hopeful expression on her face\r\nwhich seemed to say that that much worried piece of furniture would at\r\nlast be able to sleep in peace again.\r\n\r\nQuenu was exhibiting his white paunch at the shop door when his wife\r\ncame down. He was surprised to see her going out in full dress at ten\r\no\u2019clock in the morning. \u201CHallo! Where are you off to?\u201D he asked.\r\n\r\nShe pretended that she was going out with Madame Taboureau, and added\r\nthat she would call at the Gait\u00E9 Theatre to buy some tickets. Quenu\r\nhurried after her to tell her to secure some front seats, so that they\r\nmight be able to see well. Then, as he returned to the shop, Lisa made\r\nher way to the cab-stand opposite St. Eustache, got into a cab, pulled\r\ndown the blinds, and told the driver to go to the Gait\u00E9 Theatre. She\r\nfelt afraid of being followed. When she had booked two seats, however,\r\nshe directed the cabman to drive her to the Palais de Justice. There,\r\nin front of the gate, she discharged him, and then quietly made her way\r\nthrough the halls and corridors to the Prefecture of Police.\r\n\r\nShe soon lost herself in a noisy crowd of police officers and gentlemen\r\nin long frock-coats, but at last gave a man half a franc to guide her\r\nto the Prefect\u2019s rooms. She found, however, that the Prefect only\r\nreceived such persons as came with letters of audience; and she was\r\nshown into a small apartment, furnished after the style of a\r\nboarding-house parlour. A fat, bald-headed official, dressed in black\r\nfrom head to foot, received her there with sullen coldness. What was\r\nher business? he inquired. Thereupon she raised her veil, gave her\r\nname, and told her story, clearly and distinctly, without a pause. The\r\nbald man listened with a weary air.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are this man\u2019s sister-in-law, are you not?\u201D he inquired, when she\r\nhad finished.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D Lisa candidly replied. \u201CWe are honest, straight-forward people,\r\nand I am anxious that my husband should not be compromised.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe official shrugged his shoulders, as though to say that the whole\r\naffair was a great nuisance.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know,\u201D he said impatiently, \u201Cthat I have been pestered with\r\nthis business for more than a year past? Denunciation after\r\ndenunciation has been sent to me, and I am being continually goaded and\r\npressed to take action. You will understand that if I haven\u2019t done so\r\nas yet, it is because I prefer to wait. We have good reasons for our\r\nconduct in the matter. Stay, now, here are the papers relating to it.\r\nI\u2019ll let you see them.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe laid before her an immense collection of papers in a blue wrapper.\r\nLisa turned them over. They were like detached chapters of the story\r\nshe had just been relating. The commissaires of police at Havre, Rouen,\r\nand Vernon notified Florent\u2019s arrival within their respective\r\njurisdictions. Then came a report which announced that he had taken up\r\nhis residence with the Quenu-Gradelles. Next followed his appointment\r\nat the markets, an account of his mode of life, the spending of his\r\nevenings at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s; not a detail was deficient. Lisa, quite\r\nastounded as she was, noticed that the reports were in duplicate, so\r\nthat they must have emanated from two different sources. And at last\r\nshe came upon a pile of letters, anonymous letters of every shape, and\r\nin every description of handwriting. They brought her amazement to a\r\nclimax. In one letter she recognised the villainous hand of\r\nMademoiselle Saget, denouncing the people who met in the little sanctum\r\nat Lebigre\u2019s. On a large piece of greasy paper she identified the heavy\r\npot-hooks of Madame Lec\u0153ur; and there was also a sheet of cream-laid\r\nnote-paper, ornamented with a yellow pansy, and covered with the\r\nscrawls of La Sarriette and Monsieur Jules. These two letters warned\r\nthe Government to beware of Gavard. Farther on Lisa recognised the\r\ncoarse style of old Madame Mehudin, who in four pages of almost\r\nindecipherable scribble repeated all the wild stories about Florent\r\nthat circulated in the markets. However, what startled her more than\r\nanything else was the discovery of a bill-head of her own\r\nestablishment, with the inscription _Quenu-Gradelle, Pork Butcher_, on\r\nits face, whilst on the back of it Auguste had penned a denunciation of\r\nthe man whom he looked upon as an obstacle to his marriage.\r\n\r\nThe official had acted upon a secret idea in placing these papers\r\nbefore her. \u201CYou don\u2019t recognise any of these handwritings, do you?\u201D he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D she stammered, rising from her seat, quite oppressed by what she\r\nhad just learned; and she hastily pulled down her veil again to conceal\r\nthe blush of confusion which was rising to her cheeks. Her silk dress\r\nrustled, and her dark gloves disappeared beneath her heavy shawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou see, madame,\u201D said the bald man with a faint smile, \u201Cyour\r\ninformation comes a little late. But I promise you that your visit\r\nshall not be forgotten. And tell your husband not to stir. It is\r\npossible that something may happen soon that\u2014\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nHe did not complete his sentence, but, half rising from his armchair,\r\nmade a slight bow to Lisa. It was a dismissal, and she took her leave.\r\nIn the ante-room she caught sight of Logre and Monsieur Lebigre, who\r\nhastily turned their faces away; but she was more disturbed than they\r\nwere. She went her way through the halls and along the corridors,\r\nfeeling as if she were in the clutches of this system of police which,\r\nit now seemed to her, saw and knew everything. At last she came out\r\nupon the Place Dauphine. When she reached the Quai de l\u2019Horloge she\r\nslackened her steps, and felt refreshed by the cool breeze blowing from\r\nthe Seine.\r\n\r\nShe now had a keen perception of the utter uselessness of what she had\r\ndone. Her husband was in no danger whatever; and this thought, whilst\r\nrelieving her, left her a somewhat remorseful feeling. She was\r\nexasperated with Auguste and the women who had put her in such a\r\nridiculous position. She walked on yet more slowly, watching the Seine\r\nas it flowed past. Barges, black with coal-dust, were floating down the\r\ngreenish water; and all along the bank anglers were casting their\r\nlines. After all, it was not she who had betrayed Florent. This\r\nreflection suddenly occurred to her and astonished her. Would she have\r\nbeen guilty of a wicked action, then, if she had been his betrayer? She\r\nwas quite perplexed; surprised at the possibility of her conscience\r\nhaving deceived her. Those anonymous letters seemed extremely base. She\r\nherself had gone openly to the authorities, given her name, and saved\r\ninnocent people from being compromised. Then at the sudden thought of\r\nold Gradelle\u2019s fortune she again examined herself, and felt ready to\r\nthrow the money into the river if such a course should be necessary to\r\nremove the blight which had fallen on the pork shop. No, she was not\r\navaricious, she was sure she wasn\u2019t; it was no thought of money that\r\nhad prompted her in what she had just done. As she crossed the Pont au\r\nChange she grew quite calm again, recovering all her superb equanimity.\r\nOn the whole, it was much better, she felt, that others should have\r\nanticipated her at the Prefecture. She would not have to deceive Quenu,\r\nand she would sleep with an easier conscience.\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you booked the seats?\u201D Quenu asked her when she returned home.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to see the tickets, and made Lisa explain to him the exact\r\nposition the seats occupied in the dress-circle. Lisa had imagined that\r\nthe police would make a descent upon the house immediately after\r\nreceiving her information, and her proposal to go to the theatre had\r\nonly been a wily scheme for getting Quenu out of the way while the\r\nofficers were arresting Florent. She had contemplated taking him for an\r\nouting in the afternoon\u2014one of those little jaunts which they\r\noccasionally allowed themselves. They would then drive in an open cab\r\nto the Bois de Boulogne, dine at a restaurant, and amuse themselves for\r\nan hour or two at some caf\u00E9 concern. But there was no need to go out\r\nnow, she thought; so she spent the rest of the day behind her counter,\r\nwith a rosy glow on her face, and seeming brighter and gayer, as though\r\nshe were recovering from some indisposition.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou see, I told you it was fresh air you wanted!\u201D exclaimed Quenu.\r\n\u201CYour walk this morning has brightened you up wonderfully!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, indeed,\u201D she said after a pause, again assuming her look of\r\nseverity; \u201Cthe streets of Paris are not at all healthy places.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn the evening they went to the Gait\u00E9 to see the performance of \u201CLa\r\nGr\u00E2ce de Dieu.\u201D Quenu, in a frock-coat and drab gloves, with his hair\r\ncarefully pomatumed and combed, was occupied most of the time in\r\nhunting for the names of the performers in the programme. Lisa looked\r\nsuperb in her low dress as she rested her hands in their tight-fitting\r\nwhite gloves on the crimson velvet balustrade. They were both of them\r\ndeeply affected by the misfortunes of Marie. The commander, they\r\nthought, was certainly a desperate villain; while Pierrot made them\r\nlaugh from the first moment of his appearance on the stage. But at last\r\nMadame Quenu cried. The departure of the child, the prayer in the\r\nmaiden\u2019s chamber, the return of the poor mad creature, moistened her\r\neyes with gentle tears, which she brushed away with her handkerchief.\r\n\r\nHowever, the pleasure which the evening afforded her turned into a\r\nfeeling of triumph when she caught sight of La Normande and her mother\r\nsitting in the upper gallery. She thereupon puffed herself out more\r\nthan ever, sent Quenu off to the refreshment bar for a box of caramels,\r\nand began to play with her fan, a mother-of-pearl fan, elaborately\r\ngilt. The fish-girl was quite crushed; and bent her head down to listen\r\nto her mother, who was whispering to her. When the performance was over\r\nand beautiful Lisa and the beautiful Norman met in the vestibule they\r\nexchanged a vague smile.\r\n\r\nFlorent had dined early at Monsieur Lebigre\u2019s that day. He was\r\nexpecting Logre, who had promised to introduce to him a retired\r\nsergeant, a capable man, with whom they were to discuss the plan of\r\nattack upon the Palais Bourbon and the H\u00F4tel de Ville. The night closed\r\nin, and the fine rain, which had begun to fall in the afternoon,\r\nshrouded the vast markets in a leaden gloom. They loomed darkly against\r\nthe copper-tinted sky, while wisps of murky cloud skimmed by almost on\r\na level with the roofs, looking as though they were caught and torn by\r\nthe points of the lightning-conductors. Florent felt depressed by the\r\nsight of the muddy streets, and the streaming yellowish rain which\r\nseemed to sweep the twilight away and extinguish it in the mire. He\r\nwatched the crowds of people who had taken refuge on the foot-pavements\r\nof the covered ways, the umbrellas flitting past in the downpour, and\r\nthe cabs that dashed with increased clatter and speed along the\r\nwellnigh deserted roads. Presently there was a rift in the clouds; and\r\na red glow arose in the west. Then a whole army of street-sweepers came\r\ninto sight at the end of the Rue Montmartre, driving a lake of liquid\r\nmud before them with their brooms.\r\n\r\nLogre did not turn up with the sergeant; Gavard had gone to dine with\r\nsome friends at Batignolles, and so Florent was reduced to spending the\r\nevening alone with Robine. He had all the talking to himself, and ended\r\nby feeling very low-spirited. His companion merely wagged his beard,\r\nand stretched out his hand every quarter of an hour to raise his glass\r\nof beer to his lips. At last Florent grew so bored that he went off to\r\nbed. Robine, however, though left to himself, still lingered there,\r\ncontemplating his glass with an expression of deep thought. Rose and\r\nthe waiter, who had hoped to shut up early, as the coterie of\r\npoliticians was absent, had to wait a long half hour before he at last\r\nmade up his mind to leave.\r\n\r\nWhen Florent got to his room, he felt afraid to go to bed. He was\r\nsuffering from one of those nervous attacks which sometimes plunged him\r\ninto horrible nightmares until dawn. On the previous day he had been to\r\nClamart to attend the funeral of Monsieur Verlaque, who had died after\r\nterrible sufferings; and he still felt sad at the recollection of the\r\nnarrow coffin which he had seen lowered into the earth. Nor could he\r\nbanish from his mind the image of Madame Verlaque, who, with a tearful\r\nvoice, though there was not a tear in her eyes, kept following him and\r\nspeaking to him about the coffin, which was not paid for, and of the\r\ncost of the funeral, which she was quite at a loss about, as she had\r\nnot a copper in the place, for the druggist, on hearing of her\r\nhusband\u2019s death on the previous day, had insisted upon his bill being\r\npaid. So Florent had been obliged to advance the money for the coffin\r\nand other funeral expenses, and had even given the gratuities to the\r\nmutes. Just as he was going away, Madame Verlaque looked at him with\r\nsuch a heartbroken expression that he left her twenty francs.\r\n\r\nAnd now Monsieur Verlaque\u2019s death worried him very much. It affected\r\nhis situation in the markets. He might lose his berth, or perhaps be\r\nformally appointed inspector. In either case he foresaw vexatious\r\ncomplications which might arouse the suspicions of the police. He would\r\nhave been delighted if the insurrection could have broken out the very\r\nnext day, so that he might at once have tossed the laced cap of his\r\ninspectorship into the streets. With his mind full of harassing\r\nthoughts like these, he stepped out upon the balcony, as though\r\nsoliciting of the warm night some whiff of air to cool his fevered\r\nbrow. The rain had laid the wind, and a stormy heat still reigned\r\nbeneath the deep blue, cloudless heavens. The markets, washed by the\r\ndownpour, spread out below him, similar in hue to the sky, and, like\r\nthe sky, studded with the yellow stars of their gas lamps.\r\n\r\nLeaning on the iron balustrade, Florent recollected that sooner or\r\nlater he would certainly be punished for having accepted the\r\ninspectorship. It seemed to lie like a stain on his life. He had become\r\nan official of the Prefecture, forswearing himself, serving the Empire\r\nin spite of all the oaths he had taken in his exile. His anxiety to\r\nplease Lisa, the charitable purpose to which he had devoted the salary\r\nhe received, the just and scrupulous manner in which he had always\r\nstruggled to carry out his duties, no longer seemed to him valid\r\nexcuses for his base abandonment of principle. If he had suffered in\r\nthe midst of all that sleek fatness, he had deserved to suffer. And\r\nbefore him arose a vision of the evil year which he had just spent, his\r\npersecution by the fish-wives, the sickening sensations he had felt on\r\nclose, damp days, the continuous indigestion which had afflicted his\r\ndelicate stomach, and the latent hostility which was gathering strength\r\nagainst him. All these things he now accepted as chastisement. That\r\ndull rumbling of hostility and spite, the cause of which he could not\r\ndivine, must forebode some coming catastrophe before whose approach he\r\nalready stooped, with the shame of one who knows there is a\r\ntransgression that he must expiate. Then he felt furious with himself\r\nas he thought of the popular rising he was preparing; and reflected\r\nthat he was no longer unsullied enough to achieve success.\r\n\r\nIn how many dreams he had indulged in that lofty little room, with his\r\neyes wandering over the spreading roofs of the market pavilions! They\r\nusually appeared to him like grey seas that spoke to him of far-off\r\ncountries. On moonless nights they would darken and turn into stagnant\r\nlakes of black and pestilential water. But on bright nights they became\r\nshimmering fountains of light, the moonbeams streaming over both tiers\r\nlike water, gliding along the huge plates of zinc, and flowing over the\r\nedges of the vast superposed basins. Then frosty weather seemed to turn\r\nthese roofs into rigid ice, like the Norwegian bays over which skaters\r\nskim; while the warm June nights lulled them into deep sleep. One\r\nDecember night, on opening his window, he had seen them white with\r\nsnow, so lustrously white that they lighted up the coppery sky.\r\nUnsullied by a single footstep, they then stretched out like the lonely\r\nplains of the Far North, where never a sledge intrudes. Their silence\r\nwas beautiful, their soft peacefulness suggestive of innocence.\r\n\r\nAnd at each fresh aspect of the ever-changing panorama before him,\r\nFlorent yielded to dreams which were now sweet, now full of bitter\r\npain. The snow calmed him; the vast sheet of whiteness seemed to him\r\nlike a veil of purity thrown over the filth of the markets. The bright,\r\nclear nights, the shimmering moonbeams, carried him away into the\r\nfairy-land of story-books. It was only the dark, black nights, the\r\nburning nights of June, when he beheld, as it were, a miasmatic marsh,\r\nthe stagnant water of a dead and accursed sea, that filled him with\r\ngloom and grief; and then ever the same dreadful visions haunted his\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nThe markets were always there. He could never open the window and rest\r\nhis elbows on the balustrade without having them before him, filling\r\nthe horizon. He left the pavilions in the evening only to behold their\r\nendless roofs as he went to bed. They shut him off from the rest of\r\nParis, ceaselessly intruded their huge bulk upon him, entered into\r\nevery hour of his life. That night again horrible fancies came to him,\r\nfancies aggravated by the vague forebodings of evil which distressed\r\nhim. The rain of the afternoon had filled the markets with malodorous\r\ndampness, and as they wallowed there in the centre of the city, like\r\nsome drunken man lying, after his last bottle, under the table, they\r\ncast all their foul breath into his face. He seemed to see a thick\r\nvapour rising up from each pavilion. In the distance the meat and tripe\r\nmarkets reeked with the sickening steam of blood; nearer in, the\r\nvegetable and fruit pavilions diffused the odour of pungent cabbages,\r\nrotten apples, and decaying leaves; the butter and cheese exhaled a\r\npoisonous stench; from the fish market came a sharp, fresh gust; while\r\nfrom the ventilator in the tower of the poultry pavilion just below\r\nhim, he could see a warm steam issuing, a fetid current rising in coils\r\nlike the sooty smoke from a factory chimney. And all these exhalations\r\ncoalesced above the roofs, drifted towards the neighbouring houses, and\r\nspread themselves out in a heavy cloud which stretched over the whole\r\nof Paris. It was as though the markets were bursting within their tight\r\nbelt of iron, were beating the slumber of the gorged city with the\r\nstertorous fumes of their midnight indigestion.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the footway down below Florent presently heard a sound of\r\nvoices, the laughter of happy folks. Then the door of the passage was\r\nclosed noisily. It was Quenu and Lisa coming home from the theatre.\r\nStupefied and intoxicated, as it were, by the atmosphere he was\r\nbreathing, Florent thereupon left the balcony, his nerves still\r\npainfully excited by the thought of the tempest which he could feel\r\ngathering round his head. The source of his misery was yonder, in those\r\nmarkets, heated by the day\u2019s excesses. He closed the window with\r\nviolence, and left them wallowing in the darkness, naked and perspiring\r\nbeneath the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nA week later, Florent thought that he would at last be able to proceed\r\nto action. A sufficiently serious outburst of public dissatisfaction\r\nfurnished an opportunity for launching his insurrectionary forces upon\r\nParis. The Corps L\u00E9gislatif, whose members had lately shown great\r\nvariance of opinion respecting certain grants to the Imperial family,\r\nwas now discussing a bill for the imposition of a very unpopular tax,\r\nat which the lower orders had already begun to growl. The Ministry,\r\nfearing a defeat, was straining every nerve. It was probable, thought\r\nFlorent, that no better pretext for a rising would for a long time\r\npresent itself.\r\n\r\nOne morning, at daybreak, he went to reconnoitre the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Palais Bourbon. He forgot all about his duties as inspector, and\r\nlingered there, studying the approaches of the palace, till eight\r\no\u2019clock, without ever thinking that his absence would revolutionise the\r\nfish market. He perambulated all the surrounding streets, the Rue de\r\nLille, the Rue de l\u2019Universit\u00E9, the Rue de Bourgogne, the Rue Saint\r\nDominique, and even extended his examination to the Esplanade des\r\nInvalides, stopping at certain crossways, and measuring distances as he\r\nwalked along. Then, on coming back to the Quai d\u2019Orsay, he sat down on\r\nthe parapet, and determined that the attack should be made\r\nsimultaneously from all sides. The contingents from the Gros-Caillou\r\ndistrict should arrive by way of the Champ de Mars; the sections from\r\nthe north of Paris should come down by the Madeleine; while those from\r\nthe west and the south would follow the quays, or make their way in\r\nsmall detachments through the then narrow streets of the Faubourg Saint\r\nGermain. However, the other side of the river, the Champs Elysees, with\r\ntheir open avenues, caused him some uneasiness; for he foresaw that\r\ncannon would be stationed there to sweep the quays. He thereupon\r\nmodified several details of his plan, and marked down in a\r\nmemorandum-book the different positions which the several sections\r\nshould occupy during the combat. The chief attack, he concluded, must\r\ncertainly be made from the Rue de Bourgogne and the Rue de\r\nl\u2019Universit\u00E9, while a diversion might be effected on the side of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nWhilst he thus pondered over his plans the eight o\u2019clock sun, warming\r\nthe nape of his neck, shone gaily on the broad footways, and gilded the\r\ncolumns of the great structure in front of him. In imagination he\r\nalready saw the contemplated battle; clusters of men clinging round\r\nthose columns, the gates burst open, the peristyle invaded; and then\r\nscraggy arms suddenly appearing high aloft and planting a banner there.\r\n\r\nAt last he slowly went his way homewards again with his gaze fixed upon\r\nthe ground. But all at once a cooing sound made him look up, and he saw\r\nthat he was passing through the garden of the Tuileries. A number of\r\nwood-pigeons, bridling their necks, were strutting over a lawn near by.\r\nFlorent leant for a moment against the tub of an orange-tree, and\r\nlooked at the grass and the pigeons steeped in sunshine. Right ahead\r\nunder the chestnut-trees all was black. The garden was wrapped in a\r\nwarm silence, broken only by the distant rumbling which came from\r\nbehind the railings of the Rue de Rivoli. The scent of all the greenery\r\naffected Florent, reminding him of Madame Francois. However, a little\r\ngirl ran past, trundling a hoop, and alarmed the pigeons. They flew\r\noff, and settled in a row on the arm of a marble statue of an antique\r\nwrestler standing in the middle of the lawn, and once more, but with\r\nless vivacity, they began to coo and bridle their necks.\r\n\r\nAs Florent was returning to the markets by way of the Rue Vauvilliers,\r\nhe heard Claude Lantier calling to him. The artist was going down into\r\nthe basement of the poultry pavilion. \u201CCome with me!\u201D he cried. \u201CI\u2019m\r\nlooking for that brute Marjolin.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent followed, glad to forget his thoughts and to defer his return\r\nto the fish market for a little longer. Claude told him that his friend\r\nMarjolin now had nothing further to wish for: he had become an utter\r\nanimal. Claude entertained an idea of making him pose on all-fours in\r\nfuture. Whenever he lost his temper over some disappointing sketch he\r\ncame to spend whole hours in the idiot\u2019s company, never speaking, but\r\nstriving to catch his expression when he laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019ll be feeding his pigeons, I dare say,\u201D he said; \u201Cbut unfortunately\r\nI don\u2019t know whereabouts Monsieur Gavard\u2019s storeroom is.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey groped about the cellar. In the middle of it some water was\r\ntrickling from a couple of taps in the dim gloom. The storerooms here\r\nare reserved for pigeons exclusively, and all along the trellising they\r\nheard faint cooings, like the hushed notes of birds nestling under the\r\nleaves when daylight is departing. Claude began to laugh as he heard\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt sounds as though all the lovers in Paris were embracing each other\r\ninside here, doesn\u2019t it?\u201D he exclaimed to his companion.\r\n\r\nHowever, they could not find a single storeroom open, and were\r\nbeginning to think that Marjolin could not be in the cellar, when a\r\nsound of loud, smacking kisses made them suddenly halt before a door\r\nwhich stood slightly ajar. Claude pulled it open and beheld Marjolin,\r\nwhom Cadine was kissing, whilst he, a mere dummy, offered his face\r\nwithout feeling the slightest thrill at the touch of her lips.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, so this is your little game, is it?\u201D said Claude with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201COh,\u201D replied Cadine, quite unabashed, \u201Che likes being kissed, because\r\nhe feels afraid now in the dim light. You do feel frightened, don\u2019t\r\nyou?\u201D\r\n\r\nLike the idiot he was, Marjolin stroked his face with his hands as\r\nthough trying to find the kisses which the girl had just printed there.\r\nAnd he was beginning to stammer out that he was afraid, when Cadine\r\ncontinued: \u201CAnd, besides, I came to help him; I\u2019ve been feeding the\r\npigeons.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent looked at the poor creatures. All along the shelves were rows\r\nof lidless boxes, in which pigeons, showing their motley plumage,\r\ncrowded closely on their stiffened legs. Every now and then a tremor\r\nran along the moving mass; and then the birds settled down again, and\r\nnothing was heard but their confused, subdued notes. Cadine had a\r\nsaucepan near her; she filled her mouth with the water and tares which\r\nit contained, and then, taking up the pigeons one by one, shot the food\r\ndown their throats with amazing rapidity. The poor creatures struggled\r\nand nearly choked, and finally fell down in the boxes with swimming\r\neyes, intoxicated, as it were, by all the food which they were thus\r\nforced to swallow.[*]\r\n\r\n[*] This is the customary mode of fattening pigeons at the Paris\r\nmarkets. The work is usually done by men who make a specialty of it,\r\nand are called _gaveurs_.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CPoor creatures!\u201D exclaimed Claude.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, so much the worse for them,\u201D said Cadine, who had now finished.\r\n\u201CThey are much nicer eating when they\u2019ve been well fed. In a couple of\r\nhours or so all those over yonder will be given a dose of salt water.\r\nThat makes their flesh white and tender. Then two hours afterwards\r\nthey\u2019ll be killed. If you would like to see the killing, there are some\r\nhere which are quite ready. Marjolin will settle their account for them\r\nin a jiffy.\u201D\r\n\r\nMarjolin carried away a box containing some fifty pigeons, and Claude\r\nand Florent followed him. Squatting upon the ground near one of the\r\nwater-taps, he placed the box by his side. Then he laid a framework of\r\nslender wooden bars on the top of a kind of zinc trough, and forthwith\r\nbegan to kill the pigeons. His knife flashed rapidly in his fingers, as\r\nhe seized the birds by the wings, stunned them by a blow on the head\r\nfrom the knife-handle, and then thrust the point of the blade into\r\ntheir throats. They quivered for an instant, and ruffled their feathers\r\nas Marjolin laid them in a row, with their heads between the wooden\r\nbars above the zinc trough, into which their blood fell drop by drop.\r\nHe repeated each different movement with the regularity of clockwork,\r\nthe blows from the knife-handle falling with a monotonous tick-tack as\r\nhe broke the birds\u2019 skulls, and his hand working backwards and forwards\r\nlike a pendulum as he took up the living pigeons on one side and laid\r\nthem down dead on the other. Soon, moreover, he worked with increasing\r\nrapidity, gloating over the massacre with glistening eyes, squatting\r\nthere like a huge delighted bull-dog enjoying the sight of slaughtered\r\nvermin. \u201CTick-tack! Tick-tack!\u201D whilst his tongue clucked as an\r\naccompaniment to the rhythmical movements of his knife. The pigeons\r\nhung down like wisps of silken stuff.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, you enjoy that, don\u2019t you, you great stupid?\u201D exclaimed Cadine.\r\n\u201CHow comical those pigeons look when they bury their heads in their\r\nshoulders to hide their necks! They\u2019re horrid things, you know, and\r\nwould give one nasty bites if they got the chance.\u201D Then she laughed\r\nmore loudly at Marjolin\u2019s increasing, feverish haste; and added: \u201CI\u2019ve\r\nkilled them sometimes myself, but I can\u2019t get on as quickly as he does.\r\nOne day he killed a hundred in ten minutes.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe wooden frame was nearly full; the blood could be heard falling into\r\nthe zinc trough; and as Claude happened to turn round he saw Florent\r\nlooking so pale that he hurriedly led him away. When they got\r\nabove-ground again he made him sit down on a step.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201D he exclaimed, tapping him on the\r\nshoulder. \u201CYou\u2019re fainting away like a woman!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s the smell of the cellar,\u201D murmured Florent, feeling a little\r\nashamed of himself.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, however, that those pigeons, which were forced to\r\nswallow tares and salt water, and then had their skulls broken and\r\ntheir throats slit, had reminded him of the wood-pigeons of the\r\nTuileries gardens, strutting over the green turf, with their satiny\r\nplumage flashing iridescently in the sunlight. He again heard them\r\ncooing on the arm of the marble wrestler amidst the hushed silence of\r\nthe garden, while children trundled their hoops in the deep gloom of\r\nthe chestnuts. And then, on seeing that big fair-haired animal\r\nmassacring his boxful of birds, stunning them with the handle of his\r\nknife and driving its point into their throats, in the depths of that\r\nfoul-smelling cellar, he had felt sick and faint, his legs had almost\r\ngiven way beneath him, while his eyelids quivered tremulously.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, you\u2019d never do for a soldier!\u201D Claude said to him when he\r\nrecovered from his faintness. \u201CThose who sent you to Cayenne must have\r\nbeen very simple-minded folks to fear such a man as you! Why, my good\r\nfellow, if ever you do put yourself at the head of a rising, you won\u2019t\r\ndare to fire a shot. You\u2019ll be too much afraid of killing somebody.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent got up without making any reply. He had become very gloomy, his\r\nface was furrowed by deep wrinkles; and he walked off, leaving Claude\r\nto go back to the cellar alone. As he made his way towards the fish\r\nmarket his thoughts returned to his plan of attack, to the levies of\r\narmed men who were to invade the Palais Bourbon. Cannon would roar from\r\nthe Champs Elysees; the gates would be burst open; blood would stain\r\nthe steps, and men\u2019s brains would bespatter the pillars. A vision of\r\nthe fight passed rapidly before him; and he beheld himself in the midst\r\nof it, deadly pale, and hiding his face in his hands, not daring to\r\nlook around him.\r\n\r\nAs he was crossing the Rue du Pont Neuf he fancied he espied Auguste\u2019s\r\npale face peering round the corner of the fruit pavilion. The assistant\r\nseemed to be watching for someone, and his eyes were starting from his\r\nhead with an expression of intense excitement. Suddenly, however, he\r\nvanished and hastened back to the pork shop.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201D thought Florent. \u201CIs he frightened of me,\r\nI wonder?\u201D\r\n\r\nSome very serious occurrences had taken place that morning at the\r\nQuenu-Gradelles\u2019. Soon after daybreak, Auguste, breathless with\r\nexcitement, had awakened his mistress to tell her that the police had\r\ncome to arrest Monsieur Florent. And he added, with stammering\r\nincoherence, that the latter had gone out, and that he must have done\r\nso with the intention of escaping. Lisa, careless of appearances, at\r\nonce hurried up to her brother-in-law\u2019s room in her dressing-wrapper,\r\nand took possession of La Normande\u2019s photograph, after glancing round\r\nto see if there was anything lying about that might compromise herself\r\nand Quenu. As she was making her way downstairs again, she met the\r\npolice agents on the first floor. The commissary requested her to\r\naccompany them to Florent\u2019s room, where, after speaking to her for a\r\nmoment in a low tone, he installed himself with his men, bidding her\r\nopen the shop as usual so as to avoid giving the alarm to anyone. The\r\ntrap was set.\r\n\r\nLisa\u2019s only worry in the matter was the terrible blow that the arrest\r\nwould prove to poor Quenu. She was much afraid that if he learned that\r\nthe police were in the house, he would spoil everything by his tears;\r\nso she made Auguste swear to observe the most rigid silence on the\r\nsubject. Then she went back to her room, put on her stays, and\r\nconcocted some story for the benefit of Quenu, who was still drowsy.\r\nHalf an hour later she was standing at the door of the shop with all\r\nher usual neatness of appearance, her hair smooth and glossy, and her\r\nface glowing rosily. Auguste was quietly setting out the window. Quenu\r\ncame for a moment on to the footway, yawning slightly, and ridding\r\nhimself of all sleepiness in the fresh morning air. There was nothing\r\nto indicate the drama that was in preparation upstairs.\r\n\r\nThe commissary himself, however, gave the alarm to the neighbourhood by\r\npaying a domiciliary visit to the Mehudins\u2019 abode in the Rue Pirouette.\r\nHe was in possession of the most precise information. In the anonymous\r\nletters which had been sent to the Prefecture, all sorts of statements\r\nwere made respecting Florent\u2019s alleged intrigue with the beautiful\r\nNorman. Perhaps, thought the commissary, he had now taken refuge with\r\nher; and so, accompanied by two of his men, he proceeded to knock at\r\nthe door in the name of the law. The Mehudins had only just got up. The\r\nold woman opened the door in a fury; but suddenly calmed down and began\r\nto smile when she learned the business on hand. She seated herself and\r\nfastened her clothes, while declaring to the officers: \u201CWe are honest\r\nfolks here, and have nothing to be afraid of. You can search wherever\r\nyou like.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, as La Normande delayed to open the door of her room, the\r\ncommissary told his men to break it open. The young woman was scarcely\r\nclad when the others entered, and this unceremonious invasion, which\r\nshe could not understand, fairly exasperated her. She flushed crimson\r\nfrom anger rather than from shame, and seemed as though she were about\r\nto fly at the officers. The commissary, at the sight, stepped forward\r\nto protect his men, repeating in his cold voice: \u201CIn the name of the\r\nlaw! In the name of the law!\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon La Normande threw herself upon a chair, and burst into a wild\r\nfit of hysterical sobbing at finding herself so powerless. She was\r\nquite at a loss to understand what these men wanted with her. The\r\ncommissary, however, had noticed how scantily she was clad, and taking\r\na shawl from a peg, he flung it over her. Still she did not wrap it\r\nround her, but only sobbed the more bitterly as she watched the men\r\nroughly searching the apartment.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut what have I done?\u201D she at last stammered out. \u201CWhat are you\r\nlooking for here?\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon the commissary pronounced the name of Florent; and La\r\nNormande, catching sight of the old woman, who was standing at the\r\ndoor, cried out: \u201COh, the wretch! This is her doing!\u201D and she rushed at\r\nher mother.\r\n\r\nShe would have struck her if she had reached her; but the police agents\r\nheld her back, and forcibly wrapped her in the shawl. Meanwhile, she\r\nstruggled violently, and exclaimed in a choking voice:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you take me for? That Florent has never been in this room, I\r\ntell you. There was nothing at all between us. People are always trying\r\nto injure me in the neighbourhood; but just let anyone come here and\r\nsay anything before my face, and then you\u2019ll see! You\u2019ll lock me up\r\nafterwards, I dare say, but I don\u2019t mind that! Florent, indeed! What a\r\nlie! What nonsense!\u201D\r\n\r\nThis flood of words seemed to calm her; and her anger now turned\r\nagainst Florent, who was the cause of all the trouble. Addressing the\r\ncommissary, she sought to justify herself.\r\n\r\n\u201CI did not know his real character, sir,\u201D she said. \u201CHe had such a mild\r\nmanner that he deceived us all. I was unwilling to believe all I heard,\r\nbecause I know people are so malicious. He only came here to give\r\nlessons to my little boy, and went away directly they were over. I gave\r\nhim a meal here now and again, that\u2019s true and sometimes made him a\r\npresent of a fine fish. That\u2019s all. But this will be a warning to me,\r\nand you won\u2019t catch me showing the same kindness to anyone again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut hasn\u2019t he given you any of his papers to take care of?\u201D asked the\r\ncommissary.\r\n\r\n\u201COh no, indeed! I swear it. I\u2019d give them up to you at once if he had.\r\nI\u2019ve had quite enough of this, I can tell you! It\u2019s no joke to see you\r\ntossing all my things about and ferreting everywhere in this way. Oh!\r\nyou may look; there\u2019s nothing.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe officers, who examined every article of furniture, now wished to\r\nenter the little closet where Muche slept. The child had been awakened\r\nby the noise, and for the last few moments he had been crying bitterly,\r\nas though he imagined that he was going to be murdered.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is my boy\u2019s room,\u201D said La Normande, opening the door.\r\n\r\nMuche, quite naked, ran up and threw his arms round his mother\u2019s neck.\r\nShe pacified him, and laid him down in her own bed. The officers came\r\nout of the little room again almost immediately, and the commissary had\r\njust made up his mind to retire, when the child, still in tears,\r\nwhispered in his mother\u2019s ear: \u201CThey\u2019ll take my copy-books. Don\u2019t let\r\nthem have my copy-books.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes; that\u2019s true,\u201D cried La Normande; \u201Cthere are some copy-books.\r\nWait a moment, gentlemen, and I\u2019ll give them to you. I want you to see\r\nthat I\u2019m not hiding anything from you. Then, you\u2019ll find some of his\r\nwriting inside these. You\u2019re quite at liberty to hang him as far as I\u2019m\r\nconcerned; you won\u2019t find me trying to cut him down.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon she handed Muche\u2019s books and the copies set by Florent to the\r\ncommissary. But at this the boy sprang angrily out of bed, and began to\r\nscratch and bite his mother, who put him back again with a box on the\r\nears. Then he began to bellow.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the uproar, Mademoiselle Saget appeared on the\r\nthreshold, craning her neck forward. Finding all the doors open, she\r\nhad come in to offer her services to old Madame Mehudin. She spied\r\nabout and listened, and expressed extreme pity for these poor women,\r\nwho had no one to defend them. The commissary, however, had begun to\r\nread the copies with a grave air. The frequent repetition of such words\r\nas \u201Ctyrannically,\u201D \u201Cliberticide,\u201D \u201Cunconstitutional,\u201D and\r\n\u201Crevolutionary\u201D made him frown; and on reading the sentence, \u201CWhen the\r\nhour strikes, the guilty shall fall,\u201D he tapped his fingers on the\r\npaper and said: \u201CThis is very serious, very serious indeed.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon he gave the books to one of his men, and went off. Claire,\r\nwho had hitherto not shown herself, now opened her door, and watched\r\nthe police officers go down the stairs. And afterwards she came into\r\nher sister\u2019s bedroom, which she had not entered for a year.\r\nMademoiselle Saget appeared to be on the best of terms with La\r\nNormande, and was hanging over her in a caressing way, bringing the\r\nshawl forward to cover her the better, and listening to her angry\r\nindignation with an expression of the deepest sympathy.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou wretched coward!\u201D exclaimed Claire, planting herself in front of\r\nher sister.\r\n\r\nLa Normande sprang up, quivering with anger, and let the shawl fall to\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, you\u2019ve been playing the spy, have you?\u201D she screamed. \u201CDare to\r\nrepeat what you\u2019ve just said!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou wretched coward!\u201D repeated Claire, in still more insulting tones\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nThereupon La Normande struck Claire with all her force; and in return\r\nClaire, turning terribly pale, sprang upon her sister and dug her nails\r\ninto her neck. They struggled together for a moment or two, tearing at\r\neach other\u2019s hair and trying to choke one another. Claire, fragile\r\nthough she was, pushed La Normande backward with such tremendous\r\nviolence that they both fell against the wardrobe, smashing the mirror\r\non its front. Muche was roaring, and old Madame Mehudin called to\r\nMademoiselle Saget to come and help her separate the sisters. Claire,\r\nhowever, shook herself free.\r\n\r\n\u201CCoward! Coward!\u201D she cried; \u201CI\u2019ll go and tell the poor fellow that it\r\nis you who have betrayed him.\u201D\r\n\r\nHer mother, however, blocked the doorway, and would not let her pass,\r\nwhile La Normande seized her from behind, and then, Mademoiselle Saget\r\ncoming to the assistance of the other two, the three of them dragged\r\nClaire into her bedroom and locked the door upon her, in spite of all\r\nher frantic resistance. In her rage she tried to kick the door down,\r\nand smashed everything in the room. Soon afterwards, however, nothing\r\ncould be heard except a furious scratching, the sound of metal scarping\r\nat the plaster. The girl was trying to loosen the door hinges with the\r\npoints of her scissors.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe would have murdered me if she had had a knife,\u201D said La Normande,\r\nlooking about for her clothes, in order to dress herself. \u201CShe\u2019ll be\r\ndoing something dreadful, you\u2019ll see, one of these days, with that\r\njealousy of hers! We mustn\u2019t let her get out on any account: she\u2019d\r\nbring the whole neighbourhood down upon us!\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget went off in all haste. She reached the corner of the\r\nRue Pirouette just as the commissary of police was re-entering the side\r\npassage of the Quenu-Gradelles\u2019 house. She grasped the situation at\r\nonce, and entered the shop with such glistening eyes that Lisa enjoined\r\nsilence by a gesture which called her attention to the presence of\r\nQuenu, who was hanging up some pieces of salt pork. As soon as he had\r\nreturned to the kitchen, the old maid in a low voice described the\r\nscenes that had just taken place at the Mehudins\u2019. Lisa, as she bent\r\nover the counter, with her hand resting on a dish of larded veal,\r\nlistened to her with the happy face of one who triumphs. Then, as a\r\ncustomer entered the shop, and asked for a couple of pig\u2019s trotters,\r\nLisa wrapped them up, and handed them over with a thoughtful air.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor my own part, I bear La Normande no ill-will,\u201D she said to\r\nMademoiselle Saget, when they were alone again. \u201CI used to be very fond\r\nof her, and have always been sorry that other people made mischief\r\nbetween us. The proof that I\u2019ve no animosity against her is here in\r\nthis photograph, which I saved from falling into the hands of the\r\npolice, and which I\u2019m quite ready to give her back if she will come and\r\nask me for it herself.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe took the photograph out of her pocket as she spoke. Mademoiselle\r\nSaget scrutinised it and sniggered as she read the inscription,\r\n\u201CLouise, to her dear friend Florent.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll be acting wisely,\u201D she said in her cutting voice.\r\n\u201CYou\u2019d do better to keep it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no,\u201D replied Lisa; \u201CI\u2019m anxious for all this silly nonsense to\r\ncome to an end. To-day is the day of reconciliation. We\u2019ve had enough\r\nunpleasantness, and the neighbourhood\u2019s now going to be quiet and\r\npeaceful again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, well, shall I go and tell La Normande that you are expecting\r\nher?\u201D asked the old maid.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; I shall be very glad if you will.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget then made her way back to the Rue Pirouette, and\r\ngreatly frightened the fish-girl by telling her that she had just seen\r\nher photograph in Lisa\u2019s pocket. She could not, however, at once\r\nprevail upon her to comply with her rival\u2019s terms. La Normande\r\npropounded conditions of her own. She would go, but Madame Quenu must\r\ncome to the door of the shop to receive her. Thus the old maid was\r\nobliged to make another couple of journeys between the two rivals\r\nbefore their meeting could be satisfactorily arranged. At last,\r\nhowever, to her great delight, she succeeded in negotiating the peace\r\nwhich was destined to cause so much talk and excitement. As she passed\r\nClaire\u2019s door for the last time she still heard the sound of the\r\nscissors scraping away at the plaster.\r\n\r\nWhen she had at last carried a definite reply to Madame Quenu,\r\nMademoiselle Saget hurried off to find Madame Lec\u0153ur and La Sarriette;\r\nand all three of them took up their position on the footway at the\r\ncorner of the fish market, just in front of the pork shop. Here they\r\nwould be certain to have a good view of every detail of the meeting.\r\nThey felt extremely impatient, and while pretending to chat together\r\nkept an anxious look-out in the direction of the Rue Pirouette, along\r\nwhich La Normande must come. The news of the reconciliation was already\r\ntravelling through the markets, and while some saleswomen stood up\r\nbehind their stalls trying to get a view of what was taking place,\r\nothers, still more inquisitive, actually left their places and took up\r\na position in the covered way. Every eye in the markets was directed\r\nupon the pork shop; the whole neighbourhood was on the tip-toe of\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nIt was a very solemn affair. When La Normande at last turned the corner\r\nof the Rue Pirouette the excitement was so great that the women held\r\ntheir breath.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe has got her diamonds on,\u201D murmured La Sarriette.\r\n\r\n\u201CJust look how she stalks along,\u201D added Madame Lec\u0153ur; \u201Cthe stuck-up\r\ncreature!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Norman was, indeed, advancing with the mien of a queen\r\nwho condescends to make peace. She had made a most careful toilet,\r\nfrizzing her hair and turning up a corner of her apron to display her\r\ncashmere skirt. She had even put on a new and rich lace bow. Conscious\r\nthat the whole market was staring at her, she assumed a still haughtier\r\nair as she approached the pork shop. When she reached the door she\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow it\u2019s beautiful Lisa\u2019s turn,\u201D remarked Mademoiselle Saget. \u201CMind\r\nyou pay attention.\u201D\r\n\r\nBeautiful Lisa smilingly quitted her counter. She crossed the\r\nshop-floor at a leisurely pace, and came and offered her hand to the\r\nbeautiful Norman. She also was smartly dressed, with her dazzling linen\r\nand scrupulous neatness. A murmur ran through the crowd of fish-wives,\r\nall their heads gathered close together, and animated chatter ensued.\r\nThe two women had gone inside the shop, and the _crepines_ in the\r\nwindow prevented them from being clearly seen. However, they seemed to\r\nbe conversing affectionately, addressing pretty compliments to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\u201CSee!\u201D suddenly exclaimed Mademoiselle Saget, \u201Cthe beautiful Norman\u2019s\r\nbuying something! What is it she\u2019s buying? It\u2019s a chitterling, I\r\nbelieve! Ah! Look! look! You didn\u2019t see it, did you? Well, beautiful\r\nLisa just gave her the photograph; she slipped it into her hand with\r\nthe chitterling.\u201D\r\n\r\nFresh salutations were then seen to pass between the two women; and the\r\nbeautiful Lisa, exceeding even the courtesies which had been agreed\r\nupon, accompanied the beautiful Norman to the footway. There they stood\r\nlaughing together, exhibiting themselves to the neighbourhood like a\r\ncouple of good friends. The markets were quite delighted; and the\r\nsaleswomen returned to their stalls, declaring that everything had\r\npassed off extremely well.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget, however, detained Madame Lec\u0153ur and La Sarriette.\r\nThe drama was not over yet. All three kept their eyes fixed on the\r\nhouse opposite with such keen curiosity that they seemed trying to\r\npenetrate the very walls. To pass the time away they once more began to\r\ntalk of the beautiful Norman.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s without a lover now,\u201D remarked Madame Lec\u0153ur.\r\n\r\n\u201COh! she\u2019s got Monsieur Lebigre,\u201D replied La Sarriette, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut surely Monsieur Lebigre won\u2019t have anything more to say to her.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget shrugged her shoulders. \u201CAh, you don\u2019t know him,\u201D\r\nshe said. \u201CHe won\u2019t care a straw about all this business. He knows what\r\nhe\u2019s about, and La Normande is rich. They\u2019ll come together in a couple\r\nof months, you\u2019ll see. Old Madame Mehudin\u2019s been scheming to bring\r\nabout their marriage for a long time past.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, anyway,\u201D retorted the butter dealer, \u201Cthe commissary found\r\nFlorent at her lodgings.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, indeed; I\u2019m sure I never told you that. The long\r\nspindle-shanks had gone way,\u201D replied the old maid. She paused to take\r\na breath; then resumed in an indignant tone, \u201CWhat distressed me most\r\nwas to hear of all the abominable things that the villain had taught\r\nlittle Muche. You\u2019d really never believe it. There was a whole bundle\r\nof papers.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat sort of abominable things?\u201D asked La Sarriette with interest.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, all kinds of filth. The commissary said there was quite sufficient\r\nthere to hang him. The fellow\u2019s a perfect monster! To go and demoralise\r\na child! Why, it\u2019s almost past believing! Little Muche is certainly a\r\nscamp, but that\u2019s no reason why he should be given over to the \u2018Reds,\u2019\r\nis it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly not,\u201D assented the two others.\r\n\r\n\u201CHowever, all these mysterious goings-on will come to an end now. You\r\nremember my telling you once that there was some strange goings-on at\r\nthe Quenus\u2019? Well, you see, I was right in my conclusions, wasn\u2019t I?\r\nThank God, however, the neighbourhood will now be able to breathe\r\neasily. It was high time strong steps were taken, for things had got to\r\nsuch a pitch that one actually felt afraid of being murdered in broad\r\ndaylight. There was no pleasure in life. All the dreadful stories and\r\nreports one heard were enough to worry one to death. And it was all\r\nowing to that man, that dreadful Florent. Now beautiful Lisa and the\r\nbeautiful Norman have sensibly made friends again. It was their duty to\r\ndo so for the sake of the peace and quietness of us all. Everything\r\nwill go on satisfactorily now, you\u2019ll find. Ah! there\u2019s poor Monsieur\r\nQuenu laughing yonder!\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu had again come on to the footway, and was joking with Madame\r\nTaboureau\u2019s little servant. He seemed quite gay and skittish that\r\nmorning. He took hold of the little servant\u2019s hands, and squeezed her\r\nfingers so tightly, in the exuberance of his spirits, that he made her\r\ncry out. Lisa had the greatest trouble to get him to go back into the\r\nkitchen. She was impatiently pacing about the shop, fearing lest\r\nFlorent should make his appearance; and she called to her husband to\r\ncome away, dreading a meeting between him and his brother.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s getting quite vexed,\u201D said Mademoiselle Saget. \u201CPoor Monsieur\r\nQuenu, you see, knows nothing at all about what\u2019s taking place. Just\r\nlook at him there, laughing like a child! Madame Taboureau, you know,\r\nsaid that she should have nothing more to do with the Quenus if they\r\npersisted in bringing themselves into discredit by keeping that Florent\r\nwith them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, now, I suppose, they will stick to the fortune,\u201D remarked Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, no, indeed, my dear. The other one has had his share already.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CReally? How do you know that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, it\u2019s clear enough, that is!\u201D replied the old maid after a\r\nmomentary hesitation, but without giving any proof of her assertions.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s had even more than his share. The Quenus will be several thousand\r\nfrancs out of pocket. Money flies, you know, when a man has such vices\r\nas he has. I dare say you don\u2019t know that there was another woman mixed\r\nup in it all. Yes, indeed, old Madame Verlaque, the wife of the former\r\ninspector; you know the sallow-faced thing well enough.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe others protested that it surely wasn\u2019t possible. Why, Madame\r\nVerlaque was positively hideous!\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat! do you think me a liar?\u201D cried Mademoiselle Saget, with angry\r\nindignation. \u201CWhy, her letters to him have been found, a whole pile of\r\nletters, in which she asks for money, ten and twenty francs at a time.\r\nThere\u2019s no doubt at all about it. I\u2019m quite certain in my own mind that\r\nthey killed the husband between them.\u201D\r\n\r\nLa Sarriette and Madame Lec\u0153ur were convinced; but they were beginning\r\nto get very impatient. They had been waiting on the footway for more\r\nthan an hour, and feared that somebody might be robbing their stalls\r\nduring their long absence. So Mademoiselle Saget began to give them\r\nsome further interesting information to keep them from going off.\r\nFlorent could not have taken to flight, said she; he was certain to\r\nreturn, and it would be very interesting to see him arrested. Then she\r\nwent on to describe the trap that had been laid for him, while Madame\r\nLec\u0153ur and La Sarriette continued scrutinising the house from top to\r\nbottom, keeping watch upon every opening, and at each moment expecting\r\nto see the hats of the detectives appear at one of the doors or\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho would ever imagine, now, that the place was full of police?\u201D\r\nobserved the butter dealer.\r\n\r\n\u201COh! they\u2019re in the garret at the top,\u201D said the old maid. \u201CThey\u2019ve\r\nleft the window open, you see, just as they found it. Look! I think I\r\ncan see one of them hiding behind the pomegranate on the balcony.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe others excitedly craned out their necks, but could see nothing.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, no, it\u2019s only a shadow,\u201D continued Mademoiselle Saget. \u201CThe little\r\ncurtains even are perfectly still. The detectives must be sitting down\r\nin the room, and keeping quiet.\u201D\r\n\r\nJust at that moment the women caught sight of Gavard coming out of the\r\nfish market with a thoughtful air. They looked at him with glistening\r\neyes, without speaking. They had drawn close to one another, and stood\r\nthere rigid in their drooping skirts. The poultry dealer came up to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you seen Florent go by?\u201D he asked.\r\n\r\nThey replied that they had not.\r\n\r\n\u201CI want to speak to him at once,\u201D continued Gavard. \u201CHe isn\u2019t in the\r\nfish market. He must have gone up to his room. But you would have seen\r\nhim, though, if he had.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe women had turned rather pale. They still kept looking at each other\r\nwith a knowing expression, their lips twitching slightly every now and\r\nthen. \u201CWe have only been here some five minutes, said Madame Lec\u0153ur\r\nunblushingly, as her brother-in-law still stood hesitating.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, then, I\u2019ll go upstairs and see. I\u2019ll risk the five flights,\u201D\r\nrejoined Gavard with a laugh.\r\n\r\nLa Sarriette stepped forward as though she wished to detain him, but\r\nher aunt took hold of her arm and drew her back.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet him alone, you big simpleton!\u201D she whispered. \u201CIt\u2019s the best thing\r\nthat can happen to him. It\u2019ll teach him to treat us with respect in\r\nfuture.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe won\u2019t say again that I ate tainted meat,\u201D muttered Mademoiselle\r\nSaget in a low tone.\r\n\r\nThey said nothing more. La Sarriette was very red; but the two others\r\nstill remained quite yellow. But they now averted their heads, feeling\r\nconfused by each other\u2019s looks, and at a loss what to do with their\r\nhands, which they buried beneath their aprons. Presently their eyes\r\ninstinctively came back to the house, penetrating the walls, as it\r\nwere, following Gavard in his progress up the stairs. When they\r\nimagined that he had entered Florent\u2019s room they again exchanged\r\nfurtive glances. La Sarriette laughed nervously. All at once they\r\nfancied they could see the window curtains moving, and this led them to\r\nbelieve that a struggle was taking place. But the house-front remained\r\nas tranquil as ever in the sunshine; and another quarter of an hour of\r\nunbroken quietness passed away, during which the three women\u2019s nervous\r\nexcitement became more and more intense. They were beginning to feel\r\nquite faint when a man hurriedly came out of the passage and ran off to\r\nget a cab. Five minutes later Gavard appeared, followed by two police\r\nofficers. Lisa, who had stepped out on to the footway on observing the\r\ncab, hastily hurried back into the shop.\r\n\r\nGavard was very pale. The police had searched him upstairs, and had\r\ndiscovered the revolver and cartridge case in his possession. Judging\r\nby the commissary\u2019s stern expression on hearing his name, the poultry\r\ndealer deemed himself lost. This was a terrible ending to his plotting\r\nthat had never entered into his calculations. The Tuileries would never\r\nforgive him! His legs gave way beneath him as though the firing party\r\nwas already awaiting him outside. When he got into the street, however,\r\nhis vanity lent him sufficient strength to walk erect; and he even\r\nmanaged to force a smile, as he knew the market people were looking at\r\nhim. They should see him die bravely, he resolved.\r\n\r\nHowever, La Sarriette and Madame Lec\u0153ur rushed up to him and anxiously\r\ninquired what was the matter; and the butter dealer began to cry, while\r\nLa Sarriette embraced her uncle, manifesting the deepest emotion. As\r\nGavard held her clasped in his arms, he slipped a key into her hand,\r\nand whispered in her ear: \u201CTake everything, and burn the papers.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he got into the cab with the same mien as he would have ascended\r\nthe scaffold. As the vehicle disappeared round the corner of the Rue\r\nPierre Lescot, Madame Lec\u0153ur observed La Sarriette trying to hide the\r\nkey in her pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s of no use you trying that little game on me, my dear,\u201D she\r\nexclaimed, clenching her teeth; \u201CI saw him slip it into your hand. As\r\ntrue as there\u2019s a God in Heaven, I\u2019ll go to the gaol and tell him\r\neverything, if you don\u2019t treat me properly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf course I shall treat you properly, aunt, dear,\u201D replied La\r\nSarriette, with an embarrassed smile.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well, then, let us go to his rooms at once. It\u2019s of no use to\r\ngive the police time to poke their dirty hands in the cupboards.\u201D\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Saget, who had been listening with gleaming eyes, followed\r\nthem, running along in the rear as quickly as her short legs could\r\ncarry her. She had no thought, now, of waiting for Florent. From the\r\nRue Rambuteau to the Rue de la Cossonnerie she manifested the most\r\nhumble obsequiousness, and volunteered to explain matters to Madame\r\nLeonce, the doorkeeper.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see,\u201D the butter dealer curtly replied.\r\n\r\nHowever, on reaching the house a preliminary parley\u2014as Mademoiselle\r\nSaget had opined\u2014proved to be necessary. Madame Leonce refused to allow\r\nthe women to go up to her tenant\u2019s room. She put on an expression of\r\nsevere austerity, and seemed greatly shocked by the sight of La\r\nSarriette\u2019s loosely fastened fichu. However, after the old maid had\r\nwhispered a few words to her and she was shown the key, she gave way.\r\nWhen they got upstairs she surrendered the rooms and furniture to the\r\nothers article by article, apparently as heartbroken as if she had been\r\ncompelled to show a party of burglars the place where her own money was\r\nsecreted.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere, take everything and have done with it!\u201D she cried at last,\r\nthrowing herself into an arm-chair.\r\n\r\nLa Sarriette was already eagerly trying the key in the locks of\r\ndifferent closets. Madame Lec\u0153ur, all suspicion, pressed her so closely\r\nthat she exclaimed: \u201CReally, aunt, you get in my way. Do leave my arms\r\nfree, at any rate.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt last they succeeded in opening a wardrobe opposite the window,\r\nbetween the fireplace and the bed. And then all four women broke into\r\nexclamations. On the middle shelf lay some ten thousand francs in gold,\r\nmethodically arranged in little piles. Gavard, who had prudently\r\ndeposited the bulk of his fortune in the hands of a notary, had kept\r\nthis sum by him for the purposes of the coming outbreak. He had been\r\nwont to say with great solemnity that his contribution to the\r\nrevolution was quite ready. The fact was that he had sold out certain\r\nstock, and every night took an intense delight in contemplating those\r\nten thousand francs, gloating over them, and finding something quite\r\nroysterous and insurrectional in their appearance. Sometimes when he\r\nwas in bed he dreamed that a fight was going on in the wardrobe; he\r\ncould hear guns being fired there, paving-stones being torn up and\r\npiled into barricades, and voices shouting in clamorous triumph; and he\r\nsaid to himself that it was his money fighting against the Government.\r\n\r\nLa Sarriette, however, had stretched out her hands with a cry of\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\u201CPaws off, little one!\u201D exclaimed Madame Lec\u0153ur in a hoarse voice.\r\n\r\nAs she stood there in the reflection of the gold, she looked yellower\r\nthan ever\u2014her face discoloured by biliousness, her eyes glowing\r\nfeverishly from the liver complaint which was secretly undermining her.\r\nBehind her Mademoiselle Saget on tip-toe was gazing ecstatically into\r\nthe wardrobe, and Madame Leonce had now risen from her seat, and was\r\ngrowling sulkily.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy uncle said I was to take everything,\u201D declared the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd am I to have nothing, then; I who have done so much for him?\u201D\r\ncried the doorkeeper.\r\n\r\nMadame Lec\u0153ur was almost choking with excitement. She pushed the others\r\naway, and clung hold of the wardrobe, screaming: \u201CIt all belongs to me!\r\nI am his nearest relative. You are a pack of thieves, you are! I\u2019d\r\nrather throw it all out of the window than see you have it!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen silence fell, and they all four stood glowering at each other. The\r\nkerchief that La Sarriette wore over her breast was now altogether\r\nunfastened, and she displayed her bosom heaving with warm life, her\r\nmoist red lips, her rosy nostrils. Madame Lec\u0153ur grew still more sour\r\nas she saw how lovely the girl looked in the excitement of her longing\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D she said in a lower tone, \u201Cwe won\u2019t fight about it. You are his\r\nniece, and I\u2019ll divide the money with you. We will each take a pile in\r\nturn.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon they pushed the other two aside. The butter dealer took the\r\nfirst pile, which at once disappeared within her skirts. Then La\r\nSarriette took a pile. They kept a close watch upon one another, ready\r\nto fight at the slightest attempt at cheating. Their fingers were\r\nthrust forward in turn, the hideous knotted fingers of the aunt and the\r\nwhite fingers of the niece, soft and supple as silk. Slowly they filled\r\ntheir pockets. When there was only one pile left, La Sarriette objected\r\nto her aunt taking it, as she had commenced; and she suddenly divided\r\nit between Mademoiselle Saget and Madame Leonce, who had watched them\r\npocket the gold with feverish impatience.\r\n\r\n\u201CMuch obliged to you!\u201D snarled the doorkeeper. \u201CFifty francs for having\r\ncoddled him up with tisane and broth! The old deceiver told me he had\r\nno relatives!\u201D\r\n\r\nBefore locking the wardrobe up again, Madame Lec\u0153ur searched it\r\nthoroughly from top to bottom. It contained all the political works\r\nwhich were forbidden admission into the country, the pamphlets printed\r\nat Brussels, the scandalous histories of the Bonapartes, and the\r\nforeign caricatures ridiculing the Emperor. One of Gavard\u2019s greatest\r\ndelights was to shut himself up with a friend, and show him all these\r\ncompromising things.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe told me that I was to burn all the papers,\u201D said La Sarriette.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, nonsense! we\u2019ve no fire, and it would take up too long. The police\r\nwill soon be here! We must get out of this!\u201D\r\n\r\nThey all four hastened off; but they had not reached the bottom of the\r\nstairs before the police met them, and made Madame Leonce return with\r\nthem upstairs. The three others, making themselves as small as\r\npossible, hurriedly escaped into the street. They walked away in single\r\nfile at a brisk pace; the aunt and niece considerably incommoded by the\r\nweight of their drooping pockets. Mademoiselle Saget had kept her fifty\r\nfrancs in her closed fist, and remained deep in thought, brooding over\r\na plan for extracting something more from the heavy pockets in front of\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D she exclaimed, as they reached the corner of the fish market,\r\n\u201Cwe\u2019ve got here at a lucky moment. There\u2019s Florent yonder, just going\r\nto walk into the trap.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent, indeed, was just then returning to the markets after his\r\nprolonged perambulation. He went into his office to change his coat,\r\nand then set about his daily duties, seeing that the marble slabs were\r\nproperly washed, and slowly strolling along the alleys. He fancied that\r\nthe fish-wives looked at him in a somewhat strange manner; they\r\nchuckled too, and smiled significantly as he passed them. Some new\r\nvexation, he thought, was in store for him. For some time past those\r\nhuge, terrible women had not allowed him a day\u2019s peace. However, as he\r\npassed the Mehudins\u2019 stall he was very much surprised to hear the old\r\nwoman address him in a honeyed tone: \u201CThere\u2019s just been a gentleman\r\ninquiring for you, Monsieur Florent; a middle-aged gentleman. He\u2019s gone\r\nto wait for you in your room.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs the old fish-wife, who was squatting, all of a heap, on her chair,\r\nspoke these words, she felt such a delicious thrill of satisfied\r\nvengeance that her huge body fairly quivered. Florent, still doubtful,\r\nglanced at the beautiful Norman; but the young woman, now completely\r\nreconciled with her mother, turned on her tap and slapped her fish,\r\npretending not to hear what was being said.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are quite sure?\u201D said Florent to Mother Mehudin.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes, indeed. Isn\u2019t that so, Louise?\u201D said the old woman in a\r\nshriller voice.\r\n\r\nFlorent concluded that it must be some one who wanted to see him about\r\nthe great business, and he resolved to go up to his room. He was just\r\nabout to leave the pavilion, when, happening to turn round, he observed\r\nthe beautiful Norman watching him with a grave expression on her face.\r\nThen he passed in front of the three gossips.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you notice that there\u2019s no one in the pork shop?\u201D remarked\r\nMademoiselle Saget. \u201CBeautiful Lisa\u2019s not the woman to compromise\r\nherself.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe shop was, indeed, quite empty. The front of the house was still\r\nbright with sunshine; the building looked like some honest, prosperous\r\npile guilelessly warming itself in the morning rays. Up above, the\r\npomegranate on the balcony was in full bloom. As Florent crossed the\r\nroadway he gave a friendly nod to Logre and Monsieur Lebigre, who\r\nappeared to be enjoying the fresh air on the doorstep of the latter\u2019s\r\nestablishment. They returned his greeting with a smile. Florent was\r\nthen about to enter the side-passage, when he fancied he saw Auguste\u2019s\r\npale face hastily vanishing from its dark and narrow depths. Thereupon\r\nhe turned back and glanced into the shop to make sure that the\r\nmiddle-aged gentleman was not waiting for him there. But he saw no one\r\nbut Mouton, who sat on a block displaying his double chin and bristling\r\nwhiskers, and gazed at him defiantly with his great yellow eyes. And\r\nwhen he had at last made up his mind to enter the passage, Lisa\u2019s face\r\nappeared behind the little curtain of a glazed door at the back of the\r\nshop.\r\n\r\nA hush had fallen over the fish market. All the huge paunches and\r\nbosoms held their breath, waiting till Florent should disappear from\r\nsight. Then there was an uproarious outbreak; and the bosoms heaved\r\nwildly and the paunches nearly burst with malicious delight. The joke\r\nhad succeeded. Nothing could be more comical. As old Mother Mehudin\r\nvented her merriment she shook and quivered like a wine-skin that is\r\nbeing emptied. Her story of the middle-aged gentleman went the round of\r\nthe market, and the fish-wives found it extremely amusing. At last the\r\nlong spindle-shanks was collared, and they would no longer always have\r\nhis miserable face and gaol-bird\u2019s expression before their eyes. They\r\nall wished him a pleasant journey, and trusted that they might get a\r\nhandsome fellow for their next inspector. And in their delight they\r\nrushed about from one stall to another, and felt inclined to dance\r\nround their marble slabs like a lot of holiday-making schoolgirls. The\r\nbeautiful Norman, however, watched this outbreak of joy in a rigid\r\nattitude, not daring to move for fear she should burst into tears; and\r\nshe kept her hands pressed upon a big skate to cool her feverish\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou see how those Mehudins turn their backs upon him now that he\u2019s\r\ncome to grief,\u201D said Madame Lec\u0153ur.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, and they\u2019re quite right too,\u201D replied Mademoiselle Saget.\r\n\u201CBesides, matters are settled now, my dear, and we\u2019re to have no more\r\ndisputes. You\u2019ve every reason to be satisfied; leave the others to act\r\nas they please.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s only the old woman who is laughing,\u201D La Sarriette remarked; \u201CLa\r\nNormande looks anything but happy.\u201D\r\n\r\nMeantime, upstairs in his bedroom, Florent allowed himself to be taken\r\nas unresistingly as a sheep. The police officers sprang roughly upon\r\nhim, expecting, no doubt, that they would meet with a desperate\r\nresistance. He quietly begged them to leave go of him; and then sat\r\ndown on a chair while they packed up his papers, and the red scarves,\r\narmlets, and banners. He did not seem at all surprised at this ending;\r\nindeed, it was something of a relief to him, though he would not\r\nfrankly confess it. But he suffered acutely at thought of the bitter\r\nhatred which had sent him into that room; he recalled Auguste\u2019s pale\r\nface and the sniggering looks of the fish-wives; he bethought himself\r\nof old Madame Mehudin\u2019s words, La Normande\u2019s silence, and the empty\r\nshop downstairs. The markets were leagued against him, he reflected;\r\nthe whole neighbourhood had conspired to hand him over to the police.\r\nThe mud of those greasy streets had risen up all around to overwhelm\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nAnd amidst all the round faces which flitted before his mind\u2019s eye\r\nthere suddenly appeared that of Quenu, and a spasm of mortal agony\r\ncontracted his heart.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, get along downstairs!\u201D exclaimed one of the officers, roughly.\r\n\r\nFlorent rose and proceeded to go downstairs. When he reached the second\r\nfloor he asked to be allowed to return; he had forgotten something, he\r\nsaid. But the officers refused to let him go back, and began to hustle\r\nhim forward. Then he besought them to let him return to his room again,\r\nand even offered them the money he had in his pocket. Two of them at\r\nlast consented to return with him, threatening to blow his brains out\r\nshould he attempt to play them any trick; and they drew their revolvers\r\nout of their pockets as they spoke. However, on reaching his room once\r\nmore Florent simply went straight to the chaffinch\u2019s cage, took the\r\nbird out of it, kissed it between its wings, and set it at liberty. He\r\nwatched it fly away through the open window, into the sunshine, and\r\nalight, as though giddy, on the roof of the fish market. Then it flew\r\noff again and disappeared over the markets in the direction of the\r\nSquare des Innocents. For a moment longer Florent remained face to face\r\nwith the sky, the free and open sky; and he thought of the wood-pigeons\r\ncooing in the garden of the Tuileries, and of those other pigeons down\r\nin the market cellars with their throats slit by Marjolin\u2019s knife. Then\r\nhe felt quite broken, and turned and followed the officers, who were\r\nputting their revolvers back into their pockets as they shrugged their\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the bottom of the stairs, Florent stopped before the door\r\nwhich led into the kitchen. The commissary, who was waiting for him\r\nthere, seemed almost touched by his gentle submissiveness, and asked\r\nhim: \u201CWould you like to say good-bye to your brother?\u201D\r\n\r\nFor a moment Florent hesitated. He looked at the door. A tremendous\r\nnoise of cleavers and pans came from the kitchen. Lisa, with the design\r\nof keeping her husband occupied, had persuaded him to make the\r\nblack-puddings in the morning instead of in the evening, as was his\r\nwont. The onions were simmering on the fire, and over all the noisy\r\nuproar Florent could hear Quenu\u2019s joyous voice exclaiming, \u201CAh, dash it\r\nall, the pudding will be excellent, that it will! Auguste, hand me the\r\nfat!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorent thanked the commissary, but refused his offer. He was afraid to\r\nreturn any more into that warm kitchen, reeking with the odour of\r\nboiling onions, and so he went on past the door, happy in the thought\r\nthat his brother knew nothing of what had happened to him, and\r\nhastening his steps as if to spare the establishment all further worry.\r\nHowever, on emerging into the open sunshine of the street he felt a\r\ntouch of shame, and got into the cab with bent back and ashen face. He\r\nwas conscious that the fish market was gazing at him in triumph; it\r\nseemed to him, indeed, as though the whole neighbourhood had gathered\r\nthere to rejoice at his fall.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a villainous expression he\u2019s got!\u201D said Mademoiselle Saget.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, indeed, he looks just like a thief caught with his hand in\r\nsomebody\u2019s till,\u201D added Madame Lec\u0153ur.\r\n\r\n\u201CI once saw a man guillotined who looked exactly like he does,\u201D\r\nasserted La Sarriette, showing her white teeth.\r\n\r\nThey stepped forward, lengthened their necks, and tried to see into the\r\ncab. Just as it was starting, however, the old maid tugged sharply at\r\nthe skirts of her companions, and pointed to Claire, who was coming\r\nround the corner of the Rue Pirouette, looking like a mad creature,\r\nwith her hair loose and her nails bleeding. She had at last succeeded\r\nin opening her door. When she discovered that she was too late, and\r\nthat Florent was being taken off, she darted after the cab, but checked\r\nherself almost immediately with a gesture of impotent rage, and shook\r\nher fists at the receding wheels. Then, with her face quite crimson\r\nbeneath the fine plaster dust with which she was covered, she ran back\r\nagain towards the Rue Pirouette.\r\n\r\n\u201CHad he promised to marry her, eh?\u201D exclaimed La Sarriette, laughing.\r\n\u201CThe silly fool must be quite cracked.\u201D\r\n\r\nLittle by little the neighbourhood calmed down, though throughout the\r\nday groups of people constantly assembled and discussed the events of\r\nthe morning. The pork shop was the object of much inquisitive\r\ncuriosity. Lisa avoided appearing there, and left the counter in charge\r\nof Augustine. In the afternoon she felt bound to tell Quenu of what had\r\nhappened, for fear the news might cause him too great a shock should he\r\nhear it from some gossiping neighbour. She waited till she was alone\r\nwith him in the kitchen, knowing that there he was always most\r\ncheerful, and would weep less than if he were anywhere else. Moreover,\r\nshe communicated her tidings with all sorts of motherly precautions.\r\nNevertheless, as soon as he knew the truth he fell on the\r\nchopping-block, and began to cry like a calf.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, now, my poor dear, don\u2019t give way like that; you\u2019ll make yourself\r\nquite ill,\u201D exclaimed Lisa, taking him in her arms.\r\n\r\nHis tears were inundating his white apron, the whole of his massive,\r\ntorpid form quivered with grief. He seemed to be sinking, melting away.\r\nWhen he was at last able to speak, he stammered: \u201COh, you don\u2019t know\r\nhow good he was to me when we lived together in the Rue Royer-Collard!\r\nHe did everything. He swept the room and cooked the meals. He loved me\r\nas though I were his own child; and after his day\u2019s work he used to\r\ncome back splashed with mud, and so tired that he could scarcely move,\r\nwhile I stayed warm and comfortable in the house, and had nothing to do\r\nbut eat. And now they\u2019re going to shoot him!\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this Lisa protested, saying that he would certainly not be shot. But\r\nQuenu only shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201CI haven\u2019t loved him half as much as I ought to have done,\u201D he\r\ncontinued. \u201CI can see that very well now. I had a wicked heart, and I\r\nhesitated about giving him his half of the money.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, I offered it to him a dozen times and more!\u201D Lisa interrupted.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure we\u2019ve nothing to reproach ourselves with.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes, I know that you are everything that is good, and that you\r\nwould have given him every copper. But I hesitated, I didn\u2019t like to\r\npart with it; and now it will be a sorrow to me for the rest of my\r\nlife. I shall always think that if I\u2019d shared the fortune with him he\r\nwouldn\u2019t have gone wrong a second time. Oh, yes; it\u2019s my fault! It is I\r\nwho have driven him to this.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Lisa, expostulating still more gently, assured him that he had\r\nnothing to blame himself for, and even expressed some pity for Florent.\r\nBut he was really very culpable, she said, and if he had had more money\r\nhe would probably have perpetrated greater follies. Gradually she gave\r\nher husband to understand that it was impossible matters could have had\r\nany other termination, and that now everything would go on much better.\r\nQuenu was still weeping, wiping his cheeks with his apron, trying to\r\nsuppress his sobs to listen to her, and then breaking into a wilder fit\r\nof tears than before. His fingers had mechanically sought a heap of\r\nsausage-meat lying on the block, and he was digging holes in it, and\r\nroughly kneading it together.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd how unwell you were feeling, you know,\u201D Lisa continued. \u201CIt was\r\nall because our life had got so shifted out of its usual course. I was\r\nvery anxious, though I didn\u2019t tell you so, at seeing you getting so\r\nlow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, wasn\u2019t I?\u201D he murmured, ceasing to sob for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd the business has been quite under a cloud this year. It was as\r\nthough a spell had been cast on it. Come, now, don\u2019t take on so; you\u2019ll\r\nsee that everything will look up again now. You must take care of\r\nyourself, you know, for my sake and your daughter\u2019s. You have duties to\r\nus as well as to others, remember.\u201D\r\n\r\nQuenu was now kneading the sausage-meat more gently. Another burst of\r\nemotion was thrilling him, but it was a softer emotion, which was\r\nalready bringing a vague smile to his grief-stricken face. Lisa felt\r\nthat she had convinced him, and she turned and called to Pauline, who\r\nwas playing in the shop, and sat her on Quenu\u2019s knee.\r\n\r\n\u201CTell your father, Pauline, that he ought not to give way like this.\r\nAsk him nicely not to go on distressing us so.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe child did as she was told, and their fat, sleek forms united in a\r\ngeneral embrace. They all three looked at one another, already feeling\r\ncured of that twelve months\u2019 depression from which they had but just\r\nemerged. Their big, round faces smiled, and Lisa softly repeated, \u201CAnd\r\nafter all, my dear, there are only we three, you know, only we three.\u201D\r\n\r\nTwo months later Florent was again sentenced to transportation. The\r\naffair caused a great stir. The newspapers published all possible\r\ndetails, and gave portraits of the accused, sketches of the banners and\r\nscarves, and plans of the places where the conspirators had met. For a\r\nfortnight nothing but the great plot of the central markets was talked\r\nof in Paris. The police kept on launching more and more alarming\r\nreports, and it was at last even declared that the whole of the\r\nMontmartre Quarter was undermined. The excitement in the Corps\r\nL\u00E9gislatif was so intense that the members of the Centre and the Right\r\nforgot their temporary disagreement over the Imperial Grant Bill, and\r\nbecame reconciled. And then by an overwhelming majority they voted the\r\nunpopular tax, of which even the lower classes, in the panic which was\r\nsweeping over the city, dared no longer complain.\r\n\r\nThe trial lasted a week. Florent was very much surprised at the number\r\nof accomplices with which he found himself credited. Out of the twenty\r\nand more who were placed in the dock with him, he knew only some six or\r\nseven. After the sentence of the court had been read, he fancied he\r\ncould see Robine\u2019s innocent-looking hat and back going off quietly\r\nthrough the crowd. Logre was acquitted, as was also Lacaille; Alexandre\r\nwas sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment for his child-like complicity\r\nin the conspiracy; while as for Gavard, he, like Florent, was condemned\r\nto transportation. This was a heavy blow, which quite crushed him\r\namidst the final enjoyment that he derived from those lengthy\r\nproceedings in which he had managed to make himself so conspicuous. He\r\nwas paying very dearly for the way in which he had vented the spirit of\r\nperpetual opposition peculiar to the Paris shopkeeping classes. Two big\r\ntears coursed down his scared face\u2014the face of a white-haired child.\r\n\r\nAnd then one morning in August, amidst the busy awakening of the\r\nmarkets, Claude Lantier, sauntering about in the thick of the arriving\r\nvegetables, with his waist tightly girded by his red sash, came to\r\ngrasp Madame Francois\u2019s hand close by Saint Eustache. She was sitting\r\non her carrots and turnips, and her long face looked very sad. The\r\nartist, too, was gloomy, notwithstanding the bright sun which was\r\nalready softening the deep-green velvet of the mountains of cabbages.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, it\u2019s all over now,\u201D he said. \u201CThey are sending him back again.\r\nHe\u2019s already on his way to Brest, I believe.\u201D\r\n\r\nMadame Francois made a gesture of mute grief. Then she gently waved her\r\nhand around, and murmured in a low voice; \u201CAh, it is all Paris\u2019s doing,\r\nthis villainous Paris!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, not quite that; but I know whose doing it is, the contemptible\r\ncreatures!\u201D exclaimed Claude, clenching his fists. \u201CDo you know, Madame\r\nFrancois, there was nothing too ridiculous for those fellows in the\r\ncourt to say! Why, they even went ferreting in a child\u2019s copy-books!\r\nThat great idiot of a Public Prosecutor made a tremendous fuss over\r\nthem, and ranted about the respect due to children, and the wickedness\r\nof demagogical education! It makes me quite sick to think of it all!\u201D\r\n\r\nA shudder of disgust shook him, and then, burying himself more deeply\r\nin his discoloured cloak, he resumed: \u201CTo think of it! A man who was as\r\ngentle as a girl! Why, I saw him turn quite faint at seeing a pigeon\r\nkilled! I couldn\u2019t help smiling with pity when I saw him between two\r\ngendarmes. Ah, well, we shall never see him again! He won\u2019t come back\r\nthis time.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe ought to have listened to me,\u201D said Madame Francois, after a pause,\r\n\u201Cand have come to live at Nanterre with my fowls and rabbits. I was\r\nvery fond of him, you see, for I could tell that he was a good-hearted\r\nfellow. Ah, we might have been so happy together! It\u2019s a sad pity.\r\nWell, we must bear it as best we can, Monsieur Claude. Come and see me\r\none of these days. I\u2019ll have an omelet ready for you.\u201D\r\n\r\nHer eyes were dim with tears; but all at once she sprang up like a\r\nbrave woman who bears her sorrows with fortitude.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D she exclaimed, \u201Chere\u2019s old Mother Chantemesse coming to buy some\r\nturnips of me. The fat old lady\u2019s as sprightly as ever!\u201D\r\n\r\nClaude went off, and strolled about the footways. The dawn had risen in\r\nthe white sheaf of light at the end of the Rue Rambuteau; and the sun,\r\nnow level with the house-tops, was diffusing rosy rays which already\r\nfell in warm patches on the pavements. Claude was conscious of a gay\r\nawakening in the huge resonant markets\u2014indeed, all over the\r\nneighbourhood\u2014crowded with piles of food. It was like the joy that\r\ncomes after cure, the mirth of folks who are at last relieved of a\r\nheavy weight which has been pulling them down. He saw La Sarriette\r\ndisplaying a gold chain and singing amidst her plums and strawberries,\r\nwhile she playfully pulled the moustaches of Monsieur Jules, who was\r\narrayed in a velvet jacket. He also caught sight of Madame Lec\u0153ur and\r\nMademoiselle Saget passing along one of the covered ways, and looking\r\nless sallow than usual\u2014indeed, almost rosy\u2014as they laughed like bosom\r\nfriends over some amusing story. In the fish market, old Madame\r\nMehudin, who had returned to her stall, was slapping her fish, abusing\r\ncustomers, and snubbing the new inspector, a presumptuous young man\r\nwhom she had sworn to spank; while Claire, seemingly more languid and\r\nindolent than ever, extended her hands, blue from immersion in the\r\nwater of her tanks, to gather together a great heap of edible snails,\r\nshimmering with silvery slime. In the tripe market Auguste and\r\nAugustine, with the foolish expression of newly-married people, had\r\njust been purchasing some pigs\u2019 trotters, and were starting off in a\r\ntrap for their pork shop at Montrouge. Then, as it was now eight\r\no\u2019clock and already quite warm, Claude, on again coming to the Rue\r\nRambuteau, perceived Muche and Pauline playing at horses. Muche was\r\ncrawling along on all-fours, while Pauline sat on his back, and clung\r\nto his hair to keep herself from falling. However, a moving shadow\r\nwhich fell from the eaves of the market roof made Claude look up; and\r\nhe then espied Cadine and Marjolin aloft, kissing and warming\r\nthemselves in the sunshine, parading their loves before the whole\r\nneighbourhood like a pair of light-hearted animals.\r\n\r\nClaude shook his fist at them. All this joyousness down below and on\r\nhigh exasperated him. He reviled the Fat; the Fat, he declared, had\r\nconquered the Thin. All around him he could see none but the Fat\r\nprotruding their paunches, bursting with robust health, and greeting\r\nwith delight another day of gorging and digestion. And a last blow was\r\ndealt to him by the spectacle which he perceived on either hand as he\r\nhalted opposite the Rue Pirouette.\r\n\r\nOn his right, the beautiful Norman, or the beautiful Madame Lebigre, as\r\nshe was now called, stood at the door of her shop. Her husband had at\r\nlength been granted the privilege of adding a State tobacco agency[*]\r\nto his wine shop, a long-cherished dream of his which he had finally\r\nbeen able to realise through the great services he had rendered to the\r\nauthorities. And to Claude the beautiful Madame Lebigre looked superb,\r\nwith her silk dress and her frizzed hair, quite ready to take her seat\r\nbehind her counter, whither all the gentlemen in the neighbourhood\r\nflocked to buy their cigars and packets of tobacco. She had become\r\nquite distinguished, quite the lady. The shop behind her had been newly\r\npainted, with borders of twining vine-branches showing against a soft\r\nbackground; the zinc-plated wine-counter gleamed brightly, and in the\r\ntall mirror the flasks of liqueurs set brighter flashes of colour than\r\never. And the mistress of all these things stood smiling radiantly at\r\nthe bright sunshine.\r\n\r\n[*] Most readers will remember that the tobacco trade is a State\r\nmonopoly in France. The retail tobacconists are merely Government\r\nagents.\u2014Translator.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, on Claude\u2019s left, the beautiful Lisa blocked up the doorway of\r\nher shop as she stood on the threshold. Never before had her linen\r\nshone with such dazzling whiteness; never had her serene face and rosy\r\ncheeks appeared in a more lustrous setting of glossy locks. She\r\ndisplayed the deep calmness of repletion, a massive tranquillity\r\nunruffled even by a smile. She was a picture of absolute quietude, of\r\nperfect felicity, not only cloudless but lifeless, the simple felicity\r\nof basking in the warm atmosphere. Her tightly stretched bodice seemed\r\nto be still digesting the happiness of yesterday; while her dimpled\r\nhands, hidden in the folds of her apron, did not even trouble to grasp\r\nat the happiness of to-day, certain as they were that it would come of\r\nitself. And the shop-window at her side seemed to display the same\r\nfelicity. It had recovered from its former blight; the tongues lolled\r\nout, red and healthy; the hams had regained their old chubbiness of\r\nform; the festoons of sausages no longer wore that mournful air which\r\nhad so greatly distressed Quenu. Hearty laughter, accompanied by a\r\njubilant clattering of pans, sounded from the kitchen in the rear. The\r\nwhole place again reeked with fat health. The flitches of bacon and the\r\nsides of pork that hung against the marble showed roundly like\r\npaunches, triumphant paunches, whilst Lisa, with her imposing breadth\r\nof shoulders and dignity of mien, bade the markets good morning with\r\nthose big eyes of hers which so clearly bespoke a gross feeder.\r\n\r\nHowever, the two women bowed to each other. Beautiful Madame Lebigre\r\nand beautiful Madame Quenu exchanged a friendly salute.\r\n\r\nAnd then Claude, who had certainly forgotten to dine on the previous\r\nday, was thrilled with anger at seeing them standing there, looking so\r\nhealthy and well-to-do with their buxom bosoms; and tightening his\r\nsash, he growled in a tone of irritation:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat blackguards respectable people are!\u201D\r\n\r\n
