KNOTTED STRANDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE STABLE-YARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one of those exquisite days that come in every winter, in which\r\nit seems no longer the dead body, but the lovely ghost of summer. Such\r\na day bears to its sister of the happier time something of the relation\r\nthe marble statue bears to the living form; the sense it awakes of\r\nbeauty is more abstract, more ethereal; it lifts the soul into a higher\r\nregion than will summer day of lordliest splendour. It is like the love\r\nthat loss has purified.\r\n\r\nSuch, however, were not the thoughts that at the moment occupied the\r\nmind of Malcolm Colonsay. Indeed, the loveliness of the morning was\r\nbut partially visible from the spot where he stood--the stable-yard of\r\nLossie House, ancient and roughly paved. It was a hundred years since\r\nthe stones had been last relaid and levelled: none of the horses of\r\nthe late Marquis minded it but one--her whom the young man in Highland\r\ndress was now grooming--and she would have fidgeted had it been an oak\r\nfloor. The yard was a long and wide space, with two-storied buildings\r\non all sides of it. In the centre of one of them rose the clock, and\r\nthe morning sun shone red on its tarnished gold. It was an ancient\r\nclock, but still capable of keeping good time--good enough, at least,\r\nfor all the requirements of the house, even when the family was at\r\nhome, seeing it never stopped, and the church clock was always ordered\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nIt not only set the time, but seemed also to set the fashion of the\r\nplace, for the whole aspect of it was one of wholesome, weather-beaten,\r\ntime-worn existence. One of the good things that accompany good blood\r\nis that its possessor does not much mind a shabby coat. Tarnish and\r\nlichens and water-wearing, a wavy house-ridge, and a few families of\r\nworms in the wainscot do not annoy the marquis as they do the city man\r\nwho has just bought a little place in the country. When an old family\r\nceases to go lovingly with nature, I see no reason why it should go\r\nany longer. An old tree is venerable, and an old picture precious to\r\nthe soul, but an old house, on which has been laid none but loving and\r\nrespectful hands, is dear to the very heart. Even an old barn door,\r\nwith the carved initials of hinds and maidens of vanished centuries,\r\nhas a place of honour in the cabinet of the poet\u2019s brain. It was\r\ncenturies since Lossie House had begun to grow shabby--and beautiful;\r\nand he to whom it now belonged was not one to discard the reverend for\r\nthe neat, or let the vanity of possession interfere with the grandeur\r\nof inheritance.\r\n\r\nBeneath the tarnished gold of the clock, flushed with the red winter\r\nsun, he was at this moment grooming the coat of a powerful black mare.\r\nThat he had not been brought up a groom was pretty evident from the\r\nfact that he was not hissing; but that he was Marquis of Lossie there\r\nwas nothing about him to show. The mare looked dangerous. Every now\r\nand then she cast back a white glance of the one visible eye. But the\r\nyouth was on his guard, and as wary as fearless in his handling of her.\r\nWhen at length he had finished the toilet which her restlessness--for\r\nher four feet were never all still at once upon the stones--had\r\nconsiderably protracted, he took from his pocket a lump of sugar, and\r\nheld it for her to bite at with her angry-looking teeth.\r\n\r\nIt was a keen frost, but in the sun the icicles had begun to drop. The\r\nroofs in the shadow were covered with hoar frost; wherever there was\r\nshadow there was whiteness. But for all the cold, there was keen life\r\nin the air, and yet keener life in the two animals, biped and quadruped.\r\n\r\nAs they thus stood, the one trying to sweeten the other\u2019s relation to\r\nhimself, if he could not hope much for her general temper, a man, who\r\nlooked half farmer, half lawyer, appeared on the opposite side of the\r\ncourt in the shadow.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are spoiling that mare, MacPhail,\u201D he cried.\r\n\r\n\u201CI canna weel du that, sir; she canna be muckle waur,\u201D said the youth.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s whip and spur she wants, not sugar.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe has had, and sall hae baith, time aboot (_in turn_); and I houp\r\nthey\u2019ll du something for her in time, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHer time shall be short here, anyhow. She\u2019s not worth the sugar you\r\ngive her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEh, sir! luik at her,\u201D said Malcolm, in a tone of expostulation, as he\r\nstepped back a few paces and regarded her with admiring eyes. \u201CSaw ye\r\never sic legs? an\u2019 sic a neck? an\u2019 sic a heid? an\u2019 sic fore an\u2019 hin\u2019\r\nquarters? She\u2019s a\u2019 bonny but the temper o\u2019 her, an\u2019 that she canna help\r\nlike the likes o\u2019 you an\u2019 me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019ll be the death o\u2019 somebody some day. The sooner we get rid of her\r\nthe better. Just look at that,\u201D he added, as the mare laid back her\r\nears and made a vicious snap at nothing in particular.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe was a favourite o\u2019 my--maister, the marquis,\u201D returned the youth,\r\n\u201Can\u2019 I wad ill like to pairt wi\u2019 her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll take any offer in reason for her,\u201D said the factor. \u201CYou\u2019ll just\r\nride her to Forres market next week, and see what you can get for her.\r\nI do think she\u2019s quieter since you took her in hand.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure she is--but it winna laist a day. The moment I lea\u2019 her,\r\nshe\u2019ll be as ill \u2019s ever,\u201D said the youth. \u201CShe has a kin\u2019 o\u2019 a likin\u2019\r\nto me, \u2019cause I gi\u2019e her sugar, an\u2019 she canna cast me; but she\u2019s no\r\na bit better i\u2019 the hert o\u2019 her yet. She\u2019s an oonsanctifeed brute. I\r\ncudna think o\u2019 sellin\u2019 her like this.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLat them \u2019at buys tak tent (_beware_),\u201D said the factor.\r\n\r\n\u201COw ay! lat them; I dinna objec\u2019; gien only they ken what she\u2019s like\r\nafore they buy her,\u201D rejoined Malcolm.\r\n\r\nThe factor burst out laughing. To his judgment the youth had spoken\r\nlike an idiot.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll not send you to sell,\u201D he said. \u201CStoat shall go with you, and\r\nyou shall have nothing to do but hold the mare and your own tongue.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSir,\u201D said Malcolm, seriously, \u201Cye dinna mean what ye say? Ye said\r\nyersel\u2019 she wad be the deith o\u2019 somebody, an\u2019 to sell her ohn tell\u2019t\r\nwhat she\u2019s like wad be to caw the saxt comman\u2019ment clean to shivers.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat may be good doctrine i\u2019 the kirk, my lad, but it\u2019s pure heresy\r\ni\u2019 the horse-market. No, no! You buy a horse as you take a wife-- for\r\nbetter for worse, as the case may be. A woman\u2019s not bound to tell her\r\nfaults when a man wants to marry her. If she keeps off the worst of\r\nthem afterwards, it\u2019s all he has a right to look for.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHoot, sir! there\u2019s no a pair o\u2019 parallel lines in a\u2019 the compairison,\u201D\r\nreturned Malcolm. \u201CMistress Kelpie here\u2019s e\u2019en ower ready to confess\r\nher fauts, an\u2019 that by giein\u2019 a taste o\u2019 them; she winna bide to be\r\nspeired; but for haudin\u2019 aff o\u2019 them efter the bargain\u2019s made--ye ken\r\nshe\u2019s no even responsible for the bargain. An\u2019 gien ye expec\u2019 me to\r\nhaud my tongue aboot them--faith, Maister Crathie, I wad as sune think\r\no\u2019 sellin\u2019 a rotten boat to Blue Peter. Gien the man \u2019at has her to see\r\ntill, dinna ken to luik oot for a storm o\u2019 iron shune or lang teeth ony\r\nmoment, his wife may be a widow that same market nicht. An\u2019 forbye,\r\nit\u2019s again\u2019 the aucht comman\u2019ment as weel \u2019s the saxt. There\u2019s nae\r\nexception there in regaird o\u2019 horse flesh. We maun be honest i\u2019 that\r\nas weel \u2019s i\u2019 corn or herrin\u2019, or onything ither \u2019at\u2019s coft an\u2019 sell\u2019t\r\natween man an\u2019 his neibor.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s one commandment, my lad,\u201D said Mr Crathie, with the dignity of\r\nintended rebuke, \u201Cyou seem to find hard to learn, and that is, to mind\r\nyour own business.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGien ye mean catchin\u2019 the herrin\u2019, maybe ye\u2019re richt,\u201D said the youth.\r\n\u201CI ken muir aboot that nor the horse-coupin\u2019, an\u2019 it\u2019s full cleaner.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNone of your impudence!\u201D returned the factor. \u201CThe marquis is not here\r\nto uphold you in your follies. That they amused him is no reason why\r\nI should put up with them. So keep your tongue between your teeth, or\r\nyou\u2019ll find it the worse for you.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe youth smiled a little oddly, and held his peace.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re here to do what I tell you, and make no remarks,\u201D added the\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m awaur o\u2019 that, sir--within certain leemits,\u201D returned Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you mean by that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI mean within the leemits o\u2019 duin\u2019 by yer neibor as ye wad ha\u2019e yer\r\nneibor du by you--that\u2019s what I mean, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve told you already that doesn\u2019t apply in horse-dealing. Every man\r\nhas to take care of himself in the horse-market: that\u2019s understood. If\r\nyou had been brought up amongst horses instead of herring, you would\r\nhave known that as well as any other man.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI doobt I\u2019ll ha\u2019e to gang back to the herrin\u2019 than, sir, for they\u2019re\r\nlike to pruv\u2019 the honester o\u2019 the twa. But there\u2019s nae hypocrisy in\r\nKelpie, an\u2019 she maun ha\u2019e her day\u2019s denner, come o\u2019 the morn\u2019s what\r\nmay.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt the word _hypocrisy_, Mr Crathie\u2019s face grew red as the sun in a\r\nfog. He was an elder of the kirk, and had family worship every night as\r\nregularly as his toddy. So the word was as offensive and insolent as it\r\nwas foolish and inapplicable. He would have turned Malcolm adrift on\r\nthe spot, but that he remembered--not the favour of the late marquis\r\nfor the lad--that was nothing to the factor now: his lord under the\r\nmould was to him as if he had never been above it--but the favour\r\nof the present marchioness, for all in the house knew that she was\r\ninterested in him. Choking down therefore his rage and indignation, he\r\nsaid sternly:\r\n\r\n\u201CMalcolm, you have two enemies--a long tongue, and a strong conceit.\r\nYou have little enough to be proud of, my man, and the less said the\r\nbetter. I advise you to mind what you\u2019re about, and show suitable\r\nrespect to your superiors, or as sure as judgment, you\u2019ll go back to\r\nfish-guts.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, Malcolm had been smoothing Kelpie all over with his\r\npalms; the moment the factor ceased talking, he ceased stroking, and\r\nwith one arm thrown over the mare\u2019s back, looked him full in the face.\r\n\r\n\u201CGien ye imaigine, Maister Crathie,\u201D he said, \u201C\u2019at I coont it ony rise\r\ni\u2019 the warl\u2019 \u2019at brings me un\u2019er the orders o\u2019 a man less honest than\r\nhe micht be, ye\u2019re mista\u2019en. I dinna think it\u2019s pride this time; I wad\r\nile Blue Peter\u2019s lang butes till him, but I winna lee for ony factor\r\natween this an\u2019 Davy Jones.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was too much. Mr Crathie\u2019s feelings overcame him, and he was a\r\nwrathful man to see, as he strode up to the youth with clenched fist.\r\n\r\n\u201CHaud frae the mere, for God\u2019s sake, Maister Crathie,\u201D cried Malcolm.\r\n\r\nBut even as he spoke, two reversed Moorish arches of gleaming iron\r\nopened on the terror-quickened imagination of the factor a threatened\r\ndescent from which his most potent instinct, that of self-preservation,\r\nshrank in horror. He started back white with dismay, having by a\r\nbare inch of space and a bare moment of time, escaped what he called\r\nEternity. Dazed with fear he turned and had staggered half-way across\r\nthe yard, as if going home, before he recovered himself. Then he turned\r\nagain, and with what dignity he could scrape together said--\r\n\r\n\u201CMacPhail, you go about your business.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn his foolish heart he believed Malcolm had made the brute strike out.\r\n\r\n\u201CI canna weel gang till Stoat comes hame,\u201D answered Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I see you about the place after sunset, I\u2019ll horsewhip you,\u201D said\r\nthe factor, and walked away, showing the crown of his hat.\r\n\r\nMalcolm again smiled oddly, but made no reply. He undid the mare\u2019s\r\nhalter, and took her into the stable. There he fed her, standing by\r\nher all the time she ate, and not once taking his eyes off her. His\r\nfather, the late marquis, had bought her at the sale of the stud of\r\na neighbouring laird, whose whole being had been devoted to horses,\r\ntill the pale one came to fetch himself: the men about the stable had\r\ndrugged her, and, taken with the splendid lines of the animal, nor\r\nseeing cause to doubt her temper as she quietly obeyed the halter,\r\nhe had bid for her, and, as he thought, had her a great bargain. The\r\naccident that finally caused his death followed immediately after,\r\nand while he was ill no one cared to vex him by saying what she had\r\nturned out. But Malcolm had even then taken her in hand in the hope\r\nof taming her a little before his master, who often spoke of his\r\nlatest purchase, should see her again. In this he had very partially\r\nsucceeded; but if only for the sake of him whom he now knew for his\r\nfather, nothing would have made him part with the animal. Besides, he\r\nhad been compelled to use her with so much severity at times that he\r\nhad grown attached to her from the reaction of pity as well as from\r\nadmiration of her physical qualities, and the habitude of ministering\r\nto her wants and comforts. The factor, who knew Malcolm only as a\r\nservant, had afterwards allowed her to remain in his charge, merely in\r\nthe hope, through his treatment, of by-and-by selling her, as she had\r\nbeen bought, for a faultless animal, but at a far better price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished her oats, Malcolm left her busy with her hay,\r\nfor she was a huge eater, and went into the house, passing through the\r\nkitchen and ascending a spiral stone stair to the library--the only\r\nroom not now dismantled. As he went along the narrow passage on the\r\nsecond floor leading to it from the head of the stair, the housekeeper,\r\nMrs Courthope, peeped after him from one of the many bedrooms opening\r\nupon it, and watched him as he went, nodding her head two or three\r\ntimes with decision: he reminded her so strongly --not of his father,\r\nthe last marquis, but the brother who had preceded him, that she felt\r\nall but certain, whoever might be his mother, he had as much of the\r\nColonsay blood in his veins as any marquis of them all. It was in\r\nconsideration of this likeness that Mr Crathie had permitted the youth,\r\nwhen his services were not required, to read in the library.\r\n\r\nMalcolm went straight to a certain corner, and from amongst a dingy\r\nset of old classics took down a small Greek book, in large type. It\r\nwas the manual of that slave among slaves, that noble among the free,\r\nEpictetus. He was no great Greek scholar, but, with the help of the\r\nLatin translation, and the gloss of his own rathe experience, he could\r\nlay hold of the mind of that slave of a slave, whose very slavery was\r\nhis slave to carry him to the heights of freedom. It was not Greek he\r\ncared for, but Epictetus. It was but little he read, however, for the\r\noccurrence of the morning demanded, compelled thought. Mr Crathie\u2019s\r\nbehaviour caused him neither anger nor uneasiness, but it rendered\r\nnecessary some decision with regard to the ordering of his future.\r\n\r\nI can hardly say he recalled how, on his death-bed, the late marquis,\r\nabout three months before, having, with all needful observances,\r\nacknowledged him his son, had committed to his trust the welfare of\r\nhis sister; for the memory of this charge was never absent from his\r\nfeeling even when not immediately present to his thought. But although\r\na charge which he would have taken upon him all the same had his father\r\nnot committed it to him, it was none the less a source of perplexity\r\nupon which as yet all his thinking had let in but little light. For to\r\nappear as Marquis of Lossie was not merely to take from his sister the\r\ntitle she supposed her own, but to declare her illegitimate, seeing\r\nthat, unknown to the marquis, the youth\u2019s mother, his first wife, was\r\nstill alive when Florimel was born. How to act so that as little evil\r\nas possible might befall the favourite of his father, and one whom he\r\nhad himself loved with the devotion almost of a dog, before he knew she\r\nwas his sister, was the main problem.\r\n\r\nFor himself, he had had a rough education, and had enjoyed it: his\r\nthoughts were not troubled about his own prospects. Mysteriously\r\ncommitted to the care of a poor blind Highland piper, a stranger from\r\ninland regions, settled amongst a fishing people, he had, as he grew\r\nup, naturally fallen into their ways of life and labour, and but\r\nlately abandoned the calling of a fisherman to take charge of the\r\nmarquis\u2019s yacht, whence, by degrees, he had, in his helpfulness, grown\r\nindispensable to him and his daughter, and had come to live in the\r\nhouse of Lossie as a privileged servant. His book education, which he\r\nowed mainly to the friendship of the parish schoolmaster, although\r\nnothing marvellous, or in Scotland very peculiar, had opened for him\r\nin all directions doors of thought and inquiry, but the desire of\r\nknowledge was in his case, again through the influences of Mr Graham,\r\nsubservient to an almost restless yearning after the truth of things, a\r\npassion so rare that the ordinary mind can hardly master even the fact\r\nof its existence.\r\n\r\nThe Marchioness of Lossie, as she was now called, for the family\r\nwas one of the two or three in Scotland in which the title descends\r\nto an heiress, had left Lossie House almost immediately upon her\r\nfather\u2019s death, under the guardianship of a certain dowager countess.\r\nLady Bellair had taken her first to Edinburgh, and then to London.\r\nTidings of her Malcolm occasionally received through Mr Soutar of Duff\r\nHarbour, the lawyer the marquis had employed to draw up the papers\r\nsubstantiating the youth\u2019s claim. The last amounted to this, that, as\r\nrapidly as the proprieties of mourning would permit, she was circling\r\nthe vortex of the London season; and Malcolm was now almost in despair\r\nof ever being of the least service to her as a brother to whom as a\r\nservant he had seemed at one time of daily necessity. If he might but\r\nonce be her skipper, her groom, her attendant, he might then at least\r\nlearn how to discover to her the bond between them, without breaking it\r\nin the very act, and so ruining the hope of service to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMISS HORN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and in walked a tall, gaunt, hard-featured woman, in\r\na huge bonnet, trimmed with black ribbons, and a long black net veil,\r\nworked over with sprigs, coming down almost to her waist. She looked\r\nstern, determined, almost fierce, shook hands with a sort of loose\r\ndissatisfaction, and dropped into one of the easy chairs in which the\r\nlibrary abounded. With the act the question seemed shot from her--\r\n\r\n\u201CDuv ye ca\u2019 yersel\u2019 an honest man, noo, Ma\u2019colm?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI ca\u2019 mysel\u2019 naething,\u201D answered the youth; \u201Cbut I wad fain be what ye\r\nsay, Miss Horn.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COw! I dinna doobt ye wadna steal, nor yet tell lees aboot a horse:\r\nI ha\u2019e jist come frae a sair waggin\u2019 o\u2019 tongues aboot ye.

But lee it wad\r\nbe, an\u2019 dinna ye aither wag or haud a leein\u2019 tongue. A gentleman maunna\r\nlee, no even by sayin\u2019 naething--na, no gien \u2019t war to win intill the\r\nkingdom. But, Guid be thankit, that\u2019s whaur leears never come. Maybe\r\nye\u2019re thinkin\u2019 I ha\u2019e sma\u2019 occasion to say sic like to yersel\u2019.

I daursay she\u2019s no jist a sa\u2019nt yet, but that\u2019s\r\nno to be luiked for in ane o\u2019 the breed: they maun a\u2019 try the warl\u2019\r\nfirst ony gait. There\u2019s a heap o\u2019 fowk--an\u2019 no aye the warst, maybe,\u201D\r\ncontinued Malcolm, thinking of his father, \u201C\u2019at wull ha\u2019e their bite o\u2019\r\nthe aipple afore they spite it oot. But for my leddy sister, she\u2019s owre\r\nprood ever to disgrace hersel\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, maybe, gien she bena misguidit by them she\u2019s wi\u2019.

An\u2019 dinna\r\nthink, mem, I\u2019m gaein to forget the deid, \u2019cause I\u2019m mair concernt\r\naboot the leevin\u2019. I tell ye I jist dinna ken what to du.

An\u2019 here I am, her ane\r\nhalf-brither, wi\u2019 naething i\u2019 my pooer but to scaud the hert o\u2019 her,\r\nor else lee!

It\u2019s no as gien I had had han\u2019 or tongue in ony foregane\r\nlee. It was naething o\u2019 my duin\u2019, as ye ken, mem. To mysel\u2019, I was\r\nnever onything but a fisherman born. I confess \u2019at whiles, when we wad\r\nbe lyin\u2019 i\u2019 the lee o\u2019 the nets, tethered to them like, wi\u2019 the win\u2019\r\nblawin\u2019 strong an\u2019 steady, I ha\u2019e thocht wi\u2019 mysel\u2019 \u2019at I kent naething\r\naboot my father, an\u2019 what gien it sud turn oot \u2019at I was the son o\u2019\r\nsomebody--what wad I du wi\u2019 my siller?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAn\u2019 what thoucht ye ye wad du, laddie?\u201D asked Miss Horn gently.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat but bigg a harbour at Scaurnose for the puir fisher-fowk \u2019at was\r\nlike my ain flesh and blude!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel,\u201D rejoined Miss Horn eagerly, \u201Cdiv ye no look upo\u2019 that as a voo\r\nto the Almichty--a voo \u2019at ye\u2019re bun\u2019 to pay, noo \u2019at ye ha\u2019e yer wuss?\r\nAn\u2019 it\u2019s no merely \u2019at _ye_ ha\u2019e the means, but there\u2019s no anither that\r\nhas the richt; for they\u2019re yer ain fowk, \u2019at ye gaither rent frae, an\r\n\u2019at\u2019s been for mony a generation sattlet upo\u2019 yer lan\u2019--though for\r\nthe maitter o\u2019 the lan\u2019, they ha\u2019e had little mair o\u2019 that than the\r\nbirds o\u2019 the rock ha\u2019e ohn feued--an\u2019 them honest fowks wi\u2019 wives an\u2019\r\nsowls o\u2019 their ain!

This is hoo the\r\npiece begins:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Who is the happy warrior?

She arose herself also, and looked after him from the\r\ndoor--a proud and peevish woman, jealous of her husband\u2019s dignity,\r\nstill more jealous of her own.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe verra image o\u2019 the auld markis!\u201D she said to herself; for in the\r\nrecesses of her bosom she spoke the Scotch she scorned to utter aloud;\r\n\u201Cand sits jist like himsel\u2019, wi\u2019 a wee stoop i\u2019 the saiddle, and ilka\r\nnoo an\u2019 than a swing o\u2019 his haill boady back, as gien some thoucht had\r\nset him straught.--Gien the fractious brute wad but brak a bane or twa\r\no\u2019 him!\u201D she went on in growing anger. \u201CThe impidence o\u2019 the fallow! He\r\nhas his leave: what for disna he tak it an\u2019 gang? But oot o\u2019 this, gang\r\nhe sall. To ca\u2019 a man like mine a heepocreet \u2019cause he wadna procleem\r\ntill a haill market ilka secret fau\u2019t o\u2019 the horse he had to sell!\r\nHaith, he cam upo\u2019 the wrang side o\u2019 the sheet to play the lord and\r\nmaister here! and that I can tell him!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe mare was fresh, and the roads through the policy hard both by\r\nnature and by frost, so that he could not let her go, and had enough\r\nto do with her. He turned, therefore, towards the sea-gate, and soon\r\nreached the shore. There, westward of the Seaton, where the fisher-folk\r\nlived, the sand lay smooth, flat, and wet along the edge of the\r\nreceding tide: he gave Kelpie the rein, and she sprang into a wild\r\ngallop, every now and then flinging her heels as high as her rider\u2019s\r\nhead. But finding, as they approached the stony part from which rose\r\nthe great rock called the Bored Craig, that he could not pull her up\r\nin time, he turned her head towards the long dune of sand which, a\r\nlittle beyond the tide, ran parallel with the shore. It was dry and\r\nloose, and the ascent steep. Kelpie\u2019s hoofs sank at every step, and\r\nwhen she reached the top, with wide-spread struggling haunches, and\r\n\u201Cnostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,\u201D he had her in hand. She\r\nstood panting, yet pawing and dancing, and making the sand fly in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a woman with a child in her arms rose, as it seemed to\r\nMalcolm, under Kelpie\u2019s very head. She wheeled and reared, and, in\r\nwrath or in terror, strained every nerve to unseat her rider, while,\r\nwhether from faith or despair, the woman stood still as a statue,\r\nstaring at the struggle.\r\n\r\n\u201CHaud awa\u2019 a bit, Lizzy,\u201D cried Malcolm. \u201CShe\u2019s a mad brute, an\u2019 I\r\nmayna be able to haud her. Ye ha\u2019e the bairnie, ye see!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was a young woman, with a sad white face. To what Malcolm said she\r\npaid no heed, but stood with her child in her arms and gazed at Kelpie\r\nas she went on plunging and kicking about on the top of the dune.\r\n\r\n\u201CI reckon ye wadna care though the she-deevil knockit oot yer harns;\r\nbut ye ha\u2019e the bairn, woman! Ha\u2019e mercy on the bairn, an\u2019 rin to the\r\nboddom.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI want to speak to ye, Ma\u2019colm MacPhail,\u201D she said, in a tone whose\r\nvery stillness revealed a depth of trouble.\r\n\r\n\u201CI doobt I canna hearken to ye richt the noo,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CBut bide\r\na wee.\u201D He swung himself from Kelpie\u2019s back, and, hanging hard on the\r\nbit with one hand, searched with the other in the pocket of his coat,\r\nsaying, as he did so--\r\n\r\n\u201CSugar, Kelpie! sugar!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe animal gave an eager snort, settled on her feet, and began\r\nsnuffing about him. He made haste, for, if her eagerness should turn\r\nto impatience, she would do her endeavour to bite him. After crunching\r\nthree or four lumps, she stood pretty quiet, and Malcolm must make the\r\nbest of what time she would give him.\r\n\r\n\u201CNoo, Lizzy!\u201D he said hurriedly. \u201CSpeyk while ye can.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMa\u2019colm,\u201D said the girl, and looked him full in the face for a moment,\r\nfor agony had overcome shame; then her gaze sought the far horizon,\r\nwhich to seafaring people is as the hills whence cometh their aid to\r\nthe people who dwell among mountains; \u201C--Ma\u2019colm, he\u2019s gaein\u2019 to merry\r\nLeddy Florimel.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm started. Could the girl have learned more concerning his sister\r\nthan had yet reached himself? A fine watching over her was his, truly!\r\nBut who was this _he_?\r\n\r\nLizzy had never uttered the name of the father of her child, and all\r\nher people knew was that he could not be a fisherman, for then he would\r\nhave married her before the child was born. But Malcolm had had a\r\nsuspicion from the first, and now her words all but confirmed it.--And\r\nwas that fellow going to marry his sister? He turned white with\r\ndismay--then red with anger, and stood speechless.\r\n\r\nBut he was quickly brought to himself by a sharp pinch under the\r\nshoulder blade from Kelpie\u2019s long teeth: he had forgotten her, and she\r\nhad taken the advantage.\r\n\r\n\u201CWha tellt ye that, Lizzy?\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m no at leeberty to say, Ma\u2019colm, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s true, an\u2019 my\r\nhert\u2019s like to brak.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPuir lassie!\u201D said Malcolm, whose own trouble had never at any time\r\nrendered him insensible to that of others. \u201CBut is \u2019t onybody \u2019at\r\n_kens_ what he says?\u201D he pursued.\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, I dinna jist richtly ken gien she _kens_, but I think she maun\r\nha\u2019e gude rizzon, or she wadna say as she says. Oh me! me! my bairnie\r\n\u2019ill be scornin\u2019 me sair whan he comes to ken. Ma\u2019colm, ye\u2019re the only\r\nane \u2019at disna luik doon upo\u2019 me, an whan ye cam ower the tap o\u2019 the\r\nBoar\u2019s Tail, it was like an angel in a fire-flaucht, an\u2019 something\r\ninside me said--_Tell \u2019im; tell \u2019im;_ an\u2019 sae I bude to tell ye.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm was even too simple to feel flattered by the girl\u2019s confidence,\r\nthough to be trusted is a greater _compliment_ than to be loved.\r\n\r\n\u201CHearken, Lizzy!\u201D he said. \u201CI canna e\u2019en think, wi\u2019 this brute ready\r\nilka meenute to ate me up. I maun tak her hame. Efter that, gien ye\r\nwad like to tell me onything, I s\u2019 be at yer service. Bide aboot\r\nhere--or, luik ye: here\u2019s the key o\u2019 yon door; come throu\u2019 that intill\r\nthe park--throu\u2019 aneth the toll ro\u2019d, ye ken. There ye\u2019ll get into the\r\nlythe (_lee_) wi\u2019 the bairnie; an\u2019 I\u2019ll be wi\u2019 ye in a quarter o\u2019 an\r\nhoor. It\u2019ll tak me but twa meenutes to gang hame. Stoat \u2019ill put up the\r\nmere, and I\u2019ll be back--I can du \u2019t in ten meenutes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEh! dinna hurry for me, Ma\u2019colm: I\u2019m no worth it,\u201D said Lizzy.\r\n\r\nBut Malcolm was already at full speed along the top of the dune.\r\n\r\n\u201CLord preserve \u2019s!\u201D cried Lizzy, when she saw him clear the brass\r\nswivel. \u201CSic a laad as that is! Eh, he maun ha\u2019e a richt lass to lo\u2019e\r\nhim some day! It\u2019s a\u2019 ane to him, boat or beast. He wadna turn frae the\r\ndeil himsel\u2019. An syne he\u2019s jist as saft \u2019s a deuk\u2019s neck whan he speyks\r\ntill a wuman or a bairn--ay, or an auld man aither!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd full of trouble as it was about another, Lizzy\u2019s heart yet ached at\r\nthe thought that she should be so unworthy of one like him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nLIZZY FINDLAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the sands she saw him gain the turnpike road with a bound and a\r\nscramble. Crossing it he entered the park by the sea-gate; she had to\r\nenter it by the tunnel that passed under the same road. She approached\r\nthe grated door, unlocked it, and looked in with a shudder. It was\r\ndark, the other end of it being obscured by trees, and the roots of the\r\nhill on whose top stood the temple of the winds. Through the tunnel\r\nblew what seemed quite another wind --one of death, from regions\r\nbeneath. She drew her shawl, one end of which was rolled about her\r\nbaby, closer around them both ere she entered. Never before had she\r\nset foot within the place, and a strange horror of it filled her: she\r\ndid not know that by that passage, on a certain lovely summer night,\r\nLord Meikleham had issued to meet her on the sands under the moon. The\r\nsea was not terrible to her; she knew all its ways nearly as well as\r\nMalcolm knew the moods of Kelpie; but the earth and its ways were less\r\nknown to her, and to turn her face towards it and enter by a little\r\ndoor into its bosom was like a visit to her grave. But she gathered\r\nher strength, entered with a shudder, passed in growing hope and\r\nfinal safety through it, and at the other end came out again into the\r\nlight, only the cold of its death seemed to cling to her still. But\r\nthe day had grown colder; the clouds that, seen or unseen, ever haunt\r\nthe winter sun, had at length caught and shrouded him, and through\r\nthe gathering vapours he looked ghastly. The wind blew from the sea.\r\nThe tide was going down. There was snow in the air. The thin leafless\r\ntrees were all bending away from the shore, and the wind went sighing,\r\nhissing, and almost wailing through their bare boughs and budless\r\ntwigs. There would be a storm, she thought, ere the morning, but none\r\nof their people were out.\r\n\r\nHad there been--well, she had almost ceased to care about anything, and\r\nher own life was so little to her now, that she had become less able to\r\nvalue that of other people. To this had the _ignis fatuus_ of a false\r\nlove brought her! She had dreamed heedlessly, to awake sorrowfully.\r\nBut not until she heard he was going to be married, had she come right\r\nawake, and now she could dream no more. Alas! alas! what claim had she\r\nupon him? How could she tell, since such he was, what poor girl like\r\nherself she might not have robbed of her part in him?\r\n\r\nYet even in the midst of her misery and despair, it was some\r\nconsolation to think that Malcolm was her friend.\r\n\r\nNot knowing that he had already suffered from the blame of her fault,\r\nor the risk at which he met her, she would have gone towards the house\r\nto meet him the sooner, had not this been a part of the grounds where\r\nshe knew Mr Crathie tolerated no one without express leave given. The\r\nfisher-folk in particular must keep to the road by the other side of\r\nthe burn, to which the sea-gate admitted them. Lizzy therefore lingered\r\nnear the tunnel, afraid of being seen.\r\n\r\nMr Crathie was a man who did well under authority, but upon the top\r\nof it was consequential, overbearing, and far more exacting than the\r\nmarquis. Full of his employer\u2019s importance when he was present, and\r\nof his own when he was absent, he was yet in the latter circumstances\r\nso doubtful of its adequate recognition by those under him, that he\r\nhad grown very imperious, and resented with indignation the slightest\r\nbreach of his orders. Hence he was in no great favour with the fishers.\r\n\r\nNow all the day he had been fuming over Malcolm\u2019s behaviour to him in\r\nthe morning, and when he went home and learned that his wife had seen\r\nhim upon Kelpie, as if nothing had happened, he became furious, and, in\r\nthis possession of the devil, was at the present moment wandering about\r\nthe grounds, brooding on the words Malcolm had spoken. He could not get\r\nrid of them. They caused an acrid burning in his bosom, for they had in\r\nthem truth, like which no poison stings.\r\n\r\nMalcolm, having crossed by the great bridge at the house, hurried down\r\nthe western side of the burn to find Lizzy, and soon came upon her,\r\nwalking up and down.\r\n\r\n\u201CEh, lassie, ye maun be cauld!\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo that cauld,\u201D she answered, and with the words burst into tears:\r\n\u201CBut naebody says a kin\u2019 word to me noo,\u201D she said in excuse, \u201Can\u2019 I\r\ncanna weel bide the soun\u2019 o\u2019 ane when it comes; I\u2019m no used till \u2019t.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNaebody?\u201D exclaimed Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CNa, naebody,\u201D she answered. \u201CMy mither winna, my father daurna, an\u2019\r\nthe bairnie canna, an I gang near naebody forbye.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, we maunna stan\u2019 oot here i\u2019 the cauld: come this gait,\u201D said\r\nMalcolm. \u201CThe bairnie\u2019ll get its deid.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere wadna be mony to greit at that,\u201D returned Lizzy, and pressed the\r\nchild closer to her bosom.\r\n\r\nMalcolm led the way to the little chamber contrived under the temple\r\nin the heart of the hill, and unlocking the door made her enter. There\r\nhe seated her in a comfortable chair, and wrapped her in the plaid he\r\nhad brought for the purpose. It was all he could do to keep from taking\r\nher in his arms for very pity, for, both body and soul, she seemed too\r\nfrozen to shiver. He shut the door, sat down on the table near her, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s naebody to disturb \u2019s here, Lizzy: what wad ye say to me noo?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe sun was nearly down, and its light already almost smothered in\r\nclouds, so that the little chamber, whose door and window were in the\r\ndeep shadow of the hill, was nearly dark.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wadna hae ye tell me onything ye promised no to tell,\u201D resumed\r\nMalcolm, finding she did not reply, \u201Cbut I wad like to hear as muckle\r\nas ye can say.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI hae naething to tell ye, Ma\u2019colm, but jist \u2019at my leddy Florimel\u2019s\r\ngauin\u2019 to be merried upo\u2019 Lord Meikleham--Lord Liftore, they ca\u2019 him\r\nnoo. Hech me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGod forbid she sud be merried upon ony sic a bla\u2019guard!\u201D cried Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CDinna ca\u2019 \u2019im ill names, Ma\u2019colm. I canna bide it, though I hae no\r\nricht to tak up the stick for him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wadna say a word \u2019at micht fa\u2019 sair on a sair hert,\u201D he returned;\r\n\u201Cbut gien ye kent a\u2019, ye wad ken I hed a gey-sized craw to pluck wi\u2019 \u2019s\r\nlordship mysel\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe girl gave a low cry.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe wadna hurt \u2019im, Ma\u2019colm?\u201D she said, in terror at the thought of the\r\nelegant youth in the clutches of an angry fisherman, even if he were\r\nthe generous Malcolm MacPhail himself.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wad raither not,\u201D he replied, \u201Cbut we maun see hoo he cairries\r\nhimsel\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDu naething till \u2019im for my sake, Ma\u2019colm. Ye can hae naething again\u2019\r\nhim yersel\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was too dark for Malcolm to see the keen look of wistful regret with\r\nwhich Lizzy tried to pierce the gloom and read his face: for a moment\r\nthe poor girl thought he meant he had loved her himself. But far other\r\nthoughts were in Malcolm\u2019s mind: one was, that her whom, as a scarce\r\napproachable goddess, he had loved before he knew her of his own blood,\r\nhe would rather see married to an honest fisherman in the Seaton of\r\nPortlossie, than to such a lord as Meikleham. He had seen enough of\r\nhim at Lossie House to know what he was, and puritanical fish-catching\r\nMalcolm had ideas above those of most marquises of his day: the thought\r\nof the alliance was horrible to him. It was possibly not inevitable,\r\nhowever; only what could he do, and at the same time avoid grievous\r\nhurt?\r\n\r\n\u201CI dinna think he\u2019ll ever merry my leddy,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat gars ye say that, Ma\u2019colm?\u201D returned Lizzy, with eagerness.\r\n\r\n\u201CI canna tell ye jist i\u2019 the noo; but ye ken a body canna weel be\r\naye aboot a place ohn seein\u2019 things. I\u2019ll tell ye something o\u2019 mair\r\nconsequence hooever,\u201D he continued. \u201CSome fowk say there\u2019s a God, an\u2019\r\nsome say there\u2019s nane, an\u2019 I ha\u2019e no richt to preach to ye, Lizzy; but\r\nI maun jist tell ye this--\u2019at gien God dinna help them \u2019at cry till \u2019im\r\ni\u2019 the warst o\u2019 tribles, they micht jist as weel ha\u2019e nae God at a\u2019.\r\nFor my ain pairt I ha\u2019e been helpit, an\u2019 I think it was him intill \u2019t.\r\nWi\u2019 his help, a man may warstle throu\u2019 onything. I say I think it was\r\nhimsel\u2019 tuik me throu\u2019 \u2019t, an\u2019 here I stan\u2019 afore ye, ready for the\r\nneist trible, an\u2019 the help \u2019at \u2019ll come wi\u2019 \u2019t. What it may be, God\r\nonly kens!\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMR CRATHIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by the sudden opening of the door, and the voice of\r\nthe factor in exultant wrath.\r\n\r\n\u201CMacPhail!\u201D it cried. \u201CCome out with you. Don\u2019t think to sneak there.\r\n_I_ know you. What right have you to be on the premises? Didn\u2019t I send\r\nyou about your business this morning?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, sir, but ye didna pay me my wauges,\u201D said Malcolm, who had sprung\r\nto the door and now stood holding it half shut, while Mr Crathie pushed\r\nit half open.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo matter. You\u2019re nothing better than a housebreaker if you enter any\r\nbuilding about the place.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI brak nae lock,\u201D returned Malcolm. \u201CI ha\u2019e the key my lord gae me to\r\nilka place \u2019ithin the wa\u2019s excep\u2019 the strong room.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGive it me directly. _I\u2019m_ master here now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Deed, I s\u2019 du nae sic thing, sir. What he gae me I\u2019ll keep.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGive up that key, or I\u2019ll go at once and get a warrant against you for\r\ntheft.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, we s\u2019 refar \u2019t to Maister Soutar.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDamn your impudence--\u2019at I sud say \u2019t!--what has he to do with my\r\naffairs? Come out of that directly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHuly, huly, sir!\u201D returned Malcolm, in terror lest he should discover\r\nwho was with him.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou low-bred rascal! Who have you there with you?\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he spoke Mr Crathie would have forced his way into the dusky\r\nchamber, where he could just perceive a motionless undefined form. But\r\nstiff as a statue Malcolm kept his stand, and the door was immovable.\r\nMr Crathie gave a second and angrier push, but the youth\u2019s corporeal as\r\nwell as his mental equilibrium was hard to upset, and his enemy drew\r\nback in mounting fury.\r\n\r\n\u201CGet out of there,\u201D he cried, \u201Cor I\u2019ll horsewhip you for a damned\r\nblackguard.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhup awa\u2019,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cbut in here ye s\u2019 no come the nicht.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe factor rushed at him, his heavy whip upheaved--and the same moment\r\nfound himself, not in the room, but lying on the flower-bed in front of\r\nit. Malcolm instantly stepped out, locked the door, put the key in his\r\npocket, and turned to assist him. But he was up already, and busy with\r\nwords unbefitting the mouth of an elder of the kirk.\r\n\r\n\u201CDidna I say \u2019at ye sudna come in, sir? What for wull fowk no tak a\r\ntellin\u2019?\u201D expostulated Malcolm.\r\n\r\nBut the factor was far beyond force of logic or illumination of reason.\r\nHe raved and swore.\r\n\r\n\u201CGet oot o\u2019 my sicht,\u201D he cried, \u201Cor I\u2019ll shot ye like a tyke.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGang an\u2019 fess yer gun,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Can\u2019 gien ye fin\u2019 me waitin\u2019 for\r\nye, ye can lat at me.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe factor uttered a horrible imprecation on himself if he did not make\r\nhim pay dearly for his behaviour.\r\n\r\n\u201CHoots, sir! Be asham\u2019t o\u2019 yersel\u2019. Gang hame to the mistress, an\u2019 I s\u2019\r\nbe up the morn\u2019s mornin\u2019 for my wauges.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf ye set foot on the grounds again, I\u2019ll set every dog in the place\r\nupon you.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201CGien I was to turn the order the ither gait, wad they min\u2019 you or me,\r\ndiv ye think, Maister Crathie?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGive me that key, and go about your business.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNa, na, sir! What my lord gae me I s\u2019 keep--for a\u2019 the factors atween\r\nthis an\u2019 the Land\u2019s En\u2019,\u201D returned Malcolm. \u201CAn\u2019 for lea\u2019in\u2019 the place,\r\ngien I be na in your service, Maister Crathie, I\u2019m nae un\u2019er your\r\norders. I\u2019ll gang whan it suits me. An\u2019 mair yet, ye s\u2019 gang oot o\u2019\r\nthis first, or I s\u2019 gar ye, an that ye\u2019ll see.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was a violent proceeding, but for a matter of manners he was not\r\ngoing to risk what of her good name poor Lizzy had left: like the books\r\nof the Sibyl, that grew in value. He made, however, but one threatful\r\nstride towards the factor, for the great man turned and fled.\r\n\r\nThe moment he was out of sight, Malcolm unlocked the door, led Lizzy\r\nout, and brought her through the tunnel to the sands. There he left\r\nher, and set out for Scaurnose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nBLUE PETER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe door of Blue Peter\u2019s cottage was opened by his sister. Not much\r\nat home in the summer, when she carried fish to the country, she was\r\nvery little absent in the winter, and as there was but one room for\r\nall uses, except the closet bedroom and the garret at the top of the\r\nladder, Malcolm, instead of going in, called to his friend, whom he saw\r\nby the fire with his little Phemy upon his knee, to come out and speak\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nBlue Peter at once obeyed the summons.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s naething wrang, I houp, Ma\u2019colm?\u201D he said, as he closed the\r\ndoor behind him.\r\n\r\n\u201CMaister Graham wad say,\u201D returned Malcolm, \u201Cnaething ever was wrang\r\nbut what ye did wrang yersel\u2019, or wadna pit richt whan ye had a chance.\r\nI ha\u2019e him nae mair to gang till, Joseph, an\u2019 sae I\u2019m come to you. Come\r\ndoon by, an\u2019 i\u2019 the scoug o\u2019 a rock, I\u2019ll tell ye a\u2019 aboot it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYe wadna ha\u2019e the mistress no ken o\u2019 \u2019t?\u201D said his friend. \u201CI dinna\r\njist like haein\u2019 secrets frae _her_.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYe sall jeedge for yersel\u2019, man, an\u2019 tell her or no jist as ye like.\r\nOnly she maun haud her tongue, or the black dog\u2019ll ha\u2019e a\u2019 the butter.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe can haud her tongue like the tae-stane o\u2019 a grave,\u201D said Peter.\r\n\r\nAs they spoke they reached the cliff that hung over the shattered\r\nshore. It was a clear, cold night. Snow, the remnants of the last\r\nstorm, which frost had preserved in every shadowy spot, lay all about\r\nthem. The sky was clear, and full of stars, for the wind that blew\r\ncold from the north-west had dispelled the snowy clouds. The waves\r\nrushed into countless gulfs and crannies and straits on the ruggedest\r\nof shores, and the sounds of waves and wind kept calling like voices\r\nfrom the unseen. By a path, seemingly fitter for goats than men, they\r\ndescended half-way to the beach, and under a great projection of rock\r\nstood sheltered from the wind. Then Malcolm turned to Joseph Mair,\r\ncommonly called Blue Peter, because he had been a man-of-war\u2019s man, and\r\nlaying his hand on his arm said:\r\n\r\n\u201CBlue Peter, did ever I tell ye a lee?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, never,\u201D answered Peter. \u201CWhat gars ye speir sic a thing?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCause I want ye to believe me noo, an\u2019 it winna be easy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll believe onything ye tell me--\u2019at _can_ be believed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, I ha\u2019e come to the knowledge \u2019at my name\u2019s no MacPhail: it\u2019s\r\nColonsay. Man, I\u2019m the Markis o\u2019 Lossie.\u201D\r\n\r\nWithout a moment\u2019s hesitation, without a single stare of unbelief\r\nor even astonishment, Blue Peter pulled off his bonnet, and stood\r\nbareheaded before the companion of his toils.\r\n\r\n\u201CPeter!\u201D cried Malcolm, \u201Cdinna brak my hert: put on yer bonnet.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Lord o\u2019 lords be thankit, my lord!\u201D said Blue Peter: \u201Cthe puir man\r\nhas a freen\u2019 this day.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen replacing his bonnet he said--\r\n\r\n\u201CAn\u2019 what\u2019ll be yer lordship\u2019s wull?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFirst and foremost, Peter, that my best freen\u2019, efter my auld daddy\r\nand the schulemaister, \u2019s no to turn again\u2019 me \u2019cause I hed a markis\r\nan\u2019 neither piper nor fisher to my father.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s no like it, my lord,\u201D returned Blue Peter, \u201Cwhan the first thing\r\nI say is--what wad ye ha\u2019e o\u2019 me? Here I am--no speirin\u2019 a queston!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, I wad ha\u2019e ye hear the story o\u2019 \u2019t a\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSay on, my lord,\u201D said Peter.\r\n\r\nBut Malcolm was silent for a few moments.\r\n\r\n\u201CI was thinkin\u2019, Peter,\u201D he said at last, \u201Cwhether I cud bide to hear\r\nyou say _my lord_ to me. Dootless, as it\u2019ll ha\u2019e to come to that, it\r\nwad be better to grow used till \u2019t while we\u2019re thegither, sae \u2019at whan\r\nit maun be, it mayna ha\u2019e the luik o\u2019 cheenge intil it, for cheenge is\r\njist the thing I canna bide. I\u2019 the meantime, hooever, we canna gi\u2019e in\r\ntill \u2019t, \u2019cause it wad set fowk jaloosin\u2019. But I wad be obleeged till\r\nye, Peter, gien you wad say _my lord_ whiles, whan we\u2019re oor lanes,\r\nfor I wad fain grow sae used till \u2019t \u2019at I never kent ye said it, for\r\n\u2019atween you an\u2019 me, I dinna like it. An\u2019 noo I s\u2019 tell ye a\u2019 \u2019at I ken.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen he had ended the tale of what had come to his knowledge, and how\r\nit had come, and paused:\r\n\r\n\u201CGie \u2019s a grup o\u2019 yer han\u2019, my lord,\u201D said Blue Peter, \u201Can\u2019 may God\r\nhaud ye lang in life an\u2019 honour to reule ower us.

That\u2019s no, as ye promised,\r\nto be kin\u2019 till her. I canna believe that\u2019s hoo yer father expeckit\r\no\u2019 ye.

He\r\nanticipated its difficulties, but never thought of perils: it was\r\nseldom anything oppressed him but the doubt of what he ought to do.\r\nThis was ever the cold mist that swallowed the airy castles he built\r\nand peopled with all the friends and acquaintances of his youth. But\r\nthe very first step towards action is the death-warrant of doubt, and\r\nthe tide of Malcolm\u2019s being ran higher that night, as he stood thus\r\nalone under the stars, than he had ever yet known it run. With all\r\nhis common-sense, and the abundance of his philosophy, which the much\r\nleisure belonging to certain phases of his life had combined with\r\nthe slow strength of his intellect to render somewhat long-winded in\r\nutterance, there was yet room in Malcolm\u2019s bonnet for a bee above the\r\nordinary size, and if it buzzed a little too romantically for the taste\r\nof the nineteenth century, about disguises and surprises and bounty\r\nand plots and rescues and such like, something must be pardoned to\r\none whose experience had already been so greatly out of the common,\r\nand whose nature was far too child-like and poetic, and developed in\r\nfar too simple a surrounding of labour and success, difficulty and\r\nconquest, danger and deliverance, not to have more than the usual\r\namount of what is called _the romantic_ in its composition.\r\n\r\nThe buzzing of his bee was for the present interrupted by the return of\r\nBlue Peter with his wife. She threw her arms round Malcolm\u2019s neck, and\r\nburst into tears.\r\n\r\n\u201CHoots, my woman!\u201D said her husband, \u201Cwhat are ye greitin\u2019 at?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEh, Peter!\u201D she answered, \u201CI canna help it. It\u2019s jist like a deith.\r\nHe\u2019s gauin\u2019 to lea\u2019 us a\u2019, an\u2019 gang hame till \u2019s ain, an\u2019 I canna bide\r\n\u2019at he sud grow strange-like to hiz \u2019at ha\u2019e kenned him sae lang.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019ll be an ill day,\u201D returned Malcolm, \u201Cwhan I grow strange to ony\r\nfreen\u2019. I\u2019ll ha\u2019e to gang far down the laich (_low_) ro\u2019d afore that be\r\npoassible. I mayna aye be able to du jist what ye wad like; but lippen\r\nye to me: I s\u2019 be fair to ye. An\u2019 noo I want Blue Peter to gang wi\u2019 me,\r\nan\u2019 help me to what I ha\u2019e to du--gien ye ha\u2019e nae objection to lat\r\nhim.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNa, nane ha\u2019e I. I wad gang mysel\u2019 gien I cud be ony use,\u201D answered\r\nMrs Mair; \u201Cbut women are i\u2019 the gait whiles.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, I\u2019ll no even say thank ye; I\u2019ll be awin\u2019 ye that as weel \u2019s the\r\nlave. But gien I dinna du weel, it winna be the fau\u2019t o\u2019 ane or the\r\nither o\u2019 you twa freen\u2019s. Noo, Peter, we maun be aff.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo the nicht, surely?\u201D said Mrs Mair, a little taken by surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe suner the better, lass,\u201D replied her husband. \u201CAn\u2019 we cudna ha\u2019e a\r\nbetter win\u2019. Jist rin ye hame, an\u2019 get some vicktooals thegither, an\u2019\r\ncome efter hiz to Portlossie.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut hoo \u2019ill ye get the boat to the watter ohn mair han\u2019s? I\u2019ll need\r\nto come mysel\u2019 an\u2019 fess Jean.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNa, na; let Jean sit. There\u2019s plenty i\u2019 the Seaton to help. We\u2019re\r\ngauin\u2019 to tak the markis\u2019s cutter. She\u2019s a heap easier to lainch, an\u2019\r\nshe\u2019ll sail a heap fester.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut what\u2019ll Maister Crathie say?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe maun tak oor chance o\u2019 that,\u201D answered her husband, with a smile\r\nof confidence; and thereupon he and Malcolm set out for the Seaton,\r\nwhile Mrs Mair went home to get ready some provisions for the voyage,\r\nconsisting chiefly of oatcakes.\r\n\r\nThe prejudice against Malcolm from his imagined behaviour to Lizzy\r\nFindlay, had by this time, partly through the assurances of Peter,\r\npartly through the power of the youth\u2019s innocent presence, almost died\r\nout, and when the two men reached the Seaton, they found plenty of\r\nhands ready to help them to reach the little sloop. Malcolm said he was\r\ngoing to take her to Peterhead, and they asked no questions but such as\r\nhe contrived to answer with truth, or to leave unanswered. Once afloat,\r\nthere was very little to be done to her, for she had been laid up in\r\nperfect condition, and as soon as Mrs Mair appeared with her basket,\r\nand they had put that, a keg of water, some fishing-lines, and a pan of\r\nmussels for bait, on board, they were ready to sail, and wished their\r\nfriends a light good-bye, leaving them to imagine they were gone but\r\nfor a day or two, probably on some business of Mr Crathie\u2019s.\r\n\r\nWith the wind from the north-west, they soon reached Duff Harbour,\r\nwhere Malcolm went on shore and saw Mr Soutar. He, with a landsman\u2019s\r\nprejudice, made strenuous objections to such a mad prank as sailing to\r\nLondon at that time of the year, but in vain. Malcolm saw nothing mad\r\nin it, and the lawyer had to admit he ought to know best. He brought\r\non board with him a lad of Peter\u2019s acquaintance, and now fully manned,\r\nthey set sail again, and by the time the sun appeared were not far from\r\nPeterhead.\r\n\r\nMalcolm\u2019s spirits kept rising as they bowled along over the bright cold\r\nwaters. He never felt so capable as when at sea. His energies had been\r\nfirst called out in combat with the elements, and hence he always felt\r\nstrongest, most at home, and surest of himself on the water. Young\r\nas he was, however, such had been his training under Mr Graham, that\r\na large part of this elevation of spirit was owing to an unreasoned\r\nsense of being there more immediately in the hands of God. Later in\r\nlife, he interpreted the mental condition thus--that of course he was\r\nalways and in every place equally in God\u2019s hands, but that at sea he\r\nfelt the truth more keenly. Where a man has nothing firm under him,\r\nwhere his life depends on winds invisible and waters unstable, where\r\na single movement may be death, he learns to feel what is at the same\r\ntime just as true every night he spends asleep in the bed in which\r\ngenerations have slept before him, or any sunny hour he spends walking\r\nover ancestral acres.\r\n\r\nThey put in at Peterhead, purchased a few provisions, and again set\r\nsail.\r\n\r\nAnd now it seemed to Malcolm that he must soon come to a conclusion\r\nas to the steps he must take when he reached London. But think as\r\nhe would, he could plan nothing beyond finding out where his sister\r\nlived, going to look at the house, and getting into it if he might.\r\nNor could his companion help him with any suggestions, and indeed he\r\ncould not talk much with him because of the presence of Davy, a rough,\r\nround-eyed, red-haired young Scot, of the dull invaluable class that\r\ncan only do what they are told, but do that to the extent of their\r\nfaculty.\r\n\r\nThey knew all the coast as far as the Frith of Forth; after that they\r\nhad to be more careful. They had no charts on board, nor could have\r\nmade much use of any. But the wind continued favourable, and the\r\nweather cold, bright, and full of life. They spoke many coasters on\r\ntheir way, and received many directions.\r\n\r\nOff the Nore they had rough weather, and had to stand off and on for\r\na day and a night till it moderated. Then they spoke a fishing boat,\r\ntook a pilot on board, and were soon in smooth water. More and more\r\nthey wondered as the channel narrowed, and ended their voyage at length\r\nbelow London Bridge, in a very jungle of masts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nLONDON STREETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Davy to keep the sloop, the two fishermen went on shore.\r\nPassing from the narrow precincts of the river, they found themselves\r\nat once in the roar of London city. Stunned at first, then excited,\r\nthen bewildered, then dazed, without plan to guide their steps, they\r\nwandered about until, unused to the hard stones, their feet ached. It\r\nwas a dull day in March. A keen wind blew round the corners of the\r\nstreets. They wished themselves at sea again.\r\n\r\n\u201CSic a sicht o\u2019 fowk!\u201D said Blue Peter.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s hard to think,\u201D rejoined Malcolm, \u201Cwhat w\u2019y the God \u2019at made them\r\ncan luik efter them a\u2019 in sic a tumult. But they say even the sheep-dog\r\nkens ilk sheep i\u2019 the flock \u2019at\u2019s gien him in chairge.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, but ye see,\u201D said Blue Peter, \u201Cthey\u2019re mair like a shoal o\u2019\r\nherrin\u2019 nor a flock o\u2019 sheep.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s no the num\u2019er o\u2019 them \u2019at plagues me,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CThe gran\u2019\r\ndiffeeculty is hoo He can lat ilk ane tak his ain gait an\u2019 yet luik\r\nefter them a\u2019. But gien He does \u2019t, it stan\u2019s to rizzon it maun be in\r\nsome w\u2019y \u2019at them \u2019at\u2019s sae luikit efter canna by ony possibeelity\r\nun\u2019erstan\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s trowth, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019. We maun jist gi\u2019e up an\u2019 confess there\u2019s\r\nthings abune a\u2019 human comprehension.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWha kens but that may be \u2019cause i\u2019 their verra natur\u2019 they\u2019re ower\r\nsemple for craturs like hiz \u2019at\u2019s made sae mixed-like, an\u2019 see sae\r\nlittle intill the hert o\u2019 things?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYe\u2019re ayont me there,\u201D said Blue Peter, and a silence followed.\r\n\r\nIt was a conversation very unsuitable to London Streets--but then these\r\nwere raw Scotch fisherman, who had not yet learned how absurd it is to\r\nsuppose ourselves come from anything greater than ourselves, and had no\r\nconception of the liberty it confers on a man to know that he is the\r\nchild of a protoplasm, or something still more beautifully small.\r\n\r\nAt length a policeman directed them to a Scotch eating-house, where\r\nthey fared after their country\u2019s fashions, and from the landlady\r\ngathered directions by which to guide themselves towards Curzon Street,\r\na certain number in which Mr Soutar had given Malcolm as Lady Bellair\u2019s\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened to Malcolm\u2019s knock by a slatternly charwoman, who,\r\nunable to understand a word he said, would, but for its fine frank\r\nexpression, have shut the door in his face. From the expression of\r\nhers, however, Malcolm suddenly remembered that he must speak English,\r\nand having a plentiful store of the book sort, he at once made himself\r\nintelligible in spite of tone and accent. It was, however, only a\r\nshifting of the difficulty, for he now found it nearly impossible to\r\nunderstand her. But by repeated questioning and hard listening he\r\nlearnt at last that Lady Bellair had removed her establishment to Lady\r\nLossie\u2019s house in Portland Place.\r\n\r\nAfter many curious perplexities, odd blunders, and vain endeavours to\r\nunderstand shop signs and notices in the windows; after they had again\r\nand again imagined themselves back at a place they had left miles\r\naway; after many a useless effort to lay hold of directions given\r\nso rapidly that the very sense could not gather the sounds, they at\r\nlength stood--not in Portland Place, but in front of Westminster Abbey.\r\nInquiring what it was, and finding they could go in, they entered.\r\n\r\nFor some moments not a word was spoken between them, but when they\r\nhad walked slowly half-way up the nave, Malcolm turned and said, \u201CEh,\r\nPeter! sic a blessin\u2019!\u201D and Peter replied, \u201CThere canna be muckle o\u2019\r\nthis i\u2019 the warl\u2019!\u201D\r\n\r\nComparing impressions afterwards, Peter said that the moment he stepped\r\nin, he heard the rush of the tide on the rocks of Scaurnose; and\r\nMalcolm declared he felt as if he had stepped out of the world into the\r\nregions of eternal silence.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a mercy it maun be,\u201D he went on, \u201Cto mony a cratur, in sic a\r\nwhummle an\u2019 a rum\u2019le an\u2019 a remish as this Lon\u2019on, to ken \u2019at there is\r\nsic a cave howkit oot o\u2019 the din, \u2019at he can gang intill an\u2019 say his\r\nprayers intill! Man, Peter! I\u2019m jist some feared whiles \u2019at the verra\r\ndin i\u2019 my lugs mayna \u2019maist drive the thoucht o\u2019 God oot o\u2019 me.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt length they found their way into Regent Street, and leaving its mean\r\nassertion behind, reached the stately modesty of Portland Place; and\r\nMalcolm was pleased to think the house he sought was one of those he\r\nnow saw.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the largest in the Place. He would not, however, yield\r\nto the temptation to have a good look at it, for fear of attracting\r\nattention from its windows and being recognised. They turned therefore\r\naside into some of the smaller thoroughfares lying between Portland\r\nPlace and Great Portland Street, where searching about, they came upon\r\na decent-looking public house and inquired after lodgings. They were\r\ndirected to a woman in the neighbourhood, who kept a dingy little\r\ncuriosity-shop. On payment of a week\u2019s rent in advance, she allowed\r\nthem a small bedroom. But Malcolm did not want Peter with him that\r\nnight; he wished to be perfectly free; and besides it was more than\r\ndesirable that Peter should go and look after the boat and the boy.\r\n\r\nLeft alone he fell once more to his hitherto futile scheming: How was\r\nhe to get near his sister? To the whitest of lies he had insuperable\r\nobjection, and if he appeared before her with no reason to give, would\r\nshe not be far too offended with his presumption to retain him in her\r\nservice? And except he could be near her as her servant, he did not see\r\na chance of doing anything for her without disclosing facts which might\r\nmake all such service as he would most gladly render her impossible,\r\nby causing her to hate the very sight of him. Plan after plan rose and\r\npassed from his mind rejected, and the only resolution he could come to\r\nwas to write to Mr Soutar, to whom he had committed the protection of\r\nKelpie, to send her up by the first smack from Aberdeen. He did so, and\r\nwrote also to Miss Horn, telling her where he was, then went out, and\r\nmade his way back to Portland Place.\r\n\r\nNight had closed in, and thick vapours hid the moon, but lamps and\r\nlighted windows illuminated the wide street. Presently it began\r\nto snow. But through the snow and the night went carriages in all\r\ndirections, with great lamps that turned the flakes into white stars\r\nfor a moment as they gleamed past. The hoofs of the horses echoed hard\r\nfrom the firm road.\r\n\r\nCould that house really belong to him? It did, yet he dared not enter\r\nit. That which was dear and precious to him was in the house, and just\r\nbecause of that he could not call it his own. There was less light\r\nin it than in any other within his range. He walked up and down the\r\nopposite side of the street its whole length some fifty times, but saw\r\nno sign of vitality about the house. At length a brougham stopped at\r\nthe door, and a man got out and knocked. Malcolm instantly crossed, but\r\ncould not see his face. The door opened, and he entered. The brougham\r\nwaited. After about a quarter of an hour he came out again, accompanied\r\nby two ladies, one of whom he judged by her figure to be Florimel. They\r\nall got into the carriage, and Malcolm braced himself for a terrible\r\nrun. But the coachman drove carefully, the snow lay a few inches deep,\r\nand he found no difficulty in keeping near them, following with fleet\r\nfoot and husbanded breath.\r\n\r\nThey stopped at the doors of a large dark-looking building in a narrow\r\nstreet. He thought it was a church, and wondered that so his sister\r\nshould be going there on a week night. Nor did the aspect of the\r\nentrance hall, into which he followed them, undeceive him. It was more\r\nshowy, certainly, than the vestibule of any church he had ever been\r\nin before, but what might not churches be in London? They went up a\r\ngreat flight of stairs--to reach the gallery, as he thought, and still\r\nhe went after them. When he reached the top, they were just vanishing\r\nround a curve, and his advance was checked: a man came up to him, said\r\nhe could not come there, and gruffly requested him to show his ticket.\r\n\r\n\u201CI haven\u2019t got one. What is this place?\u201D said Malcolm, whom the aspect\r\nof the man had suddenly rendered doubtful, mouthing his English with\r\nScotch deliberation.\r\n\r\nThe man gave him a look of contemptuous surprise, and turning to\r\nanother who lounged behind him with his hands in his pockets, said--\r\n\r\n\u201CTom, here\u2019s a gentleman as wants to know where he is: can you tell\r\nhim?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe person addressed laughed, and gave Malcolm a queer look.\r\n\r\n\u201CEvery cock crows on his own midden,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cbut if I were on\r\nmine, I would try to be civil.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou go down there, and pay for a pit ticket, and you\u2019ll soon know\r\nwhere you are, mate,\u201D said Tom.\r\n\r\nHe obeyed, and after a few inquiries, and the outlay of two shillings,\r\nfound himself in the pit of one of the largest of the London theatres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe play was begun, and the stage was the centre of light. Thither\r\nMalcolm\u2019s eyes were drawn the instant he entered. He was all but\r\nunaware of the multitude of faces about him, and his attention was\r\nat once fascinated by the lovely show revealed in soft radiance. But\r\nsurely he had seen the vision before! One long moment its effect\r\nupon him was as real as if he had been actually deceived as to\r\nits nature: was it not the shore between Scaurnose and Portlossie,\r\nbetwixt the Boar\u2019s Tail and the sea? and was not that the marquis,\r\nhis father, in his dressing gown, pacing to and fro upon the\r\nsands? He yielded himself to illusion--abandoned himself to the\r\nwonderful, and looked only for what would come next.\r\n\r\nA lovely lady entered: to his excited fancy it was Florimel. A\r\nmoment more and she spoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If by your art, my dearest father, you have\r\n  Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen first he understood that before him rose in wondrous realization\r\nthe play of Shakspere he knew best--the first he had ever read: _The\r\nTempest_, hitherto a lovely phantom for the mind\u2019s eye, now embodied\r\nto the enraptured sense. During the whole of the first act he never\r\nthought either of Miranda or Florimel apart. At the same time so taken\r\nwas he with the princely carriage and utterance of Ferdinand that,\r\nthough with a sigh, he consented he should have his sister.\r\n\r\nThe drop-scene had fallen for a minute or two before he began to look\r\naround him. A moment more and he had commenced a thorough search for\r\nhis sister amongst the ladies in the boxes. But when at length he found\r\nher, he dared not fix his eyes upon her lest his gaze should make\r\nher look at him, and she should recognise him. Alas, her eyes might\r\nhave rested on him twenty times without his face once rousing in her\r\nmind the thought of the fisher-lad of Portlossie! All that had passed\r\nbetween them in the days already old was virtually forgotten.\r\n\r\nBy degrees he gathered courage, and soon began to feel that there was\r\nsmall chance indeed of her eyes alighting upon him for the briefest of\r\nmoments. Then he looked more closely, and felt through rather than saw\r\nwith his eyes that some sort of change had already passed upon her. It\r\nwas Florimel, yet not the very Florimel he had known. Already something\r\nhad begun to supplant the girl-freedom that had formerly in every look\r\nand motion asserted itself. She was more beautiful, but not so lovely\r\nin his eyes; much of what had charmed him had vanished. She was more\r\nstately, but the stateliness had a little hardness mingled with it:\r\nand could it be that the first of a cloud had already gathered on her\r\nforehead? Surely she was not so happy as she had been at Lossie House.\r\nShe was dressed in black, with a white flower in her hair.\r\n\r\nBeside her sat the bold-faced countess, and behind them her nephew,\r\nLord Meikleham that was now Lord Liftore. A fierce indignation seized\r\nthe heart of Malcolm at the sight. Behind the form of the earl, his\r\nmind\u2019s eye saw that of Lizzy, out in the wind on the Boar\u2019s Tail, her\r\nold shawl wrapped about herself and the child of the man who sat there\r\nso composed and comfortable. His features were fine and clear-cut,\r\nhis shoulders broad, and his head well set: he had much improved\r\nsince Malcolm offered to fight him with one hand in the dining-room\r\nof Lossie House. Every now and then he leaned forward between his\r\naunt and Florimel, and spoke to the latter. To Malcolm\u2019s eyes she\r\nseemed to listen with some haughtiness. Now and then she cast him an\r\nindifferent glance. Malcolm was pleased: Lord Liftore was anything but\r\nthe Ferdinand to whom he could consent to yield his Miranda. They would\r\nmake a fine couple certainly, but for any other fitness, knowing what\r\nhe did, Malcolm was glad to perceive none. The more annoyed was he when\r\nonce or twice he fancied he caught a look between them that indicated\r\nmore than acquaintanceship-- some sort of intimacy at least. But he\r\nreflected that in the relation in which they stood to Lady Bellair it\r\ncould hardly be otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe play was tolerably well put upon the stage, and free of the\r\nabsurdities attendant upon too ambitious an endeavour to represent\r\nto the sense things which Shakspere and the dramatists of his period\r\nfreely committed to their best and most powerful ally, the willing\r\nimagination of the spectators. The opening of the last scene, where\r\nFerdinand and Miranda are discovered at chess, was none the less\r\neffective for its simplicity, and Malcolm was turning from a delighted\r\ngaze at its loveliness to glance at his sister and her companions, when\r\nhis eyes fell on a face near him in the pit which had fixed an absorbed\r\nregard in the same direction. It was that of a man a few years older\r\nthan himself, with irregular features, but a fine mouth, large chin;\r\nand great forehead. Under the peculiarly prominent eyebrows shone dark\r\neyes of wondrous brilliancy and seeming penetration. Malcolm could not\r\nbut suspect that his gaze was upon his sister, but as they were a long\r\nway from the boxes, he could not be certain. Once he thought he saw her\r\nlook at him, but of that also he could be in no wise certain.\r\n\r\nHe knew the play so well that he rose just in time to reach the\r\npit-door ere exit should be impeded with the outcomers, and thence with\r\nsome difficulty he found his way to the foot of the stair up which\r\nthose he watched had gone. There he had stood but a little while, when\r\nhe saw in front of him, almost within reach of an outstretched hand,\r\nthe same young man waiting also. After what seemed a long time, he saw\r\nhis sister and her two companions come slowly down the stair in the\r\ndescending crowd. Her eyes seemed searching amongst the multitude that\r\nfilled the lobby. Presently an indubitable glance of still recognition\r\npassed between them, and by a slight movement the young man placed\r\nhimself so that she must pass next him in the crowd. Malcolm got one\r\nplace nearer in the change, and thought they grasped hands. She turned\r\nher head slightly back, and seemed to put a question--with her lips\r\nonly. He replied in the same manner. A light rushed into her face and\r\nvanished. But not a feature moved and not a word had been spoken.\r\nNeither of her companions had seen the dumb show, and her friend stood\r\nwhere he was till they had left the house. Malcolm stood also, much\r\ninclined to follow him when he went, but, his attention having been\r\nattracted for a moment in another direction, when he looked again he\r\nhad disappeared. He sought him where he fancied he saw the movement\r\nof his vanishing, but was soon convinced of the uselessness of the\r\nattempt, and walked home.\r\n\r\nBefore he reached his lodging, he had resolved on making trial of a\r\nplan which had more than once occurred to him, but had as often been\r\nrejected as too full of the risk of repulse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDEMON AND THE PIPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis plan was to watch the house until he saw some entertainment going\r\non, then present himself as if he had but just arrived from her\r\nladyship\u2019s country seat. At such a time no one would acquaint her with\r\nhis appearance, and he would, as if it were but a matter of course, at\r\nonce take his share in waiting on the guests. By this means he might\r\nperhaps get her a little accustomed to his presence before she could be\r\nat leisure to challenge it.\r\n\r\nWhen he put Kelpie in her stall the last time for a season, and ran\r\ninto the house to get his plaid for Lizzy, who was waiting him near\r\nthe tunnel, he bethought himself that he had better take with him also\r\nwhat other of his personal requirements he could carry. He looked about\r\ntherefore, and finding a large carpet-bag in one of the garret rooms,\r\nhurried into it some of his clothes--amongst them the Highland dress he\r\nhad worn as henchman to the marquis, and added the great Lossie pipes\r\nhis father had given to old Duncan as well, but which the piper had\r\nnot taken with him when he left Lossie House. The said Highland dress\r\nhe now resolved to put on, as that in which latterly Florimel had been\r\nmost used to see him: in it he would watch his opportunity of gaining\r\nadmission to the house.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Blue Peter made his appearance early. They went\r\nout together, spent the day in sight-seeing, and, on Malcolm\u2019s part\r\nchiefly, in learning the topography of London.\r\n\r\nIn Hyde Park Malcolm told his friend that he had sent for Kelpie.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019ll be the deid o\u2019 ye i\u2019 thae streets, as fu\u2019 o\u2019 wheels as the sea\r\no\u2019 fish: twize I\u2019ve been \u2019maist gr\u2019un to poother o\u2019 my ro\u2019d here,\u201D said\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, but ye see, oot here amo\u2019 the gentry it\u2019s no freely sae ill, an\u2019\r\nthe ro\u2019ds are no a\u2019 stane; an\u2019 here, ye see, \u2019s the place whaur they\r\ncome, leddies an\u2019 a\u2019, to ha\u2019e their rides thegither. What I\u2019m fleyt for\r\nis \u2019at she\u2019ll be brackin\u2019 legs wi\u2019 her deevilich kickin\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHaud her upo\u2019 dry strae an\u2019 watter for a whilie, till her banes begin\r\nto cry oot for something to hap them frae the cauld: that\u2019ll quaiet her\r\na bit,\u201D said Peter.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a\u2019 ye ken!\u201D returned Malcolm. \u201CShe\u2019s aye the wau-natur\u2019d, the\r\nless she has to ate. Na, na; she maun be weel lined. The deevil in her\r\nmaun lie warm, or she\u2019ll be neither to haud nor bin\u2019. There\u2019s nae doobt\r\nshe\u2019s waur to haud in whan she\u2019s in guid condeetion; but she\u2019s nane sae\r\nlike to tak a body by the sma\u2019 o\u2019 the back, an\u2019 shak the inside oot o\u2019\r\n\u2019im, as she maist did ae day to the herd-laddie at the ferm, only he\r\nhad an auld girth aboot the mids o\u2019 \u2019im for a belt, an\u2019 he tuik the\r\nless scaith.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCudna we gang an\u2019 see the maister the day?\u201D said Blue Peter, changing\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nHe meant Mr Graham, the late schoolmaster of Portlossie, whom the\r\ncharge of heretical teaching had driven from the place.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe canna weel du that till we hear whaur he is. The last time Miss\r\nHorn h\u2019ard frae him, he was changin\u2019 his lodgin\u2019s, an\u2019 ye see the kin\u2019\r\no\u2019 a place this Lon\u2019on is,\u201D answered Malcolm.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Peter was gone to return to the boat, Malcolm dressed\r\nhimself in his kilt and its belongings, and when it was fairly dusk,\r\ntook his pipes under his arm, and set out for Portland Place. He\r\nhad the better hope of speedy success to his plan, that he fancied\r\nhe had read on his sister\u2019s lips, in the silent communication that\r\npassed between her and her friend in the crowd, the words _come_ and\r\n_to-morrow_. It might have been the merest imagination, yet it was\r\nsomething: how often have we not to be grateful for shadows! Up and\r\ndown the street he walked a long time, without seeing a sign of life\r\nabout the house. But at length the hall was lighted. Then the door\r\nopened, and a servant rolled out a carpet over the wide pavement, which\r\nthe snow had left wet and miry--a signal for the street children,\r\never on the outlook for sights, to gather. Before the first carriage\r\narrived, there was already a little crowd of humble watchers and\r\nwaiters about the gutter and curb-stone. But they were not destined to\r\nmuch amusement that evening, the visitors amounting only to a small\r\ndinner-party. Still they had the pleasure of seeing a few grand ladies\r\nissue from their carriages, cross the stage of their Epiphany, the\r\npavement, and vanish in the paradise of the shining hall, with its\r\nascent of gorgeous stairs. No broken steps, no missing balusters there!\r\nAnd they have the show all for nothing! It is one of the perquisites of\r\nstreet-service. What one would give to see the shapes glide over the\r\nfield of those camer\u00E6 obscur\u00E6, the hearts of the street Arabs! once to\r\ngaze on the jewelled beauties through the eyes of those shocked-haired\r\ngirls! I fancy they do not often begrudge them what they possess,\r\nexcept perhaps when feature or hair or motion chances to remind them of\r\nsome one of their own people, and they feel wronged and indignant that\r\n_she_ should flaunt in such splendour, \u201Cwhen _our Sally_ would set off\r\ngrand clothes so much better!\u201D It is neither the wealth nor the general\r\nconsequence it confers that they envy, but, as I imagine, the power of\r\nmaking a show--of living in the eyes and knowledge of neighbours for a\r\nfew radiant moments: nothing is so pleasant to ordinary human nature\r\nas to know itself by its reflection from others. When it turns from\r\nthese warped and broken mirrors to seek its reflection in the divine\r\nthought, then it is redeemed; then it beholds itself in the perfect law\r\nof liberty.\r\n\r\nBefore he became himself an object of curious interest to the crowd\r\nhe was watching, Malcolm had come to the same conclusion with many a\r\nphilosopher and observer of humanity before him--that on the whole the\r\nrags are inhabited by the easier hearts; and he would have arrived at\r\nthe conclusion with more certainty but for the _high_ training that\r\ncuts off intercourse between heart and face.\r\n\r\nWhen some time had elapsed, and no more carriages appeared, Malcolm,\r\njudging the dinner must now be in full vortex, rang the bell of the\r\nfront door. It was opened by a huge footman, whose head was so small in\r\nproportion that his body seemed to have absorbed it. Malcolm would have\r\nstepped in at once, and told what of his tale he chose at his leisure;\r\nbut the servant, who had never seen the dress Malcolm wore, except on\r\nstreet-beggars, with the instinct his class shares with watch-dogs,\r\nquickly closed the door. Ere it reached the post, however, it found\r\nMalcolm\u2019s foot between.\r\n\r\n\u201CGo along, Scotchy. You\u2019re not wanted here,\u201D said the man, pushing the\r\ndoor hard. \u201CPolice is round the corner.\u201D\r\n\r\nNow one of the weaknesses Malcolm owed to his Celtic blood was an utter\r\nimpatience of rudeness. In his own nature entirely courteous, he was\r\nwrathful even to absurdity at the slightest suspicion of insult. But\r\nthat, in part through the influence of Mr Graham, the schoolmaster,\r\nhe had learned to keep a firm hold on the reins of action, this\r\nfoolish feeling would not unfrequently have hurried him into conduct\r\nundignified. On the present occasion, I fear the main part of his\r\nanswer, but for the shield of the door, would have been a blow to fell\r\na bigger man than the one that now glared at him through the shoe-broad\r\nopening. As it was, his words were fierce with suppressed wrath.\r\n\r\n\u201COpen the door, an\u2019 lat me in,\u201D was, however, all he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s your business?\u201D asked the man, on whom his tone had its effect.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy business is with my Lady Lossie,\u201D said Malcolm, recovering his\r\nEnglish, which was one step towards mastering, if not recovering, his\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou can\u2019t see her. She\u2019s at dinner.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLet me in, and I\u2019ll wait. I come from Lossie House.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTake away your foot and I\u2019ll go and see,\u201D said the man.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo. You open the door,\u201D returned Malcolm.\r\n\r\nThe man\u2019s answer was an attempt to kick his foot out of the doorway. If\r\nhe were to let in a tramp, what would the butler say?\r\n\r\nBut thereupon Malcolm set his port-vent to his mouth, rapidly filled\r\nhis bag, while the man stared as if it were a petard with which he was\r\nabout to blow the door to shivers, and then sent from the instrument\r\nsuch a shriek, as it galloped off into the Lossie Gathering, that\r\ninvoluntarily his adversary pressed both hands to his ears. With a\r\nsudden application of his knee Malcolm sent the door wide, and entered\r\nthe hall, with his pipes in full cry. The house resounded with their\r\nyell--but only for one moment. For down the stair, like bolt from\r\ncatapult, came Demon, Florimel\u2019s huge Irish stag-hound, and springing\r\non Malcolm, put an instant end to his music. The footman laughed with\r\nexultation, expecting to see him torn to pieces. But when instead\r\nhe saw the fierce animal, a foot on each of his shoulders, licking\r\nMalcolm\u2019s face with long fiery tongue, he began to doubt.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe dog knows you,\u201D he said sulkily.\r\n\r\n\u201CSo shall you, before long,\u201D returned Malcolm. \u201CWas it my fault that I\r\nmade the mistake of looking for civility from you? One word to the dog,\r\nand he has you by the throat.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll go and fetch Wallis,\u201D said the man, and closing the door, left\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\nNow this Wallis had been a fellow-servant of Malcolm\u2019s at Lossie House,\r\nbut he did not know that he had gone with Lady Bellair when she took\r\nFlorimel away: almost everyone had left at the same time. He was now\r\nglad indeed to learn that there was one amongst the servants who knew\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWallis presently made his appearance, with a dish in his hands, on his\r\nway to the dining-room, from which came the confused noises of the\r\nfeast.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll be come up to wait on Lady Lossie,\u201D he said. \u201CI haven\u2019t a\r\nmoment to speak to you now, for we\u2019re at dinner, and there\u2019s a party.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever mind me. Give me that dish; I\u2019ll take it in: you can go for\r\nanother,\u201D said Malcolm, laying his pipes in a safe spot.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou can\u2019t go into the dining-room that figure,\u201D said Wallis, who was\r\nin the Bellair livery.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is how I waited on my lord,\u201D returned Malcolm, \u201Cand this is how\r\nI\u2019ll wait on my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\nWallis hesitated. But there was that about the fisher-fellow was too\r\nmuch for him. As he spoke, Malcolm took the dish from his hands, and\r\nwith it walked into the dining-room.\r\n\r\nThere one reconnoitring glance was sufficient. The butler was at the\r\nsideboard opening a champagne bottle. He had cut wire and strings,\r\nand had his hand on the cork as Malcolm walked up to him. It was a\r\ncritical moment, yet he stopped in the very article, and stared at the\r\napparition.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m Lady Lossie\u2019s man from Lossie House. I\u2019ll help you to wait,\u201D said\r\nMalcolm.\r\n\r\nTo the eyes of the butler he looked a savage. But there he was in the\r\nroom with the dish in his hands, and speaking at least intelligibly;\r\nthe cork of the champagne bottle was pushing hard against his palm, and\r\nhe had no time to question. He peeped into Malcolm\u2019s dish.\r\n\r\n\u201CTake it round, then,\u201D he said. So Malcolm settled into the business of\r\nthe hour.\r\n\r\nIt was some time, after he knew where she was, before he ventured to\r\nlook at his sister: he would have her already familiarised with his\r\npresence before their eyes met. That crisis did not arrive during\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nLord Liftore was one of the company, and so, to Malcolm\u2019s pleasure,\r\nfor he felt in him an ally against the earl, was Florimel\u2019s mysterious\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nA NEW LIVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had the ladies gone to the drawing-room, when Florimel\u2019s maid,\r\nwho knew Malcolm, came in quest of him. Lady Lossie desired to see him.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is the meaning of this, MacPhail?\u201D she said, when he entered the\r\nroom where she sat alone. \u201CI did not send for you. Indeed, I thought\r\nyou had been dismissed with the rest of the servants.\u201D\r\n\r\nHow differently she spoke! And she used to call him _Malcolm_! The girl\r\nFlorimel was gone, and there sat--the marchioness, was it? --or some\r\nphase of riper womanhood only? It mattered little to Malcolm. He was no\r\ncurious student of man or woman. He loved his kind too well to study\r\nit. But one thing seemed plain: she had forgotten the half friendship\r\nand whole service that had had place betwixt them, and it made him feel\r\nas if the soul of man no less than his life were but as a vapour that\r\nappeareth for a little and then vanisheth away.\r\n\r\nBut Florimel had not so entirely forgotten the past as Malcolm\r\nthought--not so entirely at least but that his appearance, and certain\r\ndifficulties in which she had begun to find herself, brought something\r\nof it again to her mind.\r\n\r\n\u201CI thought,\u201D said Malcolm, assuming his best English, \u201Cyour ladyship\r\nmight not choose to part with an old servant at the will of a factor,\r\nand so took upon me to appeal to your ladyship to decide the question.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut how is that? Did you not return to your fishing when the household\r\nwas broken up?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, my lady. Mr Crathie kept me to help Stoat, and do odd jobs about\r\nthe place.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd now he wants to discharge you?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Malcolm told her the whole story, in which he gave such a\r\ndescription of Kelpie, that her owner, as she imagined herself,\r\nexpressed a strong wish to see her; for Florimel was almost\r\npassionately fond of horses.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou may soon do that, my lady,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CMr Soutar, not being\r\nof the same mind as Mr Crathie, is going to send her up. It will be\r\nbut the cost of the passage from Aberdeen, and she will fetch a better\r\nprice here if your ladyship should resolve to part with her. She won\u2019t\r\nfetch the third of her value anywhere, though, on account of her bad\r\ntemper and ugly tricks.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut as to yourself, MacPhail--where are you going to go?\u201D said\r\nFlorimel. \u201CI don\u2019t like to send you away, but, if I keep you, I don\u2019t\r\nknow what to do with you. No doubt you could serve in the house, but\r\nthat would not be suitable at all to your education and previous life.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA body wad tak you for a granny grown!\u201D said Malcolm to himself. But\r\nto Florimel he replied--\u201CIf your ladyship should wish to keep Kelpie,\r\nyou will have to keep me too, for not a creature else will she let near\r\nher.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd pray tell me what use then can I make of such an animal,\u201D said\r\nFlorimel.\r\n\r\n\u201CYour ladyship, I should imagine, will want a groom to attend you when\r\nyou are out on horseback, and the groom will want a horse-- and here am\r\nI and Kelpie!\u201D answered Malcolm.\r\n\r\nFlorimel laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201CI see,\u201D she said. \u201CYou contrive I shall have a horse nobody can manage\r\nbut yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe rather liked the idea of a groom so mounted, and had too much\r\nwell-justified faith in Malcolm to anticipate dangerous results.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady,\u201D said Malcolm, appealing to her knowledge of his character to\r\nsecure credit, for he was about to use his last means of persuasion,\r\nand as he spoke, in his eagerness he relapsed into his mother\r\ntongue,--\u201CMy lady, did I ever tell ye a lee?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly not, Malcolm, so far as I know. Indeed I am sure you never\r\ndid,\u201D answered Florimel, looking up at him in a dominant yet kindly way.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen,\u201D continued Malcolm, \u201CI\u2019ll tell your ladyship something you\r\nmay find hard to believe, and yet is as true as that I loved your\r\nladyship\u2019s father.--Your ladyship knows he had a kindness for me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do know it,\u201D answered Florimel gently, moved by the tone of\r\nMalcolm\u2019s voice, and the expression of his countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen I make bold to tell your ladyship that on his deathbed your\r\nfather desired me to do my best for you--took my word that I would be\r\nyour ladyship\u2019s true servant.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs it so, indeed, Malcolm?\u201D returned Florimel, with a serious wonder\r\nin her tone, and looked him in the face with an earnest gaze. She had\r\nloved her father, and it sounded in her ears almost like a message from\r\nthe tomb.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s as true as I stan\u2019 here, my leddy,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\nFlorimel was silent for a moment. Then she said, \u201CHow is it that only\r\nnow you come to tell me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYour father never desired me to tell you, my lady--only he never\r\nimagined you would want to part with me, I suppose. But when you did\r\nnot care to keep me, and never said a word to me when you went away,\r\nI could not tell how to do as I had promised him. It wasn\u2019t that one\r\nhour I forgot his wish, but that I feared to presume; for if I should\r\ndisplease your ladyship my chance was gone. So I kept about Lossie\r\nHouse as long as I could, hoping to see my way to some plan or other.\r\nBut when at length Mr Crathie turned me away, what was I to do but come\r\nto your ladyship? And if your ladyship will let things be as before\r\nin the way of service, I mean--I canna doot, my leddy, but it\u2019ll be\r\npleesant i\u2019 the sicht o\u2019 yer father, whanever he may come to ken o\u2019 \u2019t,\r\nmy leddy.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel gave him a strange, half-startled look. Hardly more than once\r\nsince her father\u2019s funeral had she heard him alluded to, and now this\r\nfisher-lad spoke of him as if he were still at Lossie House.\r\n\r\nMalcolm understood the look.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe mean, my leddy--I ken what ye mean,\u201D he said. \u201CI canna help it. For\r\nto lo\u2019e onything is to ken \u2019t immortal. He\u2019s livin\u2019 to me, my leddy.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel continued staring, and still said nothing.\r\n\r\nI sometimes think that the present belief in mortality is nothing but\r\nthe almost universal although unsuspected unbelief in immortality grown\r\nvocal and articulate.\r\n\r\nBut Malcolm gathered courage and went on,\r\n\r\n\u201CAn\u2019 what for no, my leddy?\u201D he said, floundering no more in attempted\r\nEnglish, but soaring on the clumsy wings of his mother-dialect. \u201CDidna\r\nhe turn his face to the licht afore he dee\u2019d? an\u2019 him \u2019at rase frae\r\nthe deid said \u2019at whaever believed in him sud never dee. Sae we maun\r\nbelieve \u2019at he\u2019s livin\u2019, for gien we dinna believe what _he_ says, what\r\n_are_ we to believe, my leddy?\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel continued yet a moment looking him fixedly in the face. The\r\nthought did arise that perhaps he had lost his reason, but she could\r\nnot look at him thus and even imagine it. She remembered how strange\r\nhe had always been, and for a moment had a glimmering idea that in\r\nthis young man\u2019s friendship she possessed an incorruptible treasure.\r\nThe calm, truthful, believing, almost for the moment enthusiastic,\r\nexpression of the young fisherman\u2019s face wrought upon her with a\r\nstrangely quieting influence. It was as if one spoke to her out of a\r\nregion of existence of which she had never even heard, but in whose\r\nreality she was compelled to believe because of the sound of the voice\r\nthat came from it.\r\n\r\nMalcolm seldom made the mistake of stamping into the earth any seeds of\r\ntruth he might cast on it: he knew when to say no more, and for a time\r\nneither spoke. But now for all the coolness of her upper crust, Lady\r\nFlorimel\u2019s heart glowed--not indeed with the power of the shining truth\r\nMalcolm had uttered, but with the light of gladness in the possession\r\nof such a strong, devoted, disinterested squire.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish you to understand,\u201D she said at length, \u201Cthat I am not at\r\npresent mistress of this house, although it belongs to me. I am but\r\nthe guest of Lady Bellair who has rented it of my guardians. I cannot\r\ntherefore arrange for you to be here. But you can find accommodation\r\nin the neighbourhood, and come to me every day for orders. Let me know\r\nwhen your mare arrives: I shall not want you till then. You will find\r\nroom for her in the stables. You had better consult the butler about\r\nyour groom\u2019s-livery.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm was astonished at the womanly sufficiency with which she gave\r\nher orders. He left her with the gladness of one who has had his\r\nrighteous desire, held consultation with the butler on the matter\r\nof the livery, and went home to his lodging. There he sat down and\r\nmeditated.\r\n\r\nA strange new yearning pity rose in his heart as he thought about his\r\nsister and the sad facts of her lonely condition. He feared much that\r\nher stately composure was built mainly on her imagined position in\r\nsociety, and was not the outcome of her character. Would it be cruelty\r\nto destroy that false foundation, hardly the more false as a foundation\r\nfor composure that beneath it lay a mistake? --or was it not rather\r\na justice which her deeper and truer self had a right to demand of\r\nhim? At present, however, he need not attempt to answer the question.\r\nCommunication even such as a trusted groom might have with her, and\r\nfamiliarity with her surroundings, would probably reveal much. Meantime\r\nit was enough that he would now be so near her that no important change\r\nof which others might be aware, could well approach her without his\r\nknowledge, or anything take place without his being able to interfere\r\nif necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTWO CONVERSATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Wallis came to see Malcolm and take him to the tailor\u2019s.\r\nThey talked about the guests of the previous evening.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a great change on Lord Meikleham,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is that,\u201D said Wallis. \u201CI consider him much improved. But\r\nyou see he\u2019s succeeded; he\u2019s the earl now, and Lord Liftore--and a\r\nmenseful, broad-shouldered man to the boot of the bargain. He used to\r\nbe such a windle-straw!\u201D\r\n\r\nIn order to speak good English, Wallis now and then, like some Scotch\r\npeople of better education, anglicized a word ludicrously.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs there no news of his marriage?\u201D asked Malcolm, adding, \u201Cthey say he\r\nhas great property.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy love she\u2019s but a lassie yet,\u201D said Wallis, \u201C--though she too has\r\nchanged quite as much as my lord.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho are you speaking of?\u201D asked Malcolm, anxious to hear the talk of\r\nthe household on the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, Lady Lossie, of course. Anybody with half an eye can see as much\r\nas that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs it settled then?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat would be hard to say. Her ladyship is too like her father: no one\r\ncan tell what may be her mind the next minute. But, as I say, she\u2019s\r\nyoung, and ought to have her fling first--so far, that is, as we can\r\npermit it to a woman of her rank. Still, as I say, anybody with half\r\nan eye can see the end of it all: he\u2019s for ever hovering about her. My\r\nlady, too, has set her mind on it, and for my part I can\u2019t see what\r\nbetter she can do. I must say I approve of the match. I can see no\r\npossible objection to it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe used to think he drank too much,\u201D suggested Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CClaret,\u201D said Wallis, in a tone that seemed to imply no one could\r\ndrink too much of that.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, not claret only. I\u2019ve seen the whisky follow the claret.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, he don\u2019t now--not whisky at least. He don\u2019t drink too much--not\r\nmuch too much--not more than a gentleman should. He don\u2019t look like\r\nit--does he now? A good wife, such as my Lady Lossie will make him,\r\nwill soon set him all right. I think of taking a similar protection\r\nmyself, one of these days.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is not worthy of her,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I confess his family won\u2019t compare with hers. There\u2019s a\r\ngrandfather in it somewhere that was a banker or a brewer or a soap\r\nboiler, or something of the sort, and she and her people have been\r\nearls and marquises ever since they walked arm in arm out of the ark.\r\nBut, bless you! all that\u2019s been changed since I came to town. So long\r\nas there\u2019s plenty of money and the mind to spend it, we have learned\r\nnot to be exclusive. It\u2019s selfish that. It\u2019s not Christian. Everything\r\nlies in the mind to spend it though. Mrs Tredger-- that\u2019s our\r\nlady\u2019s-maid--only this is a secret--says it\u2019s all settled--she knows it\r\nfor certain fact--only there\u2019s nothing to be said about it yet--she\u2019s\r\nso young, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho was the man that sat nearly opposite my lady, on the other side of\r\nthe table?\u201D asked Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CI know who you mean. Didn\u2019t look as if he\u2019d got any business there\r\n--not like the rest of them, did he? No, they never do. Odd and end\r\nsort of people like he is, never do look the right thing-- let them try\r\never so hard. How can they when they ain\u2019t it? That\u2019s a fellow that\u2019s\r\npainting Lady Lossie\u2019s portrait! Why he should be asked to dinner for\r\nthat, I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t tell. He ain\u2019t paid for it in victuals, is he?\r\nI never saw such land leapers let into Lossie House, _I_ know! But\r\nLondon\u2019s an awful place. There\u2019s no such a thing as respect of persons\r\nhere. Here you meet the butcher, the baker, the candlestick-maker, any\r\nnight in my lady\u2019s drawing-room. I declare to _you_, Mawlcolm MacPhail,\r\nit makes me quite uncomfortable at times to think who I may have been\r\nwaiting upon without knowing it. For that painter-fellow, Lenorme they\r\ncall him, I could knock him on the teeth with the dish every time I\r\nhold it to him. And to see him stare at Lady Lossie as he does!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA painter must want to get a right good hold of the face he\u2019s got to\r\npaint,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CIs he here often?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s been here five or six times already,\u201D answered Wallis, \u201Cand how\r\nmany times more I may have to fill his glass, I don\u2019t know. _I_ always\r\ngive him second-best sherry, _I_ know. I\u2019m sure the time that pictur\u2019s\r\nbeen on hand! He ought to be ashamed of himself. If she\u2019s been once\r\nto his studio, she\u2019s been twenty times--to give him sittings, as they\r\ncall it. He\u2019s making a pretty penny of it, I\u2019ll be bound! I wonder he\r\nhas the cheek to show himself when my lady treats him so haughtily. But\r\nthose sort of people have no proper feelin\u2019s, you see: it\u2019s not to be\r\nexpected of such.\u201D\r\n\r\nWallis liked the sound of his own sentences, and a great deal more talk\r\nof similar character followed before they got back from the tailor\u2019s.\r\nMalcolm was tired enough of him, and never felt the difference between\r\nman and man more strongly than when, after leaving him, he set out\r\nfor a walk with Blue Peter, whom he found waiting him at his lodging.\r\nOn this same Blue Peter, however, Wallis would have looked down\r\nfrom the height of his share of the marquisate as one of the lower\r\norders--ignorant, vulgar, even dirty.\r\n\r\nThey had already gazed together upon not a few of the marvels of\r\nLondon, but nothing had hitherto moved or drawn them so much as the\r\nordinary flow of the currents of life through the huge city. Upon\r\nMalcolm, however, this had now begun to pall, while Peter already\r\nfound it worse than irksome, and longed for Scaurnose. At the same\r\ntime loyalty to Malcolm kept him from uttering a whisper of his\r\nhome-sickness. It was yet but the fourth day they had been in London.\r\n\r\n\u201CEh, my lord!\u201D said Blue Peter, when by chance they found themselves\r\nin the lull of a little quiet court, somewhere about Gray\u2019s Inn, with\r\nthe roar of Holborn in their ears, \u201Cit\u2019s like a month sin\u2019 I was at the\r\nkirk. I\u2019m feart the din\u2019s gotten into my heid, an\u2019 I\u2019ll never get it\r\noot again. I cud maist wuss I was a mackerel, for they tell me the fish\r\nhears naething. I ken weel noo what ye meant, my lord, whan ye said ye\r\ndreidit the din micht gar ye forget yer Macker.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI hae been wussin\u2019 sair mysel\u2019, this last twa days,\u201D responded\r\nMalcolm, \u201C\u2019at I cud get ae sicht o\u2019 the jaws clashin\u2019 upo\u2019 the\r\nScaurnose, or rowin\u2019 up upo\u2019 the edge o\u2019 the links. The din o\u2019 natur\u2019\r\nnever troubles the guid thouchts in ye. I reckon it\u2019s \u2019cause it\u2019s a\r\nkin\u2019 o\u2019 a harmony in \u2019tsel\u2019, an\u2019 a harmony\u2019s jist, as the maister used\r\nto say, a higher kin\u2019 o\u2019 a peace. Yon organ \u2019at we hearkent till ae day\r\nootside the kirk, ye min\u2019--man, it was a quaietness in \u2019tsel\u2019, and cam\r\nthrou\u2019 the din like a bonny silence--like a lull i\u2019 the win\u2019 o\u2019 this\r\nwarl\u2019! It wasna a din at a\u2019, but a gran\u2019 repose like. But this noise\r\ntumultuous o\u2019 human strife, this din\u2019 o\u2019 iron shune an\u2019 iron wheels,\r\nthis whurr and whuzz o\u2019 buyin\u2019 an\u2019 sellin\u2019 an\u2019 gettin\u2019 gain--it disna\r\nhelp a body to their prayers.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEh, na, my lord! Jist think o\u2019 the preevilege--I never saw nor thoucht\r\no\u2019 \u2019t afore--o\u2019 haein\u2019 \u2019t i\u2019 yer pooer, ony nicht \u2019at ye\u2019re no efter\r\nthe fish, to stap oot at yer ain door, an\u2019 be in the mids o\u2019 the\r\ntemple! Be \u2019t licht or dark, be \u2019t foul or fair, the sea sleepin\u2019 or\r\nragin\u2019, ye ha\u2019e aye room, an\u2019 naething atween ye an\u2019 the throne o\u2019 the\r\nAlmichty, to the whilk yer prayers ken the gait, as weel \u2019s the herrin\u2019\r\nto the shores o\u2019 Scotlan\u2019: ye ha\u2019e but to lat them flee, an\u2019 they gang\r\nstraucht there. But here ye ha\u2019e aye to luik sae gleg efter yer boady,\r\n\u2019at, as ye say, my lord, yer sowl\u2019s like to come aff the waur, gien it\r\nbinna clean forgotten.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI doobt there\u2019s something no richt aboot it, Peter,\u201D returned Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere maun be a heap no richt aboot it,\u201D answered Peter.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, but I\u2019m no meanin\u2019 \u2019t jist as ye du. I had the haill thing throu\u2019\r\nmy heid last nicht, an\u2019 I canna but think there\u2019s something wrang\r\nwi\u2019 a man gien he canna hear the word o\u2019 God as weel i\u2019 the mids o\u2019\r\na multitude no man can number, a\u2019 made ilk ane i\u2019 the image o\u2019 the\r\nFather--as weel, I say, as i\u2019 the hert o\u2019 win\u2019 an\u2019 watter an\u2019 the lift\r\nan\u2019 the starns an\u2019 a\u2019. Ye canna say \u2019at thae things are a\u2019 made i\u2019 the\r\nimage o\u2019 God, in the same w\u2019y, at least, \u2019at ye can say \u2019t o\u2019 the body\r\nan\u2019 face o\u2019 a man, for throu\u2019 them the God o\u2019 the whole earth revealed\r\nHimsel\u2019 in Christ.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COw, weel, I wad alloo what ye say, gien they war a\u2019 to be considered\r\nChristi-ans.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COw, I grant we canna weel du that i\u2019 the full sense, but I doobt, gien\r\nthey bena a\u2019 Christi-ans \u2019at ca\u2019s themsels that, there\u2019s a heap mair\r\nChristi-anity nor gets the credit o\u2019 its ain name. I min\u2019 weel hoo\r\nMaister Graham said to me ance \u2019at hoo there was something o\u2019 Him \u2019at\r\nmade him, luikin\u2019 oot o\u2019 the een o\u2019 ilka man \u2019at he had made; an\u2019 what\r\nwad ye ca\u2019 that but a scart or a straik o\u2019 Christi-anity.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, I kenna; but ony gait I canna think it can be again\u2019 the trowth\r\no\u2019 the gospel to wuss yersel\u2019 mair alane wi\u2019 yer God nor ye ever can be\r\nin sic an awfu\u2019 Babylon o\u2019 a place as this.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNa, na, Peter; I\u2019m no sayin\u2019 that. I ken weel we\u2019re to gang intill the\r\ncloset and shut to the door. I\u2019m only afeart \u2019at there be something\r\nwrang in mysel\u2019 \u2019at taks \u2019t ill to be amon\u2019 sae mony neibors. I\u2019m\r\nthinkin\u2019 \u2019at, gien a\u2019 was richt \u2019ithin me, gien I lo\u2019ed my neibor\r\nas the Lord wad hae them \u2019at lo\u2019ed Him lo\u2019e ilk ane his brither, I\r\nmicht be better able to pray amang them--ay, i\u2019 the verra face o\u2019 the\r\nbargainin\u2019 an\u2019 leein\u2019 a\u2019 aboot me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAn\u2019 min\u2019 ye,\u201D said Peter, pursuing the train of his own thoughts, and\r\nheedless of Malcolm\u2019s, \u201C\u2019at oor Lord himsel\u2019 bude whiles to win awa\u2019,\r\neven frae his dissiples, to be him-lane wi\u2019 the Father o\u2019 \u2019im.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, ye\u2019re richt there, Peter,\u201D answered Malcolm, \u201Cbut there\u2019s ae\r\np\u2019int in \u2019t ye maunna forget--and that is \u2019at it was never i\u2019 the\r\nday-time--sae far \u2019s I min\u2019--\u2019at he did sae. The lee-lang day he was\r\namong \u2019s fowk--workin\u2019 his michty wark. Whan the nicht cam, in which no\r\nman could wark, he gaed hame till \u2019s Father, as \u2019t war. Eh me! but it\u2019s\r\nweel to ha\u2019e a man like the schuilmaister to put trowth intill ye. I\r\nkenna what comes o\u2019 them \u2019at ha\u2019e drucken maisters, or sic as cares for\r\nnaething but coontin\u2019 an Laitin, an\u2019 the likes o\u2019 that!\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nFLORIMEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night Florimel had her thoughts as well as Malcolm. Already life\r\nwas not what it had been to her, and the feeling of a difference is\r\noften what sets one a-thinking first. While her father lived, and the\r\nsureness of his love over-arched her consciousness with a heaven of\r\nsafety, the physical harmony of her nature had supplied her with a more\r\nthan sufficient sense of well-being. Since his death, too, there had\r\nbeen times when she even fancied an enlargement of life in the sense of\r\nfreedom and power which came with the knowledge of being a great lady,\r\npossessed of the rare privilege of an ancient title and an inheritance\r\nwhich seemed to her a yet greater wealth than it was. But she had soon\r\nfound that, as to freedom, she had less of that than before--less of\r\nthe feeling of it within her: not much freedom of any sort is to be\r\nhad without fighting for it, and she had yet to discover that the only\r\nfreedom worth the name --that of heart, and soul, and mind--is not to\r\nbe gained except through the hardest of battles. She was very lonely,\r\ntoo. Lady Bellair had never assumed with her any authority, and had\r\nalways been kind even to petting, but there was nothing about her to\r\nmake a home for the girl\u2019s heart. She felt in her no superiority, and\r\nfor a spiritual home that is essential. As she learned to know her\r\nbetter, this sense of loneliness went on deepening, for she felt more\r\nand more that her guardian was not one in whom she could place genuine\r\nconfidence, while yet her power over her was greater than she knew. The\r\ninnocent nature of the girl had begun to recoil from what she saw in\r\nthe woman of the world, and yet she had in herself worldliness enough\r\nto render her fully susceptible of her influences. Notwithstanding her\r\nfine health and natural spirits, Florimel had begun to know what it\r\nis to wake suddenly of a morning between three and four, and lie for\r\na long weary time, sleepless. In youth bodily fatigue ensures falling\r\nasleep, but as soon as the body is tolerably rested, if there be unrest\r\nin the mind, that wakes it, and consciousness returns in the shape of\r\na dull misgiving like the far echo of the approaching trump of the\r\narch-angel. Indeed, those hours are as a vestibule to the great hall\r\nof judgment, and to such as, without rendering it absolute obedience,\r\nyet care to keep on some sort of terms with their conscience, is\r\na time of anything but comfort. Nor does the court in those hours\r\nsitting, concern itself only with heavy questions of right or wrong,\r\nbut whoever loves and cares himself for his appearance before the eyes\r\nof men, finds himself accused of paltry follies, stupidities, and\r\nindiscretions, and punished with paltry mortifications, chagrins, and\r\nanxieties. From such arraignment no man is free but him who walks in\r\nthe perfect law of liberty--that is, the will of the Perfect--which\r\nalone is peace.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after she had thus taken Malcolm again into her service,\r\nFlorimel had one of these experiences--a foretaste of the Valley of\r\nthe Shadow: she awoke in the hour when judgment sits upon the hearts\r\nof men. Or is it not rather the hour for which a legion of gracious\r\nspirits are on the watch--when, fresh raised from the death of sleep,\r\ncleansed a little from the past and its evils by the gift of God, the\r\nheart and brain are most capable of their influences?--the hour when,\r\nbesides, there is no refuge of external things wherein the man may\r\nshelter himself from the truths they would so gladly send conquering\r\ninto the citadel of his nature, --no world of the senses to rampart\r\nthe soul from thought, when the eye and the ear are as if they were\r\nnot, and the soul lies naked before the infinite of reality. This live\r\nhour of the morning is the most real hour of the day, the hour of the\r\nmotions of a prisoned and persecuted life, of its effort to break\r\nthrough and breathe. A good man then finds his refuge in the heart of\r\nthe Purifying Fire; the bad man curses the swarms of Beelzebub that\r\nsettle upon every sore spot in his conscious being.\r\n\r\nBut it was not the general sense of unfitness in the conditions of her\r\nlife, neither was it dissatisfaction with Lady Bellair, or the want of\r\nthe pressure of authority upon her unstable being; it was not the sense\r\nof loneliness and unshelteredness in the sterile waste of fashionable\r\nlife, neither was it weariness with the same and its shows, or all\r\nthese things together, that could have waked the youth of Florimel\r\nand kept it awake at this hour of the night --for night that hour is,\r\nhowever near the morning.\r\n\r\nSome few weeks agone, she had accompanied to the study of a certain\r\npainter, a friend who was then sitting to him for her portrait. The\r\nmoment she entered, the appearance of the man and his surroundings laid\r\nhold of her imagination. Although on the very verge of popularity,\r\nhe was young--not more than five and twenty. His face, far from what\r\nis called handsome, had a certain almost grandeur in it, owed mainly\r\nto the dominant forehead, and the regnant life in the eyes. To this\r\nthe rest of the countenance was submissive. The mouth was sweet yet\r\nstrong, seeming to derive its strength from the will that towered\r\nabove and overhung it, throned on the crags of those eyebrows. The\r\nnose was rather short, not unpleasantly so, and had mass enough.\r\nIn figure he was scarcely above the usual height, but well formed.\r\nTo a first glance even, the careless yet graceful freedom of his\r\nmovements was remarkable, while his address was manly, and altogether\r\ndevoid of self-recommendation. Confident modesty and unobtrusive ease\r\ndistinguished his demeanour. His father, Arnold Lenorme, descended from\r\nan old Norman family, had given him the Christian name of Raoul, which,\r\nalthough outlandish, tolerably fitted the surname, notwithstanding\r\nthe contiguous _l_\u2019s, objectionable to the fastidious ear of their\r\nowner. The earlier and more important part of his education, the\r\nbeginnings, namely, of everything he afterwards further followed,\r\nhis mother herself gave him, partly because she was both poor and\r\ncapable, and partly because she was more anxious than most mothers\r\nfor his best welfare. The poverty they had crept through, as those\r\nthat strive after better things always will, one way or another, with\r\nimmeasurable advantage, and before the time came when he must leave\r\nhome, her influence had armed him in adamant--a service which alas! few\r\nmothers seem capable of rendering the knights whom they send out into\r\nthe battle-field of the world. Most of them give their children the\r\nbest they have; but how shall a foolish woman ever be a wise mother?\r\nThe result in his case was, that reverence for her as the type of\r\nwomanhood, working along with a natural instinct for refinement, a keen\r\nfeeling of the incompatibility with art of anything in itself low or\r\nunclean, and a healthful and successful activity of mind, had rendered\r\nhim so far upright and honourable that he had never yet done that in\r\none mood which in another he had looked back upon with loathing. As\r\nyet he had withstood the temptations belonging to his youth and his\r\nprofession--in great measure also the temptations belonging to success;\r\nhe had not yet been tried with disappointment, or sorrow, or failure.\r\n\r\nAs to the environment in which Florimel found him, it was to her a\r\nregion of confused and broken colour and form--a kind of chaos out of\r\nwhich beauty was ever ready to start. Pictures stood on easels, leaned\r\nagainst chair-backs, glowed from the wall--each contributing to the\r\natmosphere of solved rainbow that seemed to fill the space. Lenorme\r\nwas seated--not at his easel, but at a grand piano, which stood away,\r\nhalf-hidden in a corner, as if it knew itself there on sufferance,\r\nwith pictures all about the legs of it. For they had walked straight\r\nin without giving his servant time to announce them. A bar of a song,\r\nin a fine tenor voice, broke as they opened the door; and the painter\r\ncame to meet them from the farther end of the study. He shook hands\r\nwith Florimel\u2019s friend, and turned with a bow to her. At the first\r\nglance the eyes of both fell. Raised the same instant, they encountered\r\neach other point blank, and then the eloquent blood had its turn at\r\nbetrayal. What the moment meant, Florimel did not understand; but it\r\nseemed as if Raoul and she had met somewhere long ago, were presumed\r\nnot to know it, but could not help remembering it, and agreeing to\r\nrecognise it as a fact. A strange pleasure filled her heart. While\r\nMrs Barnardiston sat, she flitted about the room like a butterfly,\r\nlooking at one thing after another, and asking now the most ignorant,\r\nnow the most penetrative question, disturbing not a little the work,\r\nbut sweetening the temper of the painter, as he went on with his study\r\nof the mask and helmet into which the Gorgon stare of the Unideal had\r\npetrified the face and head of his sitter. He found the situation\r\ntrying nevertheless. It was as if Cupid had been set by Jupiter to\r\ntake a portrait of Io in her stall, while evermore he heard his Psyche\r\nfluttering about among the peacocks in the yard. For the girl had\r\nbewitched him at first sight. He thought it was only as an artist,\r\nthough to be sure a certain throb, almost of pain, in the region of the\r\nheart, when first his eyes fell before hers, might have warned, and\r\nperhaps did in vain warn him otherwise. Sooner than usual he professed\r\nhimself content with the sitting, and then proceeded to show the ladies\r\nsome of his sketches and pictures. Florimel asked to see one standing\r\nas in disgrace with its front to the wall. He put it, half reluctantly,\r\non an easel, and said it was meant for the unveiling of Isis, as\r\npresented in a m\u04D3hrchen of Novalis, introduced in _Die Lehrlinge zu\r\nSais_, in which the goddess of Nature reveals to the eager and anxious\r\ngaze of the beholder the person of his Rosenbl\u00FCthchen, whom he had left\r\nbehind him when he set out to visit the temple of the divinity. But\r\non the great pedestal where should have sat the goddess there was no\r\ngracious form visible. That part of the picture was a blank. The youth\r\nstood below, gazing enraptured with parted lips and outstretched arms,\r\nas if he had already begun to suspect what had begun to dawn through\r\nthe slowly thinning veil--but to the eye of the beholder he gazed as\r\nyet only on vacancy, and the picture had not reached an attempt at\r\nself-explanation. Florimel asked why he had left it so long unfinished,\r\nfor the dust was thick on the back of the canvas.\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause I have never seen the face or figure,\u201D the painter answered,\r\n\u201Ceither in eye of mind or of body, that claimed the position.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, his eyes seemed to Florimel to lighten strangely, and as\r\nif by common consent they turned away, and looked at something else.\r\nPresently Mrs Barnardiston, who cared more for sound than form or\r\ncolour, because she could herself sing a little, began to glance over\r\nsome music on the piano, curious to find what the young man had been\r\nsinging, whereupon Lenorme said to Florimel hurriedly, and almost in a\r\nwhisper, with a sort of hesitating assurance,\r\n\r\n\u201CIf _you_ would give me a sitting or two--I know I am presumptuous, but\r\nif you would--I--I should send the picture to the Academy in a week.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will,\u201D replied Florimel, flushing like a wild poppy, and as she said\r\nit, she looked up in his face and smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt would have been selfish,\u201D she said to herself as they drove away,\r\n\u201Cto refuse him.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis first interview, and all the interviews that had followed, now\r\npassed through her mind as she lay awake in the darkness preceding the\r\ndawn, and she reviewed them not without self-reproach. But for some of\r\nmy readers it will be hard to believe that one of the feelings that\r\nnow tormented the girl was a sense of lowered dignity because of the\r\nrelation in which she stood to the painter--seeing there was little or\r\nno ground for moral compunction, and the feeling had its root merely\r\nin the fact that he was a painter-fellow, and she a marchioness. Her\r\nrank had already grown to seem to her so identified with herself\r\nthat she was hardly any longer capable of the analysis that should\r\nshow it distinct from her being. As to any _duty_ arising from her\r\nposition, she had never heard the word used except as representing\r\nsomething owing to, not owed by rank. Social standing in the eyes of\r\nthe super-excellent few of fashion was the Satan of unrighteousness\r\nworshipped around her. And the precepts of this worship fell upon soil\r\nprepared for it. For with all the simplicity of her nature, there\r\nwas in it an inborn sense of rank, of elevation in the order of the\r\nuniverse above most others of the children of men--of greater intrinsic\r\nworth therefore in herself. How could it be otherwise with the\r\noffspring of generations of pride and falsely conscious superiority?\r\nHence, as things were going now with the mere human part of her, some\r\ncommotion, if not earthquake indeed, was imminent. Nay the commotion\r\nhad already begun, as manifest in her sleeplessness and the thoughts\r\nthat occupied it.\r\n\r\nRightly to understand the sense of shame and degradation she had not\r\nunfrequently felt of late, we must remember that in the circle in\r\nwhich she moved she heard professions, arts, and trades alluded to\r\nwith the same unuttered, but the more strongly implied contempt --a\r\ncontempt indeed regarded as so much a matter of course, so thoroughly\r\nunderstood, so reasonable in its nature, so absolute in its degree,\r\nthat to utter it would have been bad taste from very superfluity.\r\nYet she never entered the painter\u2019s study but with trembling heart,\r\nuncertain foot, and fluttering breath, as of one stepping within the\r\ngates of an enchanted paradise, whose joy is too much for the material\r\nweight of humanity to ballast even to the steadying of the bodily step,\r\nand the outward calm of the bodily carriage. How far things had gone\r\nbetween them we shall be able to judge by-and-by; it will be enough at\r\npresent to add that it was this relation and the inward strife arising\r\nfrom it that had not only prematurely, but over rapidly ripened the\r\ngirl into the woman.\r\n\r\nThis my disclosure of her condition, however, has not yet uncovered\r\nthe sorest spot upon which the flies of Beelzebub settled in the\r\ndarkness of this torture hour of the human clock. Although still the\r\nsame lively, self-operative nature she had been in other circumstances,\r\nshe was so far from being insensible or indifferent to the opinions of\r\nothers, that she had not even strength enough to keep a foreign will\r\noff the beam of her choice: the will of another, in no way directly\r\nbrought to bear on hers, would yet weigh to her encouragement where\r\nher wish was doubtful, or to her restraint where impulse was strong;\r\nit would even move her towards a line of conduct whose anticipated\r\nresults were distasteful to her. Ever and anon her pride would rise\r\narmed against the consciousness of slavery, but its armour was too weak\r\neither for defence or for deliverance. She knew that the heart of Lady\r\nBellair, what of heart she had, was set upon her marriage with her\r\nnephew, Lord Liftore. Now she recoiled from the idea of marriage, and\r\ndismissed it into a future of indefinite removal; she had no special\r\ndesire to please Lady Bellair from the point of gratitude, for she\r\nwas perfectly aware that her relation to herself was far from being\r\nwithout advantage to that lady\u2019s position as well as means: a whisper\r\nor two that had reached her had been enough to enlighten her in that\r\ndirection; neither could she persuade herself that Lord Liftore was\r\nat all the sort of man she could become proud of as a husband; and\r\nyet she felt destined to be his wife. On the other hand she had no\r\ndislike to him: he was handsome, well-informed, capable--a gentleman,\r\nshe thought, of good regard in the circles in which they moved, and\r\none who would not in any manner disgrace her, although to be sure he\r\nwas her inferior in rank, and she would rather have married a duke.\r\nAt the same time, to confess all the truth, she was by no means\r\nindifferent to the advantages of having for a husband a man with money\r\nenough to restore the somewhat tarnished prestige of her own family to\r\nits pristine brilliancy. She had never said a word to encourage the\r\nscheming of Lady Bellair; neither, on the other hand, had she ever\r\nsaid a word to discourage her hopes, or give her ground for doubting\r\nthe acceptableness of her cherished project. Hence Lady Bellair had\r\nnaturally come to regard the two as almost affianced. But Florimel\u2019s\r\naversion to the idea of marriage, and her horror at the thought of\r\nthe slightest whisper of what was between her and Lenorme, increased\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThere were times too when she asked herself in anxious discomfort\r\nwhether she was not possibly a transgressor against a deeper and\r\nsimpler law than that of station--whether she was altogether maidenly\r\nin the encouragement she had given and was giving to the painter. It\r\nmust not be imagined that she had once visited him without a companion,\r\nthough that companion was indeed sometimes only her maid--her real\r\nobject being covered by the true pretext of sitting for her portrait,\r\nwhich Lady Bellair pleased herself with imagining would one day be\r\npresented to Lord Liftore. But she could not, upon such occasions of\r\nmorning judgment as this, fail to doubt sorely whether the visits she\r\npaid him, and the liberties which upon fortunate occasions she allowed\r\nhim, were such as could be justified on any ground other than that\r\nshe was prepared to give him all. All, however, she was by no means\r\nprepared to give him: that involved consequences far too terrible to be\r\ncontemplated even as possibilities.\r\n\r\nWith such causes for disquiet in her young heart and brain, it is not\r\nthen wonderful that she should sometimes be unable to slip across this\r\ntroubled region of the night in the boat of her dreams, but should\r\nsuffer shipwreck on the waking coast, and have to encounter the staring\r\nand questioning eyes of more than one importunate truth. Nor is it\r\nany wonder either that, to such an inexperienced and so troubled a\r\nheart, the assurance of one absolutely devoted friend should come with\r\nhealing and hope--even if that friend should be but a groom, altogether\r\nincapable of understanding her position, or perceiving the phantoms\r\nthat crowded about her, threatening to embody themselves in her ruin. A\r\nclumsy, ridiculous fellow, she said to herself, from whose person she\r\ncould never dissociate the smell of fish, who talked a horrible jargon\r\ncalled Scotch, and who could not be prevented from uttering unpalatable\r\ntruths at uncomfortable moments; yet whose thoughts were as chivalrous\r\nas his person was powerful, and whose countenance was pleasing if only\r\nfor the triumph of honesty therein: she actually felt stronger and\r\nsafer to know he was near, and at her beck and call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nPORTLOSSIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Crathie, seeing nothing more of Malcolm, believed himself at last\r\nwell rid of him; but it was days before his wrath ceased to flame,\r\nand then it went on smouldering. Nothing occurred to take him to the\r\nSeaton, and no business brought any of the fisher-people to his office\r\nduring that time. Hence he heard nothing of the mode of Malcolm\u2019s\r\ndeparture. When at length in the course of ordinary undulatory\r\npropagation the news reached him that Malcolm had taken the yacht with\r\nhim, he was enraged beyond measure at the impudence of the theft, as he\r\ncalled it, and ran to the Seaton in a fury. He had this consolation,\r\nhowever: the man who had accused him of dishonesty and hypocrisy had\r\nproved but a thief.\r\n\r\nHe found the boat-house indeed empty, and went storming from cottage\r\nto cottage, but came upon no one from whom his anger could draw\r\nnourishment, not to say gain satisfaction. At length he reached the\r\nPartan\u2019s, found him at home, and commenced, at hap-hazard, abusing him\r\nas an aider and abettor of the felony. But Meg Partan was at home also,\r\nas Mr Crathie soon learned to his cost; for, hearing him usurp her\r\nunique privilege of falling out upon her husband, she stole from the\r\nben end, and having stood for a moment silent in the doorway, listening\r\nfor comprehension, rushed out in a storm of tongue.\r\n\r\n\u201CAn\u2019 what for sudna my man,\u201D she cried, at full height of her\r\nscreeching voice, \u201Clay tu his han\u2019 wi\u2019 ither honest fowk to du for the\r\nboat what him \u2019at was weel kent for the captain o\u2019 her, sin\u2019 ever she\r\nwas a boat, wantit dune?

He\r\ncould ill manage the boat alone.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat put sic buff an\u2019 styte i\u2019 yer heid, sir?\u201D rejoined Meg; defiant\r\nof the hints her husband sought to convey to her. \u201CThere\u2019s mony ane wad\r\nhae been ready to gang, only wha sud gang but him \u2019at gaed wi\u2019 him an\u2019\r\n\u2019s lordship frae the first?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd who was that?\u201D asked Mr Crathie.\r\n\r\n\u201COw! wha but Blue Peter?\u201D answered Meg.\r\n\r\n\u201CHm!\u201D said the factor, in a tone that for almost the first time in her\r\nlife made the woman regret that she had spoken, and therewith he rose\r\nand left the cottage.\r\n\r\n\u201CEh, mither!\u201D cried Lizzy, in her turn appearing from the ben-end, with\r\nher child in her arms, \u201Cye hae wroucht ruin i\u2019 the earth! He\u2019ll hae\r\nPeter an\u2019 Annie an\u2019 a\u2019 oot o\u2019 hoose an\u2019 ha\u2019, come midsummer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI daur him till \u2019t!\u201D cried her mother, in the impotence and\r\nself-despite of a mortifying blunder; \u201CI\u2019ll raise the toon upon \u2019im.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat wad that du, mither?\u201D returned Lizzy, in distress about her\r\nfriends. \u201CIt wad but mak ill waur.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAn\u2019 wha are ye to oppen yer mou\u2019 sae wide to yer mither?\u201D burst forth\r\nMeg Partan, glad of an object upon which the chagrin that consumed her\r\nmight issue in flame. \u201CYe ha\u2019ena luikit to yer ain gait sae weel \u2019at ye\r\ncan thriep to set richt them \u2019at broucht ye forth.--Wha are ye, I say?\u201D\r\nshe repeated in rage.\r\n\r\n\u201CAne \u2019at folly\u2019s made wiser, maybe, mither,\u201D answered Lizzie sadly,\r\nand proceeded to take her shawl from behind the door: she would go to\r\nher friends at Scaurnose, and communicate her fears for their warning.\r\nBut her words smote the mother within the mother, and she turned and\r\nlooked at her daughter with more of the woman and less of the Partan\r\nin her rugged countenance than had been visible there since the first\r\nweek of her married life. She had been greatly injured by the gaining\r\nof too easy a conquest and resultant supremacy over her husband, whence\r\nshe had ever after revelled in a rule too absolute for good to any\r\nconcerned. As she was turning away, her daughter caught a glimpse of\r\nher softened eyes, and went out of the house with more comfort in her\r\nheart than she had felt ever since first she had given her conscience\r\ncause to speak daggers to her.\r\n\r\nThe factor kept raging to himself all the way home, flung himself\r\ntrembling on his horse, vouchsafing his anxious wife scarce any answer\r\nto her anxious enquiries, and galloped to Duff Harbour to Mr Soutar.\r\n\r\nI will not occupy my tale with their interview. Suffice it to say that\r\nthe lawyer succeeded at last in convincing the demented factor that it\r\nwould be but prudent to delay measures for the recovery of the yacht\r\nand the arrest and punishment of its abductors, until he knew what Lady\r\nLossie would say to the affair. She had always had a liking for the\r\nlad, Mr Soutar said, and he would not be in the least surprised to hear\r\nthat Malcolm had gone straight to her ladyship and put himself under\r\nher protection. No doubt by this time the cutter was at its owner\u2019s\r\ndisposal: it would be just like the fellow! He always went the nearest\r\nroad anywhere. And to prosecute him for a thief would in any case but\r\nbring down the ridicule of the whole coast upon the factor, and breed\r\nhim endless annoyance in the getting in of his rents--especially among\r\nthe fishermen. The result was that Mr Crathie went home--not indeed\r\na humbler or wiser man than he had gone, but a thwarted man, and\r\ntherefore the more dangerous in the channels left open to the outrush\r\nof his angry power.\r\n\r\nWhen Lizzy reached Scaurnose, her account of the factor\u2019s behaviour, to\r\nher surprise, did not take much effect upon Mrs Mair: a queer little\r\nsmile broke over her countenance, and vanished. An enforced gravity\r\nsucceeded, however, and she began to take counsel with Lizzy as to what\r\nthey could do, or where they could go, should the worst come to the\r\nworst, and the doors, not only of her own house, but of Scaurnose and\r\nPortlossie as well, be shut against them. But through it all reigned\r\na calm regard and fearlessness of the future which, to Lizzy\u2019s roused\r\nand apprehensive imagination, was strangely inexplicable. Annie Mair\r\nseemed possessed of some hidden and upholding assurance that raised her\r\nabove the fear of man or what he could do to her. The girl concluded\r\nit must be the knowledge of God, and prayed more earnestly that night\r\nthan she had prayed since the night on which Malcolm had talked to\r\nher so earnestly before he left. I must add this much, that she was\r\nnot altogether astray: God was in Malcolm, giving new hope to his\r\nfisher-folk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nST JAMES THE APOSTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Malcolm left his sister, he had a dim sense of having lapsed into\r\nScotch, and set about buttressing and strengthening his determination\r\nto get rid of all unconscious and unintended use of the northern\r\ndialect, not only that, in his attendance upon Florimel, he might be\r\nneither offensive nor ridiculous, but that, when the time should come\r\nin which he must appear what he was, it might be less of an annoyance\r\nto her to yield the marquisate to one who could speak like a gentleman\r\nand one of the family. But not the less did he love the tongue he\r\nhad spoken from his childhood, and in which were on record so many\r\nprecious ballads and songs, old and new; and he resolved that, when he\r\ncame out as a marquis, he would at Lossie House indemnify himself for\r\nthe constraint of London. He would not have an English servant there\r\nexcept Mrs Courthope: he would not have the natural country speech\r\ncorrupted with cockneyisms, and his people taught to speak like Wallis!\r\nTo his old friends the fishers and their families, he would never\r\nutter a sentence but in the old tongue, haunted with all the memories\r\nof relations that were never to be obliterated or forgotten, its very\r\ntones reminding him and them of hardships together endured, pleasures\r\nshared, and help willingly given. At night, notwithstanding, he found\r\nthat in talking with Blue Peter, he had forgotten all about his\r\nresolve, and it vexed him with himself not a little. He now saw that if\r\nhe could but get into the way of speaking English to _him_, the victory\r\nwould be gained, for with no one else would he find any difficulty then.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he went down to the stairs at London Bridge, and took\r\na boat to the yacht. He had to cross several vessels to reach it. When\r\nat length he looked down from the last of them on the deck of the\r\nlittle cutter, he saw Blue Peter sitting on the coamings of the hatch,\r\nhis feet hanging down within. He was lost in the book he was reading.\r\nCurious to see, without disturbing him, what it was that so absorbed\r\nhim, Malcolm dropped quietly on the tiller, and thence on the deck,\r\nand approaching softly peeped over his shoulder. He was reading the\r\nepistle of James the apostle. Malcolm fell a-thinking. From Peter\u2019s\r\nthumbed Bible his eyes went wandering through the thicket of masts, in\r\nwhich moved so many busy seafarers, and then turned to the docks and\r\nwharfs and huge warehouses lining the shores; and while they scanned\r\nthe marvellous vision, the thoughts that arose and passed through his\r\nbrain were like these: \u201CWhat are ye duin\u2019 here, Jeames the Just? Ye was\r\nnaething but a fisher-body upon a sma\u2019 watter i\u2019 the hert o\u2019 the hills,\r\n\u2019at wasna even saut; an\u2019 what can the thochts that gaed throu\u2019 your\r\nfish-catchin\u2019 brain hae to du wi\u2019 sic a sicht \u2019s this? I won\u2019er gien\r\nat this moment there be anither man in a\u2019 Lon\u2019on sittin\u2019 readin\u2019 that\r\nepis-tle o\u2019 yours but Blue Peter here? _He_ thinks there\u2019s naething\r\no\u2019 mair importance, \u2019cep\u2019 maybe some ither pairts o\u2019 the same buik;\r\nbut syne he\u2019s but a puir fisher-body himsel\u2019, an\u2019 what kens he o\u2019\r\nthe wisdom an\u2019 riches an\u2019 pooer o\u2019 this michty queen o\u2019 the nations,\r\nthron\u2019t aboot him?--Is \u2019t possible the auld body kent something \u2019at\r\nwas jist as necessar\u2019 to ilka man, the busiest in this croodit mairt,\r\nto ken an\u2019 gang by, as it was to Jeames an\u2019 the lave o\u2019 the michty\r\napostles themsels? For me, I dinna doobt it--but hoo it sud ever be\r\nonything but an auld-warld story to the new warld o\u2019 Lon\u2019on, I think it\r\nwad bleck Maister Graham himsel\u2019 til imaigine.\u201D\r\n\r\nBefore this, Blue Peter had become aware that some one was near him,\r\nbut, intent on the words of his brother fisher of the old time, had\r\nhalf-unconsciously put off looking up to see who was behind him. When\r\nnow he did so, and saw Malcolm, he rose and touched his bonnet.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was jist i\u2019 my heid, my lord,\u201D he said, without any preamble, \u201Csic\r\na kin\u2019 o\u2019 a h\u2019avenly Jacobin as this same Jacobus was! He\u2019s sic a\r\nleveller as was feow afore \u2019im, I doobt, wi\u2019 his gowd-ringt man, an\u2019\r\nhis cloot-cled brither! He pat me in twa min\u2019s, my lord, whan I got up,\r\nwhether I wad touch my bonnet to yer lordship or no.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm laughed with hearty appreciation.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen I am king of Lossie,\u201D he said, \u201Cbe it known to all whom it may\r\nconcern, that it is and shall be the right of Blue Peter, and all his\r\ndescendants, to the end of time, to stand with bonneted heads in the\r\npresence of Lord or--no, not Lady, Peter--of the house of Lossie.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, but ye see, Ma\u2019colm,\u201D said Peter, forgetting his address, and his\r\neye twinkling in the humour of the moment, \u201Cit\u2019s no by your leave, or\r\nony man\u2019s leave; it\u2019s the richt o\u2019 the thing; an\u2019 that I maun think\r\naboot, an\u2019 see whether I be at leeberty to ca\u2019 ye _my lord_ or no.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMeantime, don\u2019t do it,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Clest you should have to change\r\nafterwards. You might find it difficult.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYe\u2019re cheengt a\u2019ready,\u201D said Blue Peter, looking up at him sharply. \u201CI\r\nne\u2019er h\u2019ard ye speyk like that afore.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMake nothing of it,\u201D returned Malcolm. \u201CI am only airing my English\r\non you; I have made up my mind to learn to speak in London as London\r\npeople do, and so, even to you, in the meantime only, I am going to\r\nspeak as good English as I can.--It\u2019s nothing between you and me, Peter\r\nand you must not mind it,\u201D he added, seeing a slight cloud come over\r\nthe fisherman\u2019s face.\r\n\r\nBlue Peter turned away with a sigh. The sounds of English speech from\r\nthe lips of Malcolm addressed to himself, seemed vaguely to indicate\r\nthe opening of a gulf between them, destined ere long to widen to the\r\nwhole social width between a fisherman and a marquis, swallowing up in\r\nit not only all old memories, but all later friendship and confidence.\r\nA shadow of bitterness crossed the poor fellow\u2019s mind, and in it the\r\nseed of distrust began to strike root, and all because a newer had been\r\nsubstituted for an older form of the same speech and language. Truly\r\nman\u2019s heart is a delicate piece of work, and takes gentle handling or\r\nhurt. But that the pain was not all of innocence is revealed in the\r\nstrange fact, afterwards disclosed by the repentant Peter himself,\r\nthat, in that same moment, what had just passed his mouth as a joke,\r\nput on an important, serious look, and appeared to involve a matter\r\nof doubtful duty: was it really right of one man to say _my lord_ to\r\nanother? Thus the fisherman, and not the marquis, was the first to sin\r\nagainst the other because of altered fortune. Distrust awoke pride in\r\nthe heart of Blue Peter, and he erred in the lack of the charity that\r\nthinketh no evil.\r\n\r\nBut the lack and the doubt made little show as yet. The two men rowed\r\nin the dinghy down the river to the Aberdeen wharf to make arrangements\r\nabout Kelpie, whose arrival Malcolm expected the following Monday, then\r\ndined together, and after that had a long row up the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nA DIFFERENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his keenness of judgment and sobriety in action,\r\nMalcolm had yet a certain love for effect, a delight, that is, in the\r\nshow of concentrated results, which, as I believe I have elsewhere\r\nremarked, belongs especially to the Celtic nature, and is one form\r\nin which the poetic element vaguely embodies itself. Hence arose the\r\ntemptation to try on Blue Peter the effect of a literally theatrical\r\nsurprise. He knew well the prejudices of the greater portion of the\r\nScots people against every possible form of artistic, most of all,\r\ndramatic representation. He knew, therefore, also, that Peter would\r\nnever be persuaded to go with him to the theatre: to invite him would\r\nbe like asking him to call upon Beelzebub; but as this feeling was\r\ncherished in utter ignorance of its object, he judged he would be doing\r\nhim no wrong if he made experiment how the thing itself would affect\r\nthe heart and judgment of the unsophisticated fisherman.\r\n\r\nFinding that _The Tempest_ was still the play represented, he\r\ncontrived, as they walked together, so to direct their course that they\r\nshould be near Drury Lane towards the hour of commencement. He did not\r\nwant to take him in much before the time: he would not give him scope\r\nfor thought, doubt, suspicion, discovery.\r\n\r\nWhen they came in front of the theatre, people were crowding in, and\r\ncarriages setting down their occupants. Blue Peter gave a glance at the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis\u2019ll be ane o\u2019 the Lon\u2019on kirks, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019?\u201D he said. \u201CIt\u2019s\r\na muckle place; an\u2019 there maun be a heap o\u2019 guid fowk in Lon\u2019on,\r\nfor as ill \u2019s it\u2019s ca\u2019d, to see sae mony, an\u2019 i\u2019 their cairritches,\r\ncomin\u2019 to the kirk--on a Setterday nicht tu. It maun be some kin\u2019 o\u2019 a\r\nprayer-meetin\u2019, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm said nothing, but led the way to the pit entrance.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s no an ill w\u2019y o\u2019 getherin\u2019 the baubees,\u201D said Peter, seeing how\r\nthe in-comers paid their money. \u201CI hae h\u2019ard o\u2019 the plate bein\u2019 robbit\r\nin a muckle toon afore noo.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen at length they were seated, and he had time to glance reverently\r\naround him, he was a little staggered at sight of the decorations;\r\nand the thought crossed his mind of the pictures and statues he had\r\nheard of in catholic churches; but he remembered Westminster Abbey,\r\nits windows and monuments, and returned to his belief that he was, if\r\nin an episcopal, yet in a protestant church. But he could not help the\r\nthought that the galleries were a little too gaudily painted, while\r\nthe high pews in them astonished him. Peter\u2019s nature, however, was one\r\nof those calm, slow ones which, when occupied by an idea or a belief,\r\nare by no means ready to doubt its correctness, and are even ingenious\r\nin reducing all apparent contradictions to theoretic harmony with\r\nit--whence it came that to him all this was only part of the church\r\nfurniture according to the taste and magnificence of London. He sat\r\nquite tranquil, therefore, until the curtain rose, revealing the ship\u2019s\r\ncompany in all the confusion of the wildest of sea storms.\r\n\r\nMalcolm watched him narrowly. But Peter was first so taken by surprise,\r\nand then so carried away with the interest of what he saw, that\r\nthinking had ceased in him utterly, and imagination lay passive as a\r\nmirror to the representation. Nor did the sudden change from the first\r\nto the second scene rouse him, for before his thinking machinery could\r\nbe set in motion, the delight of the new show had again caught him in\r\nits meshes. For to him, as it had been to Malcolm, it was the shore at\r\nPortlossie, while the cave that opened behind was the Bailie\u2019s Barn,\r\nwhere his friends the fishers might at that moment, if it were a fine\r\nnight, be holding one of their prayer meetings. The mood lasted all\r\nthrough the talk of Prospero and Miranda; but when Ariel entered there\r\ncame a snap, and the spell was broken. With a look in which doubt\r\nwrestled with horror, Blue Peter turned to Malcolm, and whispered with\r\nbated breath--\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m jaloosin\u2019--it canna be--it\u2019s no a playhoose, this?\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm merely nodded, but from the nod Peter understood that _he_ had\r\nhad no discovery to make as to the character of the place they were in.\r\n\r\n\u201CEh!\u201D he groaned, overcome with dismay. Then rising suddenly-- \u201CGuid\r\nnicht to ye, my lord,\u201D he said, with indignation, and rudely forced his\r\nway from the crowded house.\r\n\r\nMalcolm followed in his wake, but said nothing till they were in the\r\nstreet. Then, forgetting utterly his resolves concerning English in the\r\ndistress of having given his friend ground to complain of his conduct\r\ntowards him, he laid his hand on Blue Peter\u2019s arm, and stopped him in\r\nthe middle of the narrow street.\r\n\r\n\u201CI but thoucht, Peter,\u201D he said, \u201Cto get ye to see wi\u2019 yer ain een, an\u2019\r\nhear wi\u2019 yer ain ears, afore ye passed jeedgment; but ye\u2019re jist like\r\nthe lave.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAn\u2019 what for sudna I be jist like the lave?\u201D returned Peter, fiercely.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Cause it\u2019s no fair to set doon a thing for wrang \u2019at ye ha\u2019e been\r\ni\u2019 the w\u2019y o\u2019 hearing aboot by them \u2019at kens as little aboot them as\r\nyersel\u2019. I cam here mysel\u2019, ohn kent whaur I was gaein\u2019, the ither\r\nnicht, for the first time i\u2019 my life; but I wasna fleyt like you,\r\n\u2019cause I kent frae the buik a\u2019 \u2019at was comin\u2019. I ha\u2019e h\u2019ard in a kirk\r\nin ae ten meenutes jist a sicht o\u2019 what maun ha\u2019e been sair displeasin\u2019\r\nto the hert a\u2019 the maister o\u2019 \u2019s a\u2019; but that nicht I saw nae ill an\u2019\r\nh\u2019ard nae ill, but was weel peyed back upo\u2019 them \u2019at did it an\u2019 said\r\nit afore the business was ower, an\u2019 that\u2019s mair nor ye\u2019ll see i\u2019 the\r\nstreets o\u2019 Portlossie ilka day. The play-hoose is whaur ye gang to see\r\nwhat comes o\u2019 things \u2019at ye canna follow oot in ordinar\u2019 life.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhether Malcolm, after a year\u2019s theatre-going, would have said\r\nprecisely the same is hardly doubtful. He spoke of the ideal theatre to\r\nwhich Shakspere is true, and in regard to that he spoke rightly.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe decoy\u2019t me intill the hoose o\u2019 ineequity!\u201D was Peter\u2019s indignant\r\nreply; \u201Can\u2019 it\u2019s no what ye ever ga\u2019e me cause to expec\u2019 o\u2019 ye, sae \u2019at\r\nI micht ha\u2019e ta\u2019en tent o\u2019 ye.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI thoucht nae ill o\u2019 \u2019t,\u201D returned Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, _I div_,\u201D retorted Peter.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen perhaps you are wrong,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cfor charity thinketh no\r\nevil. You wouldn\u2019t stay to see the thing out.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere ye are at yer English again! an\u2019 misgugglin\u2019 Scriptur\u2019 wi\u2019 \u2019t,\r\nan\u2019 a\u2019 this upo\u2019 Setterday nicht--maist the Sawbath day!

But maybe it\u2019s the markis o\u2019 \u2019im, an\u2019 no the muckle toon\r\n\u2019at\u2019s made the differ. Ony gait, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 it\u2019ll be aboot time for\r\nme to be gauin\u2019 hame.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm was vexed with himself, and both disappointed and troubled at\r\nthe change which had come over his friend, and threatened to destroy\r\nthe life-long relation between them; his feelings therefore held him\r\nsilent. Peter concluded that _the marquis_ was displeased, and it\r\nclenched his resolve to go.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat w\u2019y am I to win hame, my lord?\u201D he said, when they had walked\r\nsome distance without word spoken.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy the Aberdeen smack,\u201D returned Malcolm. \u201CShe sails on Tuesday.\r\nI will see you on board. You must take young Davy with you, for I\r\nwouldn\u2019t have him here after you are gone. There will be nothing for\r\nhim to do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYe\u2019re unco ready to pairt wi\u2019 \u2019s noo \u2019at ye ha\u2019e nae mair use for \u2019s,\u201D\r\nsaid Peter.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo sae ready as ye seem to pairt wi\u2019 yer chairity,\u201D said Malcolm, now\r\nangry too.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe see Annie \u2019ill be thinkin\u2019 lang,\u201D said Peter, softening a little.\r\n\r\nNo more angry words passed between them, but neither did any thoroughly\r\ncordial ones, and they parted at the stairs in mutual, though, with\r\nsuch men, it could not be more than superficial estrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nLORD LIFTORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of Malcolm\u2019s anxiety had been, and perhaps still was,\r\nLord Liftore. In his ignorance of Mr Lenorme there might lie equal\r\ncause with him, but he knew such evil of the other that his whole\r\nnature revolted against the thought of his marrying his sister. At\r\nLossie he had made himself agreeable to her, and now, if not actually\r\nliving in the same house, he was there at all hours of the day.\r\n\r\nIt took nothing from his anxiety to see that his lordship was greatly\r\nimproved. Not only had the lanky youth passed into a well-formed\r\nman, but in countenance, whether as regarded expression, complexion,\r\nor feature, he was not merely a handsomer but looked in every way a\r\nhealthier and better man. Whether it was from some reviving sense of\r\nduty, or that, in his attachment to Florimel, he had begun to cherish a\r\ndesire of being worthy of her, I cannot tell; but he looked altogether\r\nmore of a man than the time that had elapsed would have given ground\r\nto expect, even had he then seemed on the mend, and indeed promised to\r\nbecome a really fine-looking fellow. His features were far more regular\r\nif less _informed_ than those of the painter, and his carriage prouder\r\nif less graceful and energetic. His admiration of and consequent\r\nattachment to Florimel had been growing ever since his visit to Lossie\r\nHouse the preceding summer, and if he had said nothing quite definite,\r\nit was only because his aunt represented the impolicy of declaring\r\nhimself just yet: she was too young. She judged thus, attributing her\r\nevident indifference to an incapacity as yet for falling in love.\r\nHence, beyond paying her all sorts of attentions and what compliments\r\nhe was capable of constructing, Lord Liftore had not gone far towards\r\nmaking himself understood--at least, not until just before Malcolm\u2019s\r\narrival, when his behaviour had certainly grown warmer and more\r\nconfidential.\r\n\r\nAll the time she had been under his aunt\u2019s care he had had abundant\r\nopportunity for recommending himself, and he had made use of the\r\nprivilege. For one thing, credibly assured that he looked well in the\r\nsaddle, he had constantly encouraged Florimel\u2019s love of riding and\r\ndesire to become a thorough horsewoman, and they had ridden a good\r\ndeal together in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. This practice they\r\ncontinued as much as possible after they came to London early in the\r\nspring; but the weather of late had not been favourable, and Florimel\r\nhad been very little out with him.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Lady Bellair had had her mind set on a match between\r\nthe daughter of her old friend the Marquis of Lossie and her nephew,\r\nand it was with this in view that, when invited to Lossie House, she\r\nhad begged leave to bring Lord Meikleham with her. The young man was\r\nfrom the first sufficiently taken with the beautiful girl to satisfy\r\nhis aunt, and would even then have shown greater fervour in _his_\r\nattentions, had he not met Lizzy Findlay at the wedding of Joseph\r\nMair\u2019s sister, and found her more than pleasing. I will not say that\r\nfrom the first he purposed wrong to her: he was too inexperienced in\r\nthe ways of evil for that; but even when he saw plainly enough to\r\nwhat their mutual attraction was tending, he gave himself no trouble\r\nto resist it; and through the whole unhappy affair had not had one\r\nsmallest struggle with himself for the girl\u2019s sake. To himself he was\r\nall in all as yet, and such was his opinion of his own precious being,\r\nthat, had he thought about it, he would have considered the honour of\r\nhis attentions far more than sufficient to make up to any girl in such\r\na position for whatever mishap his acquaintance might bring upon her.\r\nWhat were the grief and mortification of parents to put in the balance\r\nagainst his condescension? what the shame and the humiliation of the\r\ngirl herself compared with the honour of having been shone upon for\r\na period, however brief, by his enamoured countenance? Must not even\r\nthe sorrow attendant upon her loss be rendered more than endurable--be\r\nradiantly consoled by the memory that she had held such a demigod in\r\nher arms? When he left her at last, with many promises, not one of\r\nwhich he ever had the intention of fulfilling, he did purpose sending\r\nher a present. But at that time he was poor--dependent, indeed, for\r\nhis pocket-money upon his aunt; and, up to this hour, he had never\r\nsince his departure from Lossie House taken the least notice of her\r\neither by gift or letter. He had taken care also that it should not\r\nbe in her power to write to him, and now he did not even know that he\r\nwas a father. Once or twice the possibility of such being the case\r\noccurred to him, and he thought within himself that if he were, and\r\nit should come to be talked of, it might, in respect of his present\r\nhopes, be awkward and disagreeable; for, although such a predicament\r\nwas nowise unusual, in this instance the circumstances were. More\r\nthan one of his bachelor friends had a small family even, but then it\r\nwas in the regular way of an open and understood secret: the fox had\r\nhis nest in some pleasant nook, adroitly masked, where lay his vixen\r\nand her brood; one day he would abandon them for ever, and, with such\r\ngathered store of experience, set up for a respectable family man. A\r\nfew tears, a neat legal arrangement, and all would be as it had never\r\nbeen, only that the blood of the Montmorencies or Cliffords would\r\nmeander unclaimed in this or that obscure channel, beautifying the\r\nrace, and rousing England to noble deeds! But in his case it would be\r\nunpleasant--a little--that every one of his future tenantry should\r\nknow the relation in which he stood to a woman of the fisher-people.\r\nHe did not fear any resentment--not that he would have cared a straw\r\nfor it, on such trifling grounds, but people in their low condition\r\nnever thought anything of such slips on the part of their women\r\nespecially where a great man was concerned. What he did fear was that\r\nthe immediate relations of the woman--that was how he spoke of Lizzy\r\nto himself --might presume upon the honour he had done them. Lizzy,\r\nhowever, was a good girl, and had promised to keep the matter secret\r\nuntil she heard from him, whatever might be the consequences; and\r\nsurely there was fascination enough in the holding of a secret with\r\nsuch as he to enable her to keep her promise. She must be perfectly\r\naware, however appearances might be against him, that he was not one to\r\nfail in appreciation of her conduct, however easy and natural all that\r\nhe required of her might be. He would requite her royally when he was\r\nLord of Lossie. Meantime, although it was even now in his power to make\r\nher rich amends, he would prudently leave things as they were, and not\r\nrun the risk that must lie in opening communications.\r\n\r\nAnd so the young earl held his head high, looked as innocent as may be\r\ndesirable for a gentleman, had many a fair clean hand laid in his, and\r\nmany a maiden waist yielded to his arm, while \u201Cthe woman\u201D flitted about\r\nhalf an alien amongst her own, with his child wound in her old shawl of\r\nLossie tartan; wandering not seldom in the gloaming when her little one\r\nslept, along the top of the dune, with the wind blowing keen upon her\r\nfrom the regions of eternal ice, sometimes the snow settling softly on\r\nher hair, sometimes the hailstones nestling in its meshes; the skies\r\ngrowing blacker about her, and the sea stormier, while hope retreated\r\nso far into the heavenly regions, that hope and heaven both were lost\r\nto her view. Thus, alas! the things in which he was superior to her,\r\nmost of all that he was a gentleman, while she was but a peasant girl--\r\nthe things whose witchery drew her to his will, he made the means\r\nof casting her down from the place of her excellency into the mire\r\nof shame and loss. The only love worthy of the name ever and always\r\nuplifts.\r\n\r\nOf the people belonging to the upper town of Portlossie, which raised\r\nitself high above the sea-town in other respects besides the topical,\r\nthere were none who did not make poor Lizzy feel they were aware of her\r\ndisgrace, and but one man who made her feel it by being kinder than\r\nbefore. That man, strange to say, was the factor. With all his faults\r\nhe had some chivalry, and he showed it to the fisher-girl. Nor did he\r\nalter his manner to her because of the rudeness with which her mother\r\nhad taken Malcolm\u2019s part.\r\n\r\nIt was a sore proof to Mr Crathie that his discharged servant was in\r\nfavour with the marchioness when the order came from Mr Soutar to send\r\nup Kelpie. She had written to himself when she wanted her own horse;\r\nnow she sent for this brute through her lawyer. It was plain that\r\nMalcolm had been speaking against him; and he was the more embittered\r\ntherefore against his friends.\r\n\r\nSince his departure he had been twice on the point of poisoning the\r\nmare.\r\n\r\nIt was with difficulty he found two men to take her to Aberdeen. There\r\nthey had an arduous job to get her on board and secure her. But it had\r\nbeen done, and all the Monday night Malcolm was waiting her arrival at\r\nthe wharf--alone, for after what had passed between them, he would not\r\nask Peter to go with him, and besides he was no use with horses. At\r\nlength, in the grey of a gurly dawn, the smack came alongside. They had\r\nhad a rough passage, and the mare was considerably subdued by sickness,\r\nso that there was less difficulty in getting her ashore, and she paced\r\nfor a little while in tolerable quietness. But with every step on dry\r\nland, the evil spirit in her awoke, and soon Malcolm had to dismount\r\nand lead her. The morning was little advanced, and few vehicles\r\nwere about, otherwise he could hardly have got her home uninjured,\r\nnotwithstanding the sugar with which he had filled a pocket. Before he\r\nreached the mews he was very near wishing he had never seen her. But\r\nwhen he led her into the stable, he was a little encouraged as well as\r\nsurprised to find that she had not forgotten Florimel\u2019s horse. They had\r\nalways been a little friendly, and now they greeted each other with an\r\naffectionate neigh; after which, with the help of all she could devour,\r\nthe demoness was quieter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nKELPIE IN LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore noon Lord Liftore came round to the mews: his riding horses were\r\nthere. Malcolm was not at the moment in the stable.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat animal is that?\u201D he asked of his own groom, catching sight of\r\nKelpie in her loose box.\r\n\r\n\u201COne just come up from Scotland for Lady Lossie, my lord,\u201D answered the\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe looks a clipper! Lead her out, and let me see her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s not sound in the temper, my lord, the groom that brought her\r\nsays. He told me on no account to go near her till she got used to the\r\nsight of me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh! you\u2019re afraid, are you?\u201D said his lordship, whose breeding had not\r\ntaught him courtesy to his inferiors.\r\n\r\nAt the word the man walked into her box. As he did so he looked out\r\nfor her hoofs, but his circumspection was in vain: in a moment she had\r\nwheeled, jammed him against the wall, and taken his shoulder in her\r\nteeth. He gave a yell of pain. His lordship caught up a stable-broom,\r\nand attacked the mare with it over the door; but it flew from his hand\r\nto the other end of the stable, and the partition began to go after it.\r\nBut she still kept her hold of the man. Happily, however, Malcolm was\r\nnot far off, and hearing the noise, rushed in. He was just in time to\r\nsave the groom\u2019s life. Clearing the stall-partition, and seizing the\r\nmare by the nose with a mighty grasp, he inserted a fore-finger behind\r\nher tusk, for she was one of the few mares tusked like a horse, and\r\nsoon compelled her to open her mouth. The groom staggered and would\r\nhave fallen, so cruelly had she mauled him, but Malcolm\u2019s voice roused\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor God\u2019s sake gang oot, as lang \u2019s there\u2019s twa limbs o\u2019 ye stickin\u2019\r\nthegither.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow just managed to open the door, and fell senseless on\r\nthe stones. Lord Liftore called for help, and they carried him into the\r\nsaddle room, while one ran for the nearest surgeon.\r\n\r\nMeantime Malcolm was putting a muzzle on Kelpie, which he believed\r\nshe understood as a punishment, and while he was thus occupied, his\r\nlordship came from the saddle-room and approached the box.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho are you?\u201D he said. \u201CI think I have seen you before.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI was servant to the late Marquis of Lossie, my lord, and now I am\r\ngroom to her ladyship.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a fury you\u2019ve brought up with you! She\u2019ll never do for London.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI told the man not to go near her, my lord.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the use of her if no one can go near her?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can, my lord.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBy Jove, she\u2019s a splendid creature to look at! but I don\u2019t know what\r\nyou can do with her here, my man. She\u2019s fit to go double with Satan\r\nhimself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019ll do for me to ride after my lady well enough. If only I had room\r\nto exercise her a bit!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTake her into the park early in the morning, and gallop her round.\r\nOnly mind she don\u2019t break your neck. What can have made Lady Lossie\r\nsend for such a devil as that!\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm held his peace.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll try her myself some morning,\u201D said his lordship, who thought\r\nhimself a better horseman than he was.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t advise you, my lord.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho the devil asked your advice?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTen to one she\u2019ll kill you, my lord.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s my look out,\u201D said Liftore, and went into the house.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had done with Kelpie, Malcolm dressed himself in his new\r\nlivery, and went to tell his mistress of her arrival. She sent him\r\norders to bring the mare round in half-an-hour. He went back to her,\r\ntook off her muzzle, fed her, and while she ate her corn, put on the\r\nspurs he had prepared expressly for her use--a spike without a rowel,\r\nrather blunt, but sharp indeed when sharply used --like those of the\r\nGauchos of the Pampas. Then he saddled her, and rode her round.\r\n\r\nHaving had her fit of temper, she was, to all appearance, going to be\r\nfairly good for the rest of the day, and looked splendid. She was a\r\nlarge mare, nearly thoroughbred, but with more bone than usual for her\r\nbreeding, which she carried triumphantly--an animal most men would have\r\nbeen pleased to possess--and proud to ride. Florimel came to the door\r\nto see her, accompanied by Liftore, and was so delighted with the very\r\nsight of her that she sent at once to the stables for her own horse,\r\nthat she might ride out attended by Malcolm. His lordship also ordered\r\nhis horse.\r\n\r\nThey went straight to Rotten Row for a little gallop, and Kelpie was\r\nbehaving very well for her.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat _did_ you have two such savages, horse and groom both, up from\r\nScotland for, Florimel?\u201D asked his lordship, as they cantered gently\r\nalong the Row, Kelpie coming sideways after them, as if she would fain\r\nalter the pairing of her legs.\r\n\r\nFlorimel turned and cast an admiring glance on the two.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know I am rather proud of them,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s a clumsy fellow, the groom; and for the mare, she\u2019s downright\r\nwicked,\u201D said Liftore.\r\n\r\n\u201CAt least neither is a hypocrite,\u201D returned Florimel, with Malcolm\u2019s\r\naccount of his quarrel with the factor in her mind. \u201CThe mare is just\r\nas wicked as she looks, and the man as good. Believe me, my lord, that\r\nman you call a savage never told a lie in his life!\u201D\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she looked him hard in the face--with her father in her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nLiftore could not return the look with equal steadiness. It seemed for\r\nthe moment to be inquiring too curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201CI know what you mean,\u201D he said. \u201CYou don\u2019t believe my professions.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he edged his horse close up to hers.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut,\u201D he went on, \u201Cif I know that I speak the truth when I swear that\r\nI love every breath of wind that has but touched your dress as it\r\npassed, that I would die gladly for one loving touch of your hand--why\r\nshould you not let me ease my heart by saying so? Florimel, my life has\r\nbeen a different thing from the moment I saw you first. It has grown\r\nprecious to me since I saw that it might be --Confound the fellow!\r\nwhat\u2019s he about now with his horse-devil?\u201D\r\n\r\nFor at that moment his lordship\u2019s horse, a high-bred but timid animal,\r\nsprang away from the side of Florimel\u2019s, and there stood Kelpie on\r\nher hind legs, pawing the air between him and his lady, and Florimel,\r\nwhose old confidence in Malcolm was now more than revived, was\r\nlaughing merrily at the discomfiture of his attempt at love-making.\r\nHer behaviour and his own frustration put him in such a rage that,\r\nwheeling quickly round, he struck Kelpie, just as she dropped on all\r\nfours, a great cut with his whip across the haunches. She plunged and\r\nkicked violently, came within an inch of breaking his horse\u2019s leg, and\r\nflew across the rail into the park. Nothing could have suited Malcolm\r\nbetter. He did not punish her as he would have done had she been to\r\nblame, for he was always just to lower as well as higher animals, but\r\nhe took her a great round at racing speed, while his mistress and\r\nher companion looked on, and everyone in the Row stopped and stared.\r\nFinally, he hopped her over the rail again, and brought her up dripping\r\nand foaming to his mistress. Florimel\u2019s eyes were flashing, and Liftore\r\nlooked still angry.\r\n\r\n\u201CDinna du that again, my lord,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CYe\u2019re no my maister; an\u2019\r\ngien ye war, ye wad hae no richt to brak my neck.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo fear of that! That\u2019s not how your neck will be broken, my man,\u201D\r\nsaid his lordship, with an attempted laugh; for though he was all the\r\nangrier that he was ashamed of what he had done, he dared not further\r\nwrong the servant before his mistress.\r\n\r\nA policeman came up and laid his hand on Kelpie\u2019s bridle.\r\n\r\n\u201CTake care what you\u2019re about,\u201D said Malcolm; \u201Cthe mare\u2019s not safe.\r\n--There\u2019s my mistress, the Marchioness of Lossie.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe man saw an ugly look in Kelpie\u2019s eye, withdrew his hand, and turned\r\nto Florimel.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy groom is not to blame,\u201D said she. \u201CLord Liftore struck his mare,\r\nand she became ungovernable.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe man gave a look at Liftore, seemed to take his likeness, touched\r\nhis hat, and withdrew.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019d better ride the jade home,\u201D said Liftore.\r\n\r\nMalcolm only looked at his mistress. She moved on, and he followed.\r\n\r\nHe was not so innocent in the affair as he had seemed. The expression\r\nof Liftore\u2019s face as he drew nearer to Florimel, was to him so hateful,\r\nthat he interfered in a very literal fashion: Kelpie had been doing no\r\nmore than he had made her until the earl struck her.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet us ride to Richmond to-morrow,\u201D said Florimel, \u201Cand have a good\r\ngallop in the park. Did you ever see a finer sight than that animal on\r\nthe grass?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe fellow\u2019s too heavy for her,\u201D said Liftore. \u201CI should very much\r\nlike to try her myself.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel pulled up, and turned to Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CMacPhail,\u201D she said, \u201Chave that mare of yours ready whenever Lord\r\nLiftore chooses to ride her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI beg your pardon, my lady,\u201D returned Malcolm, \u201Cbut would your\r\nladyship make a condition with my lord that he shall not mount her\r\nanywhere on the stones.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBy Jove!\u201D said Liftore scornfully. \u201CYou fancy yourself the only man\r\nthat can ride!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s nothing to me, my lord, if you break your neck; but I am bound to\r\ntell you I do _not_ think your lordship will sit my mare. Stoat can\u2019t;\r\nand I can only because I know her as well as my own palm.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe young earl made no answer and they rode on--Malcolm nearer than his\r\nlordship liked.\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t think, Florimel,\u201D he said, \u201Cwhy you should want that fellow\r\nabout you again. He is not only very awkward, but insolent as well.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI should call it straightforward,\u201D returned Florimel.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy dear Lady Lossie! See how close he is riding to us now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is anxious, I daresay, as to your Lordship\u2019s behaviour. He is like\r\nsome dogs that are a little too careful of their mistresses-- touchy\r\nas to how they are addressed--not a bad fault in dog--or groom either.\r\nHe saved my life once, and he was a great favourite with my father: I\r\nwon\u2019t hear anything against him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut for your own sake--just consider:--what will people say if you\r\nshow any preference for a man like that?\u201D said Liftore, who had already\r\nbecome jealous of the man who in his heart he feared could ride better\r\nthan himself.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lord!\u201D exclaimed Florimel, with a mingling of surprise and\r\nindignation in her voice, and suddenly quickening her pace, dropped him\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nMalcolm was after her so instantly, that it brought him abreast of\r\nLiftore.\r\n\r\n\u201CKeep your own place,\u201D said his lordship, with stern rebuke.\r\n\r\n\u201CI keep my place to my mistress,\u201D returned Malcolm.\r\n\r\nLiftore looked at him as if he would strike him. But he thought better\r\nof it apparently, and rode after Florimel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nBLUE PETER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time he had put up Kelpie, Malcolm found that his only chance\r\nof seeing Blue Peter before he left London, lay in going direct to the\r\nwharf. On his road he reflected on what had just passed, and was not\r\naltogether pleased with himself. He had nearly lost his temper with\r\nLiftore; and if he should act in any way unbefitting the position he\r\nhad assumed, from the duties of which he was in no degree exonerated\r\nby the fact that he had assumed it for a purpose, it would not only\r\nbe a failure in himself, but an impediment perhaps insurmountable in\r\nthe path of his service. To attract attention was almost to insure\r\nfrustration. When he reached the wharf he found they had nearly got her\r\nfreight on board the smack. Blue Peter stood on the forecastle. He went\r\nto him and explained how it was that he had been unable to join him\r\nsooner.\r\n\r\n\u201CI didna ken ye,\u201D said Blue Peter, \u201Cin sic playactor kin\u2019 o\u2019 claes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNobody in London would look at me twice now. But you remember how we\r\nwere stared at when first we came,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201COw ay!\u201D returned Peter with almost a groan; \u201Cthere\u2019s a sair cheenge\r\npast upo\u2019 you, but I\u2019m gauin\u2019 hame to the auld w\u2019y o\u2019 things. The\r\nherrin\u2019 \u2019ll be aye to the fore, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019; an\u2019 gien we getna a\r\nharbour we\u2019ll get a h\u2019aven.\u201D\r\n\r\nJudging it better to take no notice of this pretty strong expression of\r\ndistrust and disappointment, Malcolm led him aside, and putting a few\r\nsovereigns in his hand, said,\r\n\r\n\u201CHere, Peter, that will take you home.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s ower muckle--a heap ower muckle. I\u2019ll tak naething frae ye but\r\nwhat\u2019ll pay my w\u2019y.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what is such a trifle between friends?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere _was_ a time, Ma\u2019colm, whan what was mine was yours, an\u2019 what\r\nwas yours was mine, but that time\u2019s gane.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry to hear that, Peter; but still I owe you as much as that for\r\nbare wages.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere was no word o\u2019 wauges when ye said, Peter, come to Lon\u2019on wi\u2019\r\nme.--Davie there--he maun hae his wauges.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel,\u201D said Malcolm, thinking it better to give way, \u201CI\u2019m no abune\r\nbein\u2019 obleeged to ye, Peter. I maun bide my time, I see, for ye winna\r\nlippen till me. Eh man! your faith\u2019s sune at the wa\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFaith! what faith?\u201D returned Peter, almost fiercely. \u201CWe\u2019re tauld\r\nto put no faith in man; an\u2019 gien I bena come to that yet freely, I\u2019m\r\nnearer till \u2019t nor ever I was afore.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, Peter, a\u2019 \u2019at I can say is, I ken my ain hert, an\u2019 ye dinna ken\r\n\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDaur ye tell me!\u201D cried Peter. \u201CDisna the Scriptur\u2019 itsel\u2019 say the\r\nhert o\u2019 man is deceitfu\u2019 an\u2019 despratly wickit: who can know it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPeter,\u201D said Malcolm, and he spoke very gently, for he understood that\r\nlove and not hate was at the root of his friend\u2019s anger and injustice,\r\n\u201Cgien ye winna lippen to me, there\u2019s naething for \u2019t but I maun lippen\r\nto you. Gang hame to yer wife, an\u2019 gi\u2019e her my compliments, an\u2019 tell\r\nher a\u2019 \u2019at\u2019s past atween you an\u2019 me, as near, word for word, as ye can\r\ntell the same; an\u2019 say till her, I pray her to jeedge atween you an\u2019\r\nme--an\u2019 to mak the best o\u2019 me to ye \u2019at she can, for I wad ill thole to\r\nloss yer freenship, Peter.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe same moment came the command for all but passengers to go ashore.\r\nThe men grasped each other\u2019s hand, looked each other in the eyes with\r\nsomething of mutual reproach, and parted--Blue Peter down the river to\r\nScaurnose and Annie, Malcolm to the yacht lying still in the Upper Pool.\r\n\r\nHe saw it taken properly in charge, and arranged for having it towed up\r\nthe river and anchored in the Chelsea Reach.\r\n\r\nWhen Blue Peter found himself once more safe out at sea, with twelve\r\nhundred yards of canvas spread above him in one mighty wing betwixt\r\nboom and gaff; and the wind blowing half a gale, the weather inside him\r\nbegan to change a little. He began to see that he had not been behaving\r\naltogether as a friend ought. It was not that he saw reason for being\r\nbetter satisfied with Malcolm or his conduct, but reason for being\r\nworse satisfied with himself; and the consequence was that he grew\r\nstill angrier with Malcolm, and the wrong he had done him seemed more\r\nand more an unpardonable one.\r\n\r\nWhen he was at length seated on the top of the coach running betwixt\r\nAberdeen and Fochabers, which would set him down as near Scaurnose as\r\ncoach could go, he began to be doubtful how Annie, formally retained\r\non Malcolm\u2019s side by the message he had to give her, would judge in\r\nthe question between them; for what did she know of theatres and such\r\nplaces? And the doubt strengthened as he neared home. The consequence\r\nwas that he felt in no haste to execute Malcolm\u2019s commission; and\r\nhence, the delights of greeting over, Annie was the first to open her\r\nbag of troubles: Mr Crathie had given them notice to quit at Midsummer.\r\n\r\n\u201CJist what I micht hae expeckit!\u201D cried Blue Peter, starting up. \u201CWoe\r\nbe to the man \u2019at puts his trust in princes! I luikit till him to\r\nsave the fisher-fowk, an\u2019 no to the Lord; an\u2019 the tooer o\u2019 Siloam\u2019s\r\nfa\u2019en upo\u2019 my heid:--what does he, the first thing, but turn his ain\r\nauld freen\u2019s oot o\u2019 the sma beild they had! That his father nor his\r\ngran\u2019father, \u2019at was naither o\u2019 them God-fearin\u2019 men, wad never hae put\r\ntheir han\u2019 till. Eh, wuman! but my hert\u2019s sair \u2019ithin me. To think o\u2019\r\nMa\u2019colm MacPhail turnin\u2019 his back upo\u2019 them \u2019at\u2019s been freens wi\u2019 \u2019im\r\nsin ever he was a wee loonie, rinnin\u2019 aboot in coaties!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHoot, man! what\u2019s gotten intill yer heid?\u201D returned his wife. \u201CIt\u2019s no\r\nMa\u2019colm; it\u2019s the illwully factor. Bide ye till he comes till \u2019s ain,\r\nan\u2019 Maister Crathie \u2019ll hae to lauch o\u2019 the wrang side o\u2019 \u2019s mou\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut thereupon Peter began his tale of how he had fared in London, and\r\nin the excitement of keenly anticipated evil, and with his recollection\r\nof events wrapped in the mist of a displeasure which had deepened\r\nduring his journey, he so clothed the facts of Malcolm\u2019s conduct in the\r\ngarments of his own feelings that the mind of Annie Mair also became\r\nspeedily possessed with the fancy that their friend\u2019s good fortune\r\nhad upset his moral equilibrium, and that he had not only behaved to\r\nher husband with pride and arrogance, breaking all the ancient bonds\r\nof friendship between them, but had tried to seduce him from the ways\r\nof righteousness by inveigling him into a playhouse, where marvels\r\nof wickedness were going on at the very time. She wept a few bitter\r\ntears of disappointment, dried them hastily, lifted her head high, and\r\nproceeded to set her affairs in order as if death were at the door.\r\n\r\nFor indeed it was to them as a death to leave Scaurnose. True, Annie\r\ncame from inland, and was not of the fisher-race, but this part of\r\nthe coast she had known from childhood, and in this cottage all her\r\nmarried years had been spent, while banishment of the sort involved\r\nbanishment from every place they knew, for all the neighbourhood was\r\nequally under the power of the factor. And poor as their accommodation\r\nhere was, they had plenty of open air and land room; whereas if they\r\nshould be compelled to go to any of the larger ports, it would be to\r\ncircumstances greatly inferior, and a neighbourhood in all probability\r\nvery undesirable for their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nMR GRAHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Malcolm at length reached his lodging, he found there a letter\r\nfrom Miss Horn, containing the much desired information as to where\r\nthe schoolmaster was to be found in the London wilderness. It was\r\nnow getting rather late, and the dusk of a spring night had begun to\r\ngather; but little more than the breadth of the Regent\u2019s Park lay\r\nbetween him and his best friend--his only one in London-- and he set\r\nout immediately for Camden Town.\r\n\r\nThe relation between him and his late schoolmaster was indeed of the\r\nstrongest and closest. Long before Malcolm was born, and ever since,\r\nhad Alexander Graham loved Malcolm\u2019s mother; but not until within the\r\nlast few months had he learned that Malcolm was the son of Griselda\r\nCampbell. The discovery was to the schoolmaster like the bursting out\r\nof a known flower on an unknown plant. He knew then, not why he had\r\nloved the boy, for he loved every one of his pupils more or less, but\r\nwhy he had loved him with such a peculiar tone of affection.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely evening. There had been rain in the afternoon as\r\nMalcolm walked home from the Pool, but before the sun set, it had\r\ncleared up; and as he went through the park towards the dingy suburb,\r\nthe first heralds of the returning youth of the year met him from all\r\nsides in the guise of odours--not yet those of flowers, but the more\r\nethereal if less sweet, scents of buds and grass, and ever pure earth\r\nmoistened with the waters of heaven. And to his surprise he found that\r\nhis sojourn in a great city, although as yet so brief, had already made\r\nthe open earth with its corn and grass more dear to him and wonderful.\r\nBut when he left the park, and crossed the Hampstead Road into a dreary\r\nregion of dwellings crowded and commonplace as the thoughts of a\r\nworshipper of Mammon, houses upon houses, here and there shepherded by\r\na tall spire, it was hard to believe that the spring was indeed _coming\r\nslowly up this way_.\r\n\r\nAfter not a few inquiries, he found himself at a stationer\u2019s shop, a\r\npoor little place, and learned that Mr Graham lodged over it, and was\r\nthen at home.\r\n\r\nHe was shown up into a shabby room, with an iron bedstead, a chest of\r\ndrawers daubed with sickly paint, a table with a stained red cover, a\r\nfew bookshelves in a recess over the wash-stand, and two chairs seated\r\nwith hair-cloth. On one of these, by the side of a small fire in a\r\nneglected grate, sat the schoolmaster reading his Plato. On the table\r\nbeside him lay his Greek New Testament, and an old edition of George\r\nHerbert. He looked up as the door opened, and, notwithstanding his\r\nstrange dress, recognising at once his friend and pupil, rose hastily,\r\nand welcomed him with hand and eyes and countenance, but without word\r\nspoken. For a few moments the two stood silent, holding each the\r\nother\u2019s hand, and gazing each in the other\u2019s eyes, then sat down, still\r\nspeechless, one on each side of the fire.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other and smiled, and again a minute passed. Then\r\nthe schoolmaster rose, rang the bell, and when it was answered by a\r\nrather careworn young woman, requested her to bring tea.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry I cannot give you cakes or fresh butter, my lord,\u201D he said\r\nwith a smile, and they were the first words spoken. \u201CThe former is not\r\nto be had, and the latter is beyond my means. But what I have will\r\ncontent one who is able to count that abundance which many would count\r\nprivation.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe spoke in the choice word, measured phrase, and stately speech which\r\nWordsworth says \u201Cgrave livers do in Scotland use,\u201D but under it all\r\nrang a tone of humour, as if he knew the form of his utterance too\r\nimportant for the subject-matter of it, and would gently amuse with it\r\nboth his visitor and himself.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of middle height, but so thin that notwithstanding a\r\nslight stoop in the shoulders, he looked rather tall; much on the young\r\nside of fifty, but apparently a good way on the other, partly from\r\nthe little hair he had being grey. He had sandy-coloured whiskers,\r\nand a shaven chin. Except his large sweetly closed mouth, and rather\r\nlong upper lip, there was nothing very notable in his features. At\r\nordinary moments, indeed, there was nothing in his appearance other\r\nthan insignificant to the ordinary observer. His eyes were of a pale\r\nquiet blue, but when he smiled they sparkled and throbbed with light.\r\nHe wore the same old black tail-coat he had worn last in his school at\r\nPortlossie, but the white neckcloth he had always been seen in there\r\nhad given place to a black one: that was the sole change in the aspect\r\nof the man.\r\n\r\nAbout Portlossie he had been greatly respected, notwithstanding the\r\nrumour that he was a \u201Cstickit minister,\u201D that is, one who had failed\r\nin the attempt to preach; and when the presbytery dismissed him on the\r\ncharge of heresy, there had been many tears on the part of his pupils,\r\nand much childish defiance of his unenviable successor.\r\n\r\nFew words passed between the two men until they had had their tea,\r\nand then followed a long talk, Malcolm first explaining his present\r\nposition, and then answering many questions of the master as to how\r\nthings had gone since he left. Next followed anxious questions on\r\nMalcolm\u2019s side as to how his friend found himself in the prison of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do miss the air, and the laverocks (_skylarks_), and the gowans,\u201D\r\nhe confessed; \u201Cbut I have them all in my mind, and at my age a man\r\nought to be able to satisfy himself with the idea of a thing in his\r\nsoul. Of outer things that have contributed to his inward growth, the\r\nmemory alone may then well be enough. The sights which, when I lie down\r\nto sleep, rise before that inward eye Wordsworth calls the bliss of\r\nsolitude, have upon me power almost of a spiritual vision, so purely\r\nradiant are they of that which dwells in them, the divine thought which\r\nis their substance, their _hypostasis_. My boy! I doubt if you can tell\r\nwhat it is to know the presence of the living God in and about you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI houp I hae a bit notion o\u2019 \u2019t, sir,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut believe me that in any case, however much a man may have of it,\r\nhe may have it endlessly more. Since I left the cottage where I hoped\r\nto end my days under the shadow of the house of your ancestors, since\r\nI came into this region of bricks and smoke, and the crowded tokens\r\ntoo plain of want and care, I have found a reality in the things I had\r\nbeen trying to teach you at Portlossie, such as I had before imagined\r\nonly in my best moments. And more still: I am now far better able to\r\nunderstand how it must have been with our Lord when he was trying to\r\nteach the men and women of Palestine to have faith in God. Depend upon\r\nit, we get our best use of life in learning by the facts of its ebb and\r\nflow to understand the Son of Man. And again, when we understand Him,\r\nthen only do we understand our life and ourselves. Never can we know\r\nthe majesty of the will of God concerning us except by understanding\r\nJesus and the work the Father gave Him to do. Now, nothing is of a more\r\nheavenly delight than to enter into a dusky room in the house of your\r\nfriend, and there, with a blow of the heavenly rod, draw light from\r\nthe dark wall--open a window, a fountain of the eternal light, and\r\nlet in the truth which is the life of the world. Joyously would a man\r\nspend his life, right joyously even if the road led to the gallows,\r\nin showing the grandest he sees--the splendid purities of the divine\r\nreligion--the mountain top up to which the voice of God is ever calling\r\nhis children. Yes, I can understand even how a man might live, like the\r\ngood hermits of old, in triumphant meditation upon such all-satisfying\r\ntruths, and let the waves of the world\u2019s time wash by him in unheeded\r\nflow until his cell changed to his tomb, and his spirit soared free.\r\nBut to spend your time in giving little lessons when you have great\r\nones to give; in teaching the multiplication table the morning after\r\nyou made at midnight a grand discovery upon the very summits of the\r\nmoonlit mountain range of the mathematics; in enforcing the old law,\r\n_Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself_, when you know in your own\r\nheart that not a soul can ever learn to keep it without first learning\r\nto fulfil an infinitely greater one--_to love his neighbour even as\r\nChrist hath loved him_ --then indeed one may well grow disheartened,\r\nand feel as if he were not in the place prepared for, and at the work\r\nrequired of him. But it is just then that he must go back to school\r\nhimself and learn not only the patience of God who keeps the whole\r\ndull obstinate world alive, while generation after generation is born\r\nand vanishes, and of the mighty multitude only one here and there\r\nrises up from the fetters of humanity into the freedom of the sons of\r\nGod--and yet goes on teaching the whole, and bringing every man who\r\nwill but turn his ear a little towards the voice that calls him, nearer\r\nand nearer to the second birth--of sonship and liberty--not only this\r\ndivine patience must he learn, but the divine insight as well, which\r\nin every form spies the reflex of the truth it cannot contain, and\r\nin every lowliest lesson sees the highest drawn nearer, and the soul\r\ngrowing alive unto God.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nRICHMOND PARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day at noon, mounted on Kelpie, Malcolm was in attendance\r\nupon his mistress, who was eager after a gallop in Richmond Park. Lord\r\nLiftore, who had intended to accompany her, had not made his appearance\r\nyet, but Florimel did not seem the less desirous of setting out at the\r\ntime she had appointed Malcolm. The fact was she had said one o\u2019clock\r\nto Liftore, intending twelve, that she might get away without him.\r\nKelpie seemed on her good behaviour, and they started quietly enough.\r\nBy the time they had got out of the park upon the Kensington Road,\r\nhowever, the evil spirit had begun to wake in her. But even when she\r\nwas quietest, she was nothing to be trusted, and about London Malcolm\r\nfound he dared never let his thoughts go, or take his attention\r\nquite off her ears. They got to Kew Bridge in safety nevertheless,\r\nthough whether they were to get safely across was doubtful all the\r\ntime they were upon it, for again and again she seemed on the very\r\npoint of clearing the stone balustrade, but for the terrible bit and\r\nchain without which Malcolm never dared ride her. Still, whatever her\r\ncaracoles or escapades, they caused Florimel nothing but amusement, for\r\nher confidence in Malcolm--that he could do whatever he believed he\r\ncould--was unbounded. They got through Richmond--with some trouble, but\r\nhardly were they well into the park, when Lord Liftore, followed by his\r\ngroom, came suddenly up behind them at such a rate as quite destroyed\r\nthe small stock of equanimity Kelpie had to go upon. She bolted.\r\n\r\nFlorimel was a good rider, and knew herself quite mistress of her\r\nhorse, and if she now followed, it was at her own will, and with a\r\ndesign; she wanted to make the horses behind her bolt also if she\r\ncould. His lordship came flying after her, and his groom after him,\r\nbut she kept increasing her pace until they were all at full stretch,\r\nthundering over the grass--upon which Malcolm had at once turned\r\nKelpie, giving her little rein and plenty of spur. Gradually Florimel\r\nslackened speed, and at last pulled up suddenly. Liftore and his groom\r\nwent past her like the wind. She turned at right angles and galloped\r\nback to the road. There, on a gaunt thoroughbred, with a furnace of old\r\nlife in him yet, sat Lenorme, whom she had already passed and signalled\r\nto remain thereabout. They drew alongside of each other, but they did\r\nnot shake hands; they only looked each in the other\u2019s eyes, and for a\r\nfew moments neither spoke. The three riders were now far away over the\r\npark, and still Kelpie held on and the other horses after her.\r\n\r\n\u201CI little expected _such_ a pleasure,\u201D said Lenorme.\r\n\r\n\u201CI meant to give it you, though,\u201D said Florimel, with a merry laugh.\r\n\u201CBravo, Kelpie! take them with you,\u201D she cried, looking after the\r\nstill retreating horsemen. \u201CI have got a familiar since I saw you\r\nlast, Raoul,\u201D she went on. \u201CSee if I don\u2019t get some good for us out of\r\nhim!--We\u2019ll move gently along the road here, and by the time Liftore\u2019s\r\nhorse is spent, we shall be ready for a good gallop. I want to tell you\r\nall about it. I did not mean Liftore to be here when I sent you word,\r\nbut he has been too much for me.\u201D\r\n\r\nLenorme replied with a look of gratitude; and as they walked their\r\nhorses along, she told him all concerning Malcolm and Kelpie.\r\n\r\n\u201CLiftore hates him already,\u201D she said, \u201Cand I can hardly wonder; but\r\n_you_ must not, for you will find him useful. He is one I can depend\r\nupon. You should have seen the look Liftore gave him when he told him\r\nhe could not sit his mare! It would have been worth gold to you.\u201D\r\n\r\nLenorme winced a little.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe thinks no end of his riding,\u201D Florimel continued; \u201Cbut if it were\r\nnot so improper to have secrets with another gentleman, I would tell\r\nyou that he rides--just pretty well.\u201D\r\n\r\nLenorme\u2019s great brow gloomed over his eyes like the Eiger in a mist,\r\nbut he said nothing yet.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe wants to ride Kelpie, and I have told my groom to let him have her.\r\nPerhaps she\u2019ll break his neck.\u201D\r\n\r\nLenorme smiled grimly.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou wouldn\u2019t mind, would you, Raoul?\u201D added Florimel, with a roguish\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n\u201CWould you mind telling me, Florimel, what you mean by the impropriety\r\nof having secrets with another gentleman? Am _I_ the other gentleman?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, of course! You know Liftore imagines he has only to name the day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you allow an idiot like that to cherish such a degrading idea of\r\nyou.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, Raoul! what does it matter what a fool like him thinks?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you don\u2019t mind it, I do. I feel it an insult to me that he should\r\ndare think of you like that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. I suppose I shall have to marry him some day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLady Lossie, do you want to make me hate you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t be foolish, Raoul. It won\u2019t be to-morrow--nor the next day.\r\n_Freuet euch des Lebens!_\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CO Florimel! what is to come of this? Do you want to break my heart?\r\n--I hate to talk rubbish. You won\u2019t kill me--you will only ruin my\r\nwork, and possibly drive me mad.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel drew close to his side, laid her hand on his arm, and looked\r\nin his face with a witching entreaty.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe have the present, Raoul,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CSo has the butterfly,\u201D answered Lenorme; \u201Cbut I had rather be the\r\ncaterpillar with a future.--Why don\u2019t you put a stop to the man\u2019s\r\nlovemaking? He can\u2019t love you or any woman. He does not know what love\r\nmeans. It makes me ill to hear him when he thinks he is paying you\r\nirresistible compliments. They are so silly! so mawkish! Good heavens,\r\nFlorimel! can you imagine that smile every day and always? Like the\r\nrest of his class he seems to think himself perfectly justified in\r\nmaking fools of women. _I_ want to help you to grow as beautiful as\r\nGod meant you to be when he thought of you first. I want you to be my\r\nembodied vision of life, that I may for ever worship at your feet--live\r\nin you, die with you: such bliss, even were there nothing beyond, would\r\nbe enough for the heart of a God to bestow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CStop, stop, Raoul; I\u2019m not worthy of such love,\u201D said Florimel, again\r\nlaying her hand on his arm. \u201CI do wish for your sake I had been born a\r\nvillage-girl.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you had been, then I might have wished for your sake that I had\r\nbeen born a marquis. As it is I would rather be a painter than any\r\nnobleman in Europe--that is, with you to love me. Your love is my\r\npatent of nobility. But I may glorify what you love--and tell you that\r\nI can confer something on you also--what none of your noble admirers\r\ncan.--God forgive me! you will make me hate them all!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CRaoul, this won\u2019t do at all,\u201D said Florimel, with the authority that\r\nshould belong only to the one in the right. And indeed for the moment\r\nshe felt the dignity of restraining a too impetuous passion. \u201CYou will\r\nspoil everything. I dare not come to your studio if you are going to\r\nbehave like this. It would be very wrong of me. And if I am never to\r\ncome and see you, I shall die--I know I shall.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe girl was so full of the delight of the secret love between them,\r\nthat she cared only to live in the present as if there were no future\r\nbeyond: Lenorme wanted to make that future like but better than the\r\npresent. The word marriage put Florimel in a rage. She thought herself\r\nsuperior to Lenorme, because he, in the dread of losing her, would have\r\nher marry him at once, while she was more than content with the bliss\r\nof seeing him now and then. Often and often her foolish talk stung him\r\nwith bitter pain--worst of all when it compelled him to doubt whether\r\nthere was that in her to be loved as he was capable of loving. Yet\r\nalways the conviction that there was a deep root of nobleness in her\r\nnature again got uppermost; and, had it not been so, I fear he would,\r\nnevertheless, have continued to prove her irresistible as often as she\r\nchose to exercise upon him the full might of her witcheries. At one\r\nmoment she would reveal herself in such a sudden rush of tenderness\r\nas seemed possible only to one ready to become his altogether and for\r\never; the next she would start away as if she had never meant anything,\r\nand talk as if not a thought were in her mind beyond the cultivation\r\nof a pleasant acquaintance doomed to pass with the season, if not with\r\nthe final touches to her portrait. Or she would fall to singing some\r\nsong he had taught her, more likely a certain one he had written in a\r\npassionate mood of bitter tenderness, with the hope of stinging her\r\nlove to some show of deeper life; but would, while she sang, look with\r\nmerry defiance in his face, as if she adopted in seriousness what he\r\nhad written in loving and sorrowful satire.\r\n\r\nThey rode in silence for some hundred yards. At length he spoke,\r\nreplying to her last asseveration.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen what _can_ you gain, child,\u201D he said----\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you dare to call _me_ child--a marchioness in my own right!\u201D she\r\ncried, playfully threatening him with uplifted whip, in the handle of\r\nwhich the little jewels sparkled.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat, then, can you gain, my lady marchioness,\u201D he resumed, with soft\r\nseriousness, and a sad smile, \u201Cby marrying one of your own rank?--I\r\nshould lay new honour and consideration at your feet. I am young. I\r\nhave done fairly well already. But I have done nothing to what I could\r\ndo now, if only my heart lay safe in the port of peace:--you know\r\nwhere alone that is for me my--lady marchioness. And you know too that\r\nthe names of great painters go down with honour from generation to\r\ngeneration, when my lord this or my lord that is remembered only as a\r\nlabel to the picture that makes the painter famous. I am not a great\r\npainter yet, but I will be one if you will be good to me. And men shall\r\nsay, when they look on your portrait, in ages to come: No wonder he was\r\nsuch a painter when he had such a woman to paint.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe spoke the words with a certain tone of dignified playfulness.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen shall the woman sit to you again, painter?\u201D said Florimel-- sole\r\nreply to his rhapsody.\r\n\r\nThe painter thought a little. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t like that tire-woman of yours. She has two evil eyes-- one for\r\neach of us. I have again and again caught their expression when they\r\nwere upon us, and she thought none were upon her: I can see without\r\nlifting my head when I am painting, and my art has made me quick at\r\ncatching expressions, and, I hope, at interpreting them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t altogether like her myself,\u201D said Florimel. \u201COf late I am not\r\nso sure of her as I used to be. But what can I do? I must have somebody\r\nwith me, you know.--A thought strikes me. Yes. I won\u2019t say now what it\r\nis lest I should disappoint my--painter; but-- yes--you shall see what\r\nI will dare for you, faithless man!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe set off at a canter, turned on to the grass, and rode to meet\r\nLiftore, whom she saw in the distance returning, followed by the two\r\ngrooms.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome on, Raoul,\u201D she cried, looking back; \u201CI must account for you. He\r\nsees I have not been alone.\u201D\r\n\r\nLenorme joined her, and they rode along side by side.\r\n\r\nThe earl and the painter knew each other: as they drew near, the\r\npainter lifted his hat, and the earl nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou owe Mr Lenorme some acknowledgment, my lord, for taking charge of\r\nme after your sudden desertion,\u201D said Florimel. \u201CWhy did you gallop off\r\nin such a mad fashion?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am sorry,\u201D began Liftore a little embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\u201COh! don\u2019t trouble yourself to apologise,\u201D said Florimel. \u201CI have\r\nalways understood that great horsemen find a horse more interesting\r\nthan a lady. It is a mark of their breed, I am told.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe knew that Liftore would not be ready to confess he could not hold\r\nhis hack.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf it hadn\u2019t been for Mr Lenorme,\u201D she added, \u201CI should have been left\r\nwithout a squire, subject to any whim of my four-footed servant here.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she patted the neck of her horse. The earl, on his side,\r\nhad been looking the painter\u2019s horse up and down with a would-be\r\nhumorous expression of criticism.\r\n\r\n\u201CI beg your pardon, marchioness,\u201D he replied; \u201Cbut you pulled up so\r\nquickly that we shot past you. I thought you were close behind, and\r\npreferred following.--Seen his best days, eh, Lenorme?\u201D he concluded,\r\nwilling to change the subject.\r\n\r\n\u201CI fancy he doesn\u2019t think so,\u201D returned the painter. \u201CI bought him out\r\nof a butterman\u2019s cart, three months ago. He\u2019s been coming to himself\r\never since. Look at his eye, my lord.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you knowing in horses, then?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t say I am, beyond knowing how to treat them something like\r\nhuman beings.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s no ill,\u201D said Malcolm to himself. He was just near enough, on\r\nthe pawing and foaming Kelpie, to catch what was passing.-- \u201CThe fallow\r\n\u2019ll du. He\u2019s worth a score o\u2019 sic yerls as yon.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHa! ha!\u201D said his lordship; \u201CI don\u2019t know about that.--He\u2019s not\r\nthe best of tempers, I can see. But look at that demon of Lady\r\nLossie\u2019s--that black mare there! I wish you could teach her some of\r\nyour humanity.\r\n\r\n\u201C--By the way, Florimel, I think now we _are_ upon the grass,\u201D-- he\r\nsaid it loftily, as if submitting to an injustice--\u201CI will presume to\r\nmount the reprobate.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe gallop had communicated itself to Liftore\u2019s blood, and, besides,\r\nhe thought after such a run Kelpie would be less extravagant in her\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe is at your service,\u201D said Florimel.\r\n\r\nHe dismounted, his groom rode up, he threw him the reins, and called\r\nMalcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CBring your mare here, my man,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nMalcolm rode her up half way, and dismounted.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf your lordship is going to ride her,\u201D he said, \u201Cwill you please get\r\non her here. I would rather not take her near the other horses.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, you know her better than I do.--You and I must ride about the\r\nsame length, I think.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo saying his lordship carelessly measured the stirrup-leather against\r\nhis arm, and took the reins.\r\n\r\n\u201CStand well forward, my lord. Don\u2019t mind turning your back to her head:\r\nI\u2019ll look after her teeth; you mind her hind-hoof,\u201D said Malcolm, with\r\nher head in one hand and the stirrup in the other.\r\n\r\nKelpie stood rigid as a rock, and the earl swung himself up cleverly\r\nenough. But hardly was he in the saddle, and Malcolm had just let her\r\ngo, when she plunged and lashed out; then, having failed to unseat her\r\nrider, stood straight up on her hind legs.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive her her head, my lord,\u201D cried Malcolm.\r\n\r\nShe stood swaying in the air, Liftore\u2019s now frightened face half hid in\r\nher mane, and his spurs stuck in her flanks.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome off her, my lord, for God\u2019s sake. Off with you!\u201D cried Malcolm,\r\nas he leaped at her head. \u201CShe\u2019ll be on her back in a moment.\u201D\r\n\r\nLiftore only clung the harder. Malcolm caught her head--just in time:\r\nshe was already falling backwards.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet all go, my lord. Throw yourself off.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe swung her towards him with all his strength, and just as his\r\nlordship fell off behind her, she fell sideways to Malcolm, and clear\r\nof Liftore.\r\n\r\nMalcolm was on the side away from the little group, and their own\r\nhorses were excited, so those who had looked breathless on at the\r\nstruggle could not tell how he had managed it, but when they expected\r\nto see the groom writhing under the weight of the demoness, there he\r\nwas with his knee upon her head--while Liftore was gathering himself up\r\nfrom the ground, only just beyond the reach of her iron-shod hoofs.\r\n\r\n\u201CThank God!\u201D said Florimel, \u201Cthere is no harm done.--Well, have you had\r\nenough of her yet, Liftore?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPretty nearly, I think,\u201D said his lordship, with an attempt at a\r\nlaugh, as he walked rather feebly and foolishly towards his horse. He\r\nmounted with some difficulty, and looked very pale.\r\n\r\n\u201CI hope you\u2019re not much hurt,\u201D said Florimel kindly, as she moved\r\nalongside of him.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot in the least--only disgraced,\u201D he answered, almost angrily. \u201CThe\r\nbrute\u2019s a perfect Satan. You _must_ part with her. With such a horse\r\nand such a groom you\u2019ll get yourself talked of all over London. I\r\nbelieve the fellow himself was at the bottom of it. You really _must_\r\nsell her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI would, my lord, if _you_ were my groom,\u201D answered Florimel, whom his\r\naccusation of Malcolm had filled with angry contempt; and she moved\r\naway towards the still prostrate mare.\r\n\r\nMalcolm was quietly seated on her head. She had ceased sprawling, and\r\nlay nearly motionless, but for the heaving of her sides with her huge\r\ninhalations. She knew from experience that struggling was useless.\r\n\r\n\u201CI beg your pardon, my lady,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cbut I daren\u2019t get up.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow long do you mean to sit there then?\u201D she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf your ladyship wouldn\u2019t mind riding home without me, I would give\r\nher a good half hour of it. I always do when she throws herself over\r\nlike that.--I\u2019ve gat my Epictetus?\u201D he asked himself, feeling in his\r\ncoat pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo as you please,\u201D answered his mistress. \u201CLet me see you when you get\r\nhome. I should like to know you are safe.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, my lady; there\u2019s little fear of that,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\nFlorimel returned to the gentlemen, and they rode homewards. On the way\r\nshe said suddenly to the earl,\r\n\r\n\u201CCan you tell me, Liftore, who Epictetus was?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know,\u201D answered his lordship. \u201COne of the old\r\nfellows.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe turned to Lenorme. Happily the Christian heathen was not altogether\r\nunknown to the painter.\r\n\r\n\u201CMay I inquire why your ladyship asks?\u201D he said, when he had told all\r\nhe could at the moment recollect.\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause,\u201D she answered, \u201CI left my groom sitting on his horse\u2019s head\r\nreading Epictetus.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBy Jove!\u201D exclaimed Liftore. \u201CHa! ha! ha! In the original, I suppose!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t doubt it,\u201D said Florimel.\r\n\r\nIn about two hours Malcolm reported himself. Lord Liftore had gone\r\nhome, they told him. The painter-fellow, as Wallis called him, had\r\nstayed to lunch, but was now gone also, and Lady Lossie was alone in\r\nthe drawing-room.\r\n\r\nShe sent for him.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am glad to see you safe, MacPhail,\u201D she said. \u201CIt is clear your\r\nKelpie--don\u2019t be alarmed; I am not going to make you part with her--but\r\nit is clear she won\u2019t always do for you to attend me upon. Suppose now\r\nI wanted to dismount and make a call, or go into a shop?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a sort of a friendship between your Abbot and her, my lady;\r\nshe would stand all the better if I had him to hold.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, but how would you put me up again?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI never thought of that, my lady. Of course I daren\u2019t let you come\r\nnear Kelpie.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCould you trust yourself to buy another horse to ride after me about\r\ntown?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, my lady, not without a ten days\u2019 trial. If lies stuck like London\r\nmud, there\u2019s many a horse would never be seen again. But there\u2019s Mr\r\nLenorme! If he would go with me, I fancy between us we could do pretty\r\nwell.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! a good idea,\u201D returned his mistress. \u201CBut what makes you think of\r\nhim?\u201D she added, willing enough to talk about him.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe look of the gentleman and his horse together, and what I heard him\r\nsay,\u201D answered Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat did you hear him say?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat he knew he had to treat horses something like human beings. I\u2019ve\r\noften fancied, within the last few months, that God does with some\r\npeople something like as I do with Kelpie.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI know nothing about theology.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t fancy you do, my lady; but this concerns biography rather than\r\ntheology. No one could tell what I meant except he had watched his own\r\nhistory, and that of people he knew.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd horses too?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s hard to get at their insides, my lady, but I suspect it must be\r\nso. I\u2019ll ask Mr Graham.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat Mr Graham?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe schoolmaster of Portlossie.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs he in London, then?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, my lady. He believed too much to please the presbytery, and they\r\nturned him out.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI should like to see him. He was very attentive to my father on his\r\ndeath-bed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYour ladyship will never know till you are dead yourself what Mr\r\nGraham did for my lord.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you mean? What could he do for him?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe helped him through sore trouble of mind, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel was silent for a little, then repeated, \u201CI should like to see\r\nhim. I ought to pay him some attention. Couldn\u2019t I make them give him\r\nhis school again?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know about that, my lady; but I am sure he would not take it\r\nagainst the will of the presbytery.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI should like to do something for him. Ask him to call.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf your ladyship lays your commands upon me,\u201D answered Malcolm;\r\n\u201Cotherwise I would rather not.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy so, pray?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause, except he can be of any use to you, he will not come.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I want to be of use to him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow, if I may ask, my lady?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat I can\u2019t exactly say on the spur of the moment. I must know the\r\nman first--especially if you are right in supposing he would not enjoy\r\na victory over the presbytery. _I_ should. He wouldn\u2019t take money, I\r\nfear.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CExcept it came of love or work, he would put it from him as he would\r\nbrush the dust from his coat.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI could introduce him to good society. That is no small privilege to\r\none of his station.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe has more of that and better than your ladyship could give him. He\r\nholds company with Socrates and St. Paul, and greater still.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut they\u2019re not like living people.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery like them, my lady--only far better company in general. But Mr\r\nGraham would leave Plato himself--yes, or St. Paul either, though\r\nhe were sitting beside him in the flesh, to go and help any old\r\nwasherwoman that wanted him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen I want him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, my lady, you don\u2019t want him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow dare you say so?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you did, you would go to him.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel\u2019s eyes flashed, and her pretty lip curled. She turned to her\r\nwriting-table, annoyed with herself that she could not find a fitting\r\nword wherewith to rebuke his presumption--rudeness, was it not?--and\r\na feeling of angry shame arose in her, that she, the Marchioness of\r\nLossie, had not dignity enough to prevent her own groom from treating\r\nher like a child. But he was far too valuable to quarrel with.\r\n\r\nShe sat down and wrote a note.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere,\u201D she said, \u201Ctake that note to Mr Lenorme. I have asked him to\r\nhelp you in the choice of a horse.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat price would you be willing to go to, my lady?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI leave that to Mr Lenorme\u2019s judgment--and your own,\u201D she added.\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, my lady,\u201D said Malcolm, and was leaving the room, when\r\nFlorimel called him back.\r\n\r\n\u201CNext time you see Mr Graham,\u201D she said, \u201Cgive him my compliments, and\r\nask him if I can be of any service to him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll do that, my lady. I am sure he will take it very kindly.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel made no answer, and Malcolm went to find the painter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nPAINTER AND GROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe address upon the note Malcolm had to deliver took him to a house\r\nin Chelsea--one of a row of beautiful old houses fronting the Thames,\r\nwith little gardens between them and the road. The one he sought was\r\novergrown with creepers, most of them now covered with fresh spring\r\nbuds. The afternoon had turned cloudy, and a cold east wind came up\r\nthe river, which, as the tide was falling, raised little waves on its\r\nsurface and made Malcolm think of the herring. Somehow, as he went up\r\nto the door, a new chapter of his life seemed about to commence.\r\n\r\nThe servant who took the note, returned immediately, and showed him up\r\nto the study, a large back room, looking over a good-sized garden, with\r\nstables on one side. There Lenorme sat at his easel.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D he said, \u201CI\u2019m glad to see that wild animal has not quite torn you\r\nto pieces. Take a chair. What on earth made you bring such an incarnate\r\nfury to London?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI see well enough now, sir, she\u2019s not exactly the one for London use,\r\nbut if you had once ridden her, you would never quite enjoy another\r\nbetween your knees.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s such an infernal brute!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou can\u2019t say too ill of her. But I fancy a gaol chaplain sometimes\r\ntakes the most interest in the worst villain under his charge. I should\r\nbe a proud man to make _her_ fit to live with decent people.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll be too much for you. At last you\u2019ll have to part\r\nwith her, I fear.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf she had bitten you as often as she has me, sir, you wouldn\u2019t part\r\nwith her. Besides, it would be wrong to sell her. She would only be\r\nworse with anyone else. But, indeed, though you will hardly believe it,\r\nshe is better than she was.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen what must she have been!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou may well say that, sir!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHere your mistress tells me you want my assistance in choosing another\r\nhorse.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, sir--to attend upon her in London.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t profess to be knowing in horses: what made you think of me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI saw how you sat your own horse, sir, and I heard you say you bought\r\nhim out of a butterman\u2019s cart, and treated him like a human being:\r\nthat was enough for me, sir. I\u2019ve long had the notion that the beasts,\r\npoor things, have a half-sleeping, half-waking human soul in them, and\r\nit was a great pleasure to hear you say something of the same sort.\r\n\u2018That gentleman,\u2019 I said to myself, \u2018--he and I would understand one\r\nanother.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am glad you think so,\u201D said Lenorme, with entire courtesy.--It was\r\nnot merely that the very doubtful recognition of his profession by\r\nsociety had tended to keep him clear of his prejudices, but both as a\r\npainter and a man he found the young fellow exceedingly attractive;--as\r\na painter from the rare combination of such strength with such beauty,\r\nand as a man from a certain yet rarer clarity of nature which to\r\nthe vulgar observer seems fatuity until he has to encounter it in\r\naction, when the contrast is like meeting a thunderbolt. Naturally the\r\ndishonest takes the honest for a fool. Beyond his understanding, he\r\nimagines him beneath it. But Lenorme, although so much more a man of\r\nthe world, was able in a measure to look into Malcolm and appreciate\r\nhim. His nature and his art combined in enabling him to do this.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou see, sir,\u201D Malcolm went on, encouraged by the simplicity of\r\nLenorme\u2019s manner, \u201Cif they were nothing like us, how should we be able\r\nto get on with them at all, teach them anything, or come a hair nearer\r\nthem, do what we might? For all her wickedness I firmly believe Kelpie\r\nhas a sort of regard for me--I won\u2019t call it affection, but perhaps it\r\ncomes as near that as may be possible in the time to one of her temper.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow I hope you will permit me, Mr MacPhail,\u201D said Lenorme, who had\r\nbeen paying more attention to Malcolm than to his words, \u201Cto give a\r\nviolent wrench to the conversation, and turn it upon yourself. You\r\ncan\u2019t be surprised, and I hope you will not be annoyed, if I say you\r\nstrike one as not altogether like your calling. No London groom I have\r\never spoken to, in the least resembles you. How is it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI hope you don\u2019t mean to imply, sir, that I don\u2019t know my business,\u201D\r\nreturned Malcolm, laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnything but that! It were nearer the thing to say, that for all I\r\nknow you may understand mine as well.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish I did, sir. Except the pictures at Lossie House and those in\r\nPortland Place, I\u2019ve never seen one in my life. About most of them I\r\nmust say I find it hard to imagine what better the world is for them.\r\nMr Graham says that no work that doesn\u2019t tend to make the world better\r\nmakes it richer. If he were a heathen, he says, he would build a temple\r\nto Ses, the sister of Psyche.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSes?--I don\u2019t remember her,\u201D said Lenorme.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe moth, sir;--\u2018the moth and the rust,\u2019 you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, yes; now I know! Capital! Only more things may tend to make the\r\nworld better than some people think.--Who is this Mr Graham of yours?\r\nHe must be no common man.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are right there, sir; there is not another like him in the whole\r\nworld, I believe.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon Malcolm set himself to give the painter an idea of the\r\nschoolmaster.\r\n\r\nWhen they had talked about him for a little while,\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, all this accounts for your being a scholar,\u201D said Lenorme;\r\n\u201Cbut----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am little enough of that, sir,\u201D interrupted Malcolm. \u201CAny Scotch boy\r\nthat likes to learn finds the way open to him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am aware of that. But were you really reading Epictetus when we left\r\nyou in the park this morning?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, sir: why not?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIn the original?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, sir; but not very readily. I am a poor Greek scholar. But my copy\r\nhas a rough Latin translation on the opposite page, and that helps me\r\nout. It\u2019s not difficult. You would think nothing of it if it had been\r\nCornelius Nepos, or Cordery\u2019s Colloquies. It\u2019s only a better, not a\r\nmore difficult book.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know about that. It\u2019s not every one who can read Greek that\r\ncan understand Epictetus. Tell me what you have learned from him?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat would be hard to do. A man is very ready to forget how he came\r\nfirst to think of the things he loves best. You see they are as much\r\na necessity of your being as they are of the man\u2019s who thought them\r\nfirst. I can no more do without the truth than Plato. It is as much my\r\nneedful food and as fully mine to possess as his. His having it, Mr\r\nGraham says, was for my sake as well as his own. --It\u2019s just like what\r\nSir Thomas Browne says about the faces of those we love--that we cannot\r\nretain the idea of them because they are ourselves. Those that help\r\nthe world must be served like their master and a good deal forgotten,\r\nI fancy. Of course they don\u2019t mind it.--I remember another passage I\r\nthink says something to the same purpose--one in Epictetus himself,\u201D\r\ncontinued Malcolm, drawing the little book from his pocket and turning\r\nover the leaves, while Lenorme sat waiting, wondering, and careful not\r\nto interrupt him.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the forty-second chapter, and began to read from the Greek.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve forgotten all the Greek I ever had,\u201D said Lenorme.\r\n\r\nThen Malcolm turned to the opposite page and began to read the Latin.\r\n\r\n\u201CTut! tut!\u201D said Lenorme, \u201CI can\u2019t follow your Scotch pronunciation.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a pity,\u201D said Malcolm: \u201Cit\u2019s the right way.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t doubt it. You Scotch are always in the right! But just read it\r\noff in English--will you?\u201D\r\n\r\nThus adjured, Malcolm read slowly and with choice of word and phrase:--\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018And if any one shall say unto thee, that thou knowest nothing,\r\nnotwithstanding thou must not be vexed: then know thou that thou\r\nhast begun thy work.\u2019--That is,\u201D explained Malcolm, \u201Cwhen you keep\r\nsilence about principles in the presence of those that are incapable\r\nof understanding them.--\u2018For the sheep also do not manifest to the\r\nshepherds how much they have eaten, by producing fodder; but, inwardly\r\ndigesting their food, they produce outwardly wool and milk. And thou\r\ntherefore set not forth principles before the unthinking, but the\r\nactions that result from the digestion of them.\u2019--That last is not\r\nquite literal, but I think it\u2019s about right,\u201D concluded Malcolm,\r\nputting the book again in the breast pocket of his silver-buttoned\r\ncoat. \u201C--That\u2019s the passage I thought of, but I see now it won\u2019t apply.\r\nHe speaks of not saying what you know; I spoke of forgetting where you\r\ngot it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCome now,\u201D said Lenorme, growing more and more interested in his\r\nnew acquaintance, \u201Ctell me something about your life. Account for\r\nyourself.--If you will make a friendship of it, you must do that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will, sir,\u201D said Malcolm, and with the word began to tell him most\r\nthings he could think of as bearing upon his mental history up to and\r\nafter the time also when his birth was disclosed to him. In omitting\r\nthat disclosure he believed he had without it quite accounted for\r\nhimself. Through the whole recital he dwelt chiefly on the lessons and\r\ninfluences of the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I must admit,\u201D said Lenorme when he had ended, \u201Cthat you are no\r\nlonger unintelligible, not to say incredible. You have had a splendid\r\neducation, in which I hope you give the herring and Kelpie their due\r\nshare.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe sat silently regarding him for a few moments. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll tell you what now: if I help you to buy a horse, you must help me\r\nto paint a picture.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m to do that,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cbut if _you_ do,\r\nthat\u2019s enough. I shall only be too happy to do what I can.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen I\u2019ll tell you.--But you\u2019re not to tell _any_body: it\u2019s a\r\nsecret.--I have discovered that there is no suitable portrait of Lady\r\nLossie\u2019s father. It is a great pity. His brother and his father and\r\ngrandfather are all in Portland Place, in Highland costume, as chiefs\r\nof their clan; his place only is vacant. Lady Lossie, however, has in\r\nher possession one or two miniatures of him, which, although badly\r\npainted, I should think may give the outlines of his face and head with\r\ntolerable correctness. From the portraits of his predecessors, and from\r\nLady Lossie herself, I gain some knowledge of what is common to the\r\nfamily; and from all together I hope to gather and paint what will be\r\nrecognizable by her as a likeness of her father--which afterwards I\r\nhope to better by her remarks. These remarks I hope to get first from\r\nher feelings unadulterated by criticism, through the surprise of coming\r\nupon the picture suddenly; afterwards from her judgment at its leisure.\r\nNow I remember seeing you wait at table--the first time I saw you--in\r\nthe Highland dress: will you come to me so dressed, and let me paint\r\nfrom you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll do better than that, sir,\u201D cried Malcolm, eagerly. \u201CI\u2019ll get up\r\nfrom Lossie House my lord\u2019s very dress that he wore when he went to\r\ncourt--his jewelled dirk, and Andrew Ferrara broadsword with the hilt\r\nof real silver. That\u2019ll greatly help your design upon my lady, for he\r\ndressed up in them all more than once just to please her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you,\u201D said Lenorme very heartily; \u201Cthat will be of immense\r\nadvantage. Write at once.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will, sir.--Only I\u2019m a bigger man than my--late master, and you must\r\nmind that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll see to it. You get the clothes, and all the rest of the\r\naccoutrements--rich with barbaric gems and gold, and----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNeither gems nor gold, sir;--honest Scotch cairngorms and plain\r\nsilver,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CI only quoted Milton,\u201D returned Lenorme.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen you should have quoted correctly, sir.--\u2018Showers on her kings\r\nbarbaric pearl and gold,\u2019--that\u2019s the line, and you can\u2019t better it. Mr\r\nGraham always pulled me up if I didn\u2019t quote correctly.-- By-the-bye,\r\nsir, some say it\u2019s _kings barbaric_, but there\u2019s _barbaric gold_ in\r\nVirgil.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI dare say you are right,\u201D said Lenorme. \u201CBut you\u2019re far too learned\r\nfor me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t make game of me, sir. I know two or three books pretty well, and\r\nwhen I get a chance I can\u2019t help talking about them. It\u2019s so seldom\r\nnow I can get a mouthful of Milton. There\u2019s no cave here to go into,\r\nand roll the mimic thunder in your mouth. If the people here heard me\r\nreading loud out, they would call me mad. It\u2019s a mercy in this London,\r\nif a working-man get loneliness enough to say his prayers in!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou do say your prayers then?\u201D asked Lenorme, looking at him curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; don\u2019t you, sir? You had so much sense about the beasts I thought\r\nyou must be a man that said his prayers.\u201D\r\n\r\nLenorme was silent. He was not altogether innocent of saying prayers;\r\nbut of late years it had grown a more formal and gradually a rarer\r\nthing. One reason of this was that it had never come into his head that\r\nGod cared about pictures, or had the slightest interest whether he\r\npainted well or ill. If a man\u2019s earnest calling, to which of necessity\r\nthe greater part of his thought is given, is altogether dissociated\r\nin his mind from his religion, it is not wonderful that his prayers\r\nshould by degrees wither and die. The question is whether they ever\r\nhad much vitality. But one mighty negative was yet true of Lenorme:\r\nhe had not got in his head, still less had he ever cherished in his\r\nheart, the thought that there was anything fine in disbelieving in a\r\nGod, or anything contemptible in imagining communication with a being\r\nof grander essence than himself. That in which Socrates rejoiced with\r\nexultant humility, many a youth now-a-days thinks himself a fine fellow\r\nfor casting from him with ignorant scorn.\r\n\r\nA true conception of the conversation above recorded can hardly be had\r\nexcept my reader will take the trouble to imagine the contrast between\r\nthe Scotch accent and inflection, the largeness and prolongation of\r\nvowel sounds, and, above all, the Scotch tone of Malcolm, and the pure,\r\nclear articulation, and decided utterance of the perfect London speech\r\nof Lenorme. It was something like the difference between the blank\r\nverse of Young and the prose of Burke.\r\n\r\nThe silence endured so long that Malcolm began to fear he had hurt his\r\nnew friend, and thought it better to take his leave.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll go and write to Mrs Courthope--that\u2019s the housekeeper-- to-night,\r\nto send up the things at once. When would it be convenient for you to\r\ngo and look at some horses with me, Mr Lenorme?\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CI shall be at home all to-morrow,\u201D answered the painter, \u201Cand ready to\r\ngo with you any time you like to come for me.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he held out his hand, and they parted like old friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nA LADY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Malcolm took Kelpie into the park, and gave her a\r\ngood breathing. He had thought to jump the rails, and let her have her\r\nhead, but he found there were too many park-keepers and police about:\r\nhe saw he could do little for her that way. He was turning home with\r\nher again when one of her evil fits came upon her, this time taking\r\nits first form in a sudden stiffening of every muscle: she stood stock\r\nstill with flaming eyes. I suspect we human beings know but little of\r\nthe fierceness with which the vortices of passion rage in the more\r\npurely animal natures. This beginning he knew well would end in a wild\r\nparoxysm of rearing and plunging. He had more than once tried the\r\nexorcism of patience, sitting sedate upon her back until she chose to\r\nmove; but on these occasions the tempest that followed had been of the\r\nvery worst description; so that he had concluded it better to bring\r\non the crisis, thereby sure at least to save time; and after he had\r\nadopted this mode with her, attacks of the sort, if no less violent,\r\nhad certainly become fewer. The moment therefore that symptoms of\r\nan approaching fit showed themselves, he used his spiked heels with\r\nvigour. Upon this occasion he had a stiff tussle with her, but as usual\r\ngained the victory, and was riding slowly along the Row, Kelpie tossing\r\nup now her head now her heels in indignant protest against obedience in\r\ngeneral and enforced obedience in particular, when a lady on horseback,\r\nwho had come galloping from the opposite direction, with her groom\r\nbehind her, pulled up, and lifted her hand with imperative grace: she\r\nhad seen something of what had been going on. Malcolm reined in. But\r\nKelpie, after her nature, was now as unwilling to stop as she had been\r\nbefore to proceed, and the fight began again, with some difference of\r\nmovement and aspect, but the spurs once more playing a free part.\r\n\r\n\u201CMan! man!\u201D cried the lady, in most musical reproof, \u201Cdo you know what\r\nyou are about?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt would be a bad job for her and me too if I did not, my lady,\u201D said\r\nMalcolm, whom her appearance and manner impressed with a conviction\r\nof rank, and as he spoke he smiled in the midst of the struggle: he\r\nseldom got angry with Kelpie. But the smile instead of taking from the\r\napparent roughness of his speech, only made his conduct appear in the\r\nlady\u2019s eyes more cruel.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow is it possible you can treat the poor animal so unkindly --and in\r\ncold blood too?\u201D she said, and an indescribable tone of pleading ran\r\nthrough the rebuke. \u201CWhy, her poor sides are actually----\u201D A shudder,\r\nand look of personal distress completed the sentence.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t know what she is, my lady, or you would not think it\r\nnecessary to intercede for her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut if she is naughty, is that any reason why you should be cruel?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, my lady; but it is the best reason why I should try to make her\r\ngood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou will never make her good that way.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CImprovement gives ground for hope,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you must not treat a poor dumb animal as you would a responsible\r\nhuman being.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s not so very poor, my lady. She has all she wants, and does\r\nnothing to earn it--nothing to speak of; and nothing at all with good\r\nwill. For her dumbness, that\u2019s a mercy. If she could speak she wouldn\u2019t\r\nbe fit to live among decent people. But for that matter, if some one\r\nhadn\u2019t taken her in hand, dumb as she is, she would have been shot long\r\nago.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBetter that than live with such usage.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think she would agree with you, my lady. My fear is that, for\r\nas cruel as it looks to your ladyship, take it altogether, she enjoys\r\nthe fight. In any case, I am certain she has more regard for me than\r\nany other being in the universe.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho _can_ have any regard for you,\u201D said the lady very gently, in\r\nutter mistake of his meaning, \u201Cif you have no command of your temper?\r\nYou must learn to rule yourself first.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s true, my lady; and so long as my mare is not able to be a law\r\nto herself, I must be a law to her too.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut have you never heard of the law of kindness? You could do so much\r\nmore without the severity.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWith some natures I grant you, my lady, but not with such as she.\r\nHorse or man--they never show kindness till they have learned fear.\r\nKelpie would have torn me to pieces before now if I had taken your\r\nway with her. But except I can do a great deal more with her yet she\r\nwill be nothing better than a natural brute beast made to be taken and\r\ndestroyed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Bible again!\u201D murmured the lady to herself. \u201COf how much cruelty\r\nhas not that book to bear the blame!\u201D\r\n\r\nAll this time Kelpie was trying hard to get at the lady\u2019s horse to bite\r\nhim. But she did not see that. She was much too distressed-- and was\r\ngrowing more and more so.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish you would let my groom try her,\u201D she said, after a pitiful\r\npause. \u201CHe\u2019s an older and more experienced man than you. He has\r\nchildren. He would show you what can be done by gentleness.\u201D\r\n\r\nFrom Malcolm\u2019s words she had scarcely gathered even a false meaning\r\n--not a glimmer of his nature--not even a suspicion that he meant\r\nsomething. To her he was but a handsome, brutal young groom. From the\r\nworld of thought and reasoning that lay behind his words, not an echo\r\nhad reached her.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt would be a great satisfaction to my old Adam to let him try her,\u201D\r\nsaid Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Bible again!\u201D said the lady to herself.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut it would be murder,\u201D he added, \u201Cnot knowing myself what experience\r\nhe has had.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI see,\u201D said the lady to herself; but loud enough for Malcolm to hear,\r\nfor her tender-heartedness had made her both angry and unjust, \u201Chis\r\nself-conceit is equal to his cruelty--just what I might have expected!\u201D\r\n\r\nWith the words she turned her horse\u2019s head and rode away, leaving a\r\nlump in Malcolm\u2019s throat.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wuss fowk\u201D--he still spoke in Scotch in his own chamber-- \u201Cwad du as\r\nthey\u2019re tell\u2019t, an\u2019 no jeedge ane anither. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s Kelpie\u2019s best\r\nchance o\u2019 salvation \u2019at I gang on wi\u2019 her. Stable-men wad ha\u2019e had her\r\nbrocken doon a\u2019thegither by this time; an\u2019 life wad ha\u2019e had little\r\nrelish left.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt added hugely to the bitterness of being thus rebuked, that he had\r\nnever in his life seen such a radiance of beauty\u2019s softest light as\r\nshone from the face and form of the reproving angel.-- \u201COnly she canna\r\nbe an angel,\u201D he said to himself; \u201Cor she wad ha\u2019e ken\u2019t better.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was young--not more than twenty, tall and graceful, with a touch\r\nof the matronly, which she must have had even in childhood, for it\r\nbelonged to her--so staid, so stately was she in all her grace. With\r\nher brown hair, her lily complexion, her blue-gray eyes, she was all\r\nof the moonlight and its shadows--even now, in the early morning, and\r\nangry. Her nose was so nearly perfect that one never thought of it.\r\nHer mouth was rather large, but had gained in value of shape, and in\r\nthe expression of indwelling sweetness, with every line that carried\r\nit beyond the measure of smallness. Most little mouths are pretty,\r\nsome even lovely, but not one have I seen beautiful. Her forehead was\r\nthe sweetest of half-moons. Of those who knew her best some absolutely\r\nbelieved that a radiance resembling moonlight shimmered from its\r\nprecious expanse.\r\n\r\n\u201CBe ye angry and sin not,\u201D had always been a puzzle to Malcolm, who\r\nhad, as I have said, inherited a certain Celtic fierceness; but now,\r\neven while he knew himself the object of the anger, he understood the\r\nword. It tried him sorely, however, that such gentleness and beauty\r\nshould be unreasonable. Could it be that he should never have a chance\r\nof convincing her how mistaken she was concerning his treatment of\r\nKelpie! What a celestial rosy red her face had glowed! and what summer\r\nlightnings had flashed up in her eyes, as if they had been the horizons\r\nof heavenly worlds up which flew the dreams that broke from the brain\r\nof a young sleeping goddess, to make the worlds glad also in the night\r\nof their slumber.\r\n\r\nSomething like this Malcolm felt: whoever saw her must feel as he had\r\nnever felt before. He gazed after her long and earnestly.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s an awfu\u2019 thing to ha\u2019e a wuman like that angert at ye!\u201D he said\r\nto himself when at length she had disappeared, \u201C--as bonny as she is\r\nangry! God be praised \u2019at he kens a\u2019thing, an\u2019 \u2019s no angert wi\u2019 ye for\r\nthe luik o\u2019 a thing! But the wheel may come roon\u2019 again--wha kens? Ony\r\ngait I s\u2019 mak the best o\u2019 Kelpie I can.-- I won\u2019er gien she kens Leddy\r\nFlorimel! She\u2019s a heap mair boontifu\u2019 like in her beauty nor her. The\r\nman micht haud \u2019s ain wi\u2019 an archangel \u2019at had a wuman like that to\r\nthe wife o\u2019 \u2019m.--Hoots! I\u2019ll be wussin\u2019 I had had anither upbringin\u2019,\r\n\u2019at I micht ha\u2019 won a step nearer to the hem o\u2019 her garment! an\u2019 that\r\nwad be to deny him \u2019at made an\u2019 ordeen\u2019t me. I wull not du that. But\r\nI maun hae a crack wi\u2019 Maister Graham, anent things twa or three,\r\njist to haud me straucht, for I\u2019m jist girnin\u2019 at bein\u2019 sae regairdit\r\nby sic a Revelation. Gien she had been an auld wife, I wad ha\u2019e only\r\nlauchen: what for \u2019s that? I doobt I\u2019m no muckle mair rizzonable nor\r\nhersel\u2019! The thing was this, I fancy it was sae clear she spak frae no\r\nill-natur\u2019, only frae pure humanity. She\u2019s a gran\u2019 ane yon, only some\r\nsaft, I doobt.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor the lady, she rode away sadly strengthened in her doubts whether\r\nthere could be a God in the world--not because there were in it such\r\nmen as she took Malcolm for, but because such a lovely animal had\r\nfallen into his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a sair thing to be misjeedged,\u201D said Malcolm to himself as he\r\nput the demoness in her stall; \u201Cbut it\u2019s no more than the Macker o\u2019 \u2019s\r\npits up wi\u2019 ilka hoor o\u2019 the day, an\u2019 says na a word. Eh, but God\u2019s\r\nunco quaiet! Sae lang as he kens till himsel\u2019 \u2019at he\u2019s a\u2019 richt, he\r\nlats fowk think \u2019at they like--till he has time to lat them ken better.\r\nLord, mak clean my hert within me, an\u2019 syne I\u2019ll care little for ony\r\njeedgement but thine.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely day, but Florimel would not ride: Malcolm must go at\r\nonce to Mr Lenorme; she would not go out again until she could have a\r\nchoice of horses to follow her.\r\n\r\n\u201CYour Kelpie is all very well in Richmond Park, and I wish I were able\r\nto ride her myself, Malcolm, but she will never do in London.\u201D\r\n\r\nHis name sounded sweet on her lips, but somehow to-day, for the first\r\ntime since he saw her first, he felt a strange sense of superiority in\r\nhis protection of her: could it be because he had that morning looked\r\nunto a higher orb of creation? It mattered little to Malcolm\u2019s generous\r\nnature that the voice that issued therefrom had been one of unjust\r\nrebuke.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho knows, my lady,\u201D he answered his mistress, \u201Cbut you may ride\r\nher some day! Give her a bit of sugar every time you see her-- on\r\nyour hand, so that she may take it with her lips, and not catch your\r\nfingers.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou shall show me how,\u201D said Florimel, and gave him a note for Mr\r\nLenorme.\r\n\r\nWhen he came in sight of the river, there, almost opposite the\r\npainter\u2019s house, lay his own little yacht! He thought of Kelpie in the\r\nstable, saw Psyche floating like a swan in the reach, made two or three\r\nlong strides, then sought to exhale the pride of life in thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nThe moment his arrival was announced to Lenorme, he came down and went\r\nwith him, and in an hour or two they had found very much the sort of\r\nhorse they wanted. Malcolm took him home for trial, and Florimel was\r\npleased with him. The earl\u2019s opinion was not to be had, for he had hurt\r\nhis shoulder when he fell from the rearing Kelpie the day before, and\r\nwas confined to his room in Curzon Street.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Malcolm put on his yachter\u2019s uniform, and set out\r\nagain for Chelsea. There he took a boat, and crossed the river to the\r\nyacht, which lay near the other side, in charge of an old salt whose\r\nacquaintance Blue Peter had made when lying below the bridges. On board\r\nhe found all tidy and ship-shape. He dived into the cabin, lighted a\r\ncandle, and made some measurements: all the little luxuries of the\r\nnest, carpets, cushions, curtains, and other things, were at Lossie\r\nHouse, having been removed when the Psyche was laid up for the winter:\r\nhe was going to replace them. And he was anxious to see whether he\r\ncould not fulfil a desire he had once heard Florimel express to her\r\nfather--that she had a bed on board, and could sleep there. He found\r\nit possible, and had soon contrived a berth: even a tiny stateroom was\r\nwithin the limits of construction.\r\n\r\nReturning to the deck, he was consulting Travers about a carpenter,\r\nwhen, to his astonishment, he saw young Davy, the boy he had brought\r\nfrom Duff Harbour, and whom he understood to have gone back with Blue\r\nPeter, gazing at him from before the mast.\r\n\r\n\u201CGien ye please, Maister MacPhail,\u201D said Davy, and said no more.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow on earth do _you_ come to be here, you rascal?\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\u201CPeter was to take you home with him!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI garred him think I was gauin\u2019,\u201D answered the boy, scratching his red\r\npoll, which glowed in the dusk.\r\n\r\n\u201CI gave him your wages,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, he tauld me that, but I loot them gang an\u2019 gae him the slip, an\u2019\r\nwas ashore close ahint yersel\u2019, sir, jist as the smack set sail. I\r\ncudna gang ohn hed a word wi\u2019 yersel\u2019, sir, to see whether ye wadna lat\r\nme bide wi\u2019 ye, sir. I haena muckle wut, they tell me, sir, but gien I\r\nmichtna aye be able to du what ye tell\u2019t me to du, I cud aye haud ohn\r\ndune what ye tell\u2019t me no to.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe words of the boy pleased Malcolm more than he judged it wise to\r\nmanifest. He looked hard at Davy. There was little to be seen in his\r\nface except the best and only thing--truth. It shone from his round\r\npale blue eyes; it conquered the self-assertion of his unhappy nose; it\r\nseemed to glow in every freckle of his sunburnt cheeks, as earnestly he\r\nreturned Malcolm\u2019s gaze.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut,\u201D said Malcolm, almost satisfied, \u201Chow is this, Travers? I never\r\ngave you any instructions about the boy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s where it is, sir,\u201D answered Travers. \u201CI seed the boy aboard\r\nbefore, and when he come aboard again, jest arter you left, I never as\r\nmuch as said to myself, It\u2019s all right. I axed him no questions, and he\r\ntold me no lies.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGien ye please, sir,\u201D struck in Davy, \u201CMaister Trahvers gied me my\r\nmait, an\u2019 I tuik it, \u2019cause I hed no sil\u2019er to buy ony: I houp it wasna\r\nstealin\u2019, sir. An\u2019 gien ye wad keep me, ye cud tak it aff o\u2019 my wauges\r\nfor three days.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLook here, Davy,\u201D said Malcolm, turning sharp upon him, \u201Ccan you swim?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy can I, sir,--weel that,\u201D answered Davy.\r\n\r\n\u201CJump overboard then, and swim ashore,\u201D said Malcolm, pointing to the\r\nChelsea bank.\r\n\r\nThe boy made two strides to the larboard gunwale, and would have been\r\nover the next instant, but Malcolm caught him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019ll do, Davy; I\u2019ll give you a chance, Davy,\u201D he said, \u201Cand if I\r\nget a good account of you from Travers, I\u2019ll rig you out like myself\r\nhere.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, sir,\u201D said Davy. \u201CI s\u2019 du what I can to please ye, sir. An\u2019\r\ngien ye wad sen\u2019 my wauges hame to my mither, sir, ye wad ken \u2019at I\r\ncudna be gauin\u2019 stravaguin\u2019, and drinkin\u2019 whan yer back was turn\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I\u2019ll write to your mother, and see what she says,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\u201CNow I want to tell you, both of you, that this yacht belongs to the\r\nMarchioness of Lossie, and I have the command of her, and I must have\r\neverything on board ship-shape, and as clean, Travers, as if she were\r\na seventy-four. If there\u2019s the head of a nail visible, it must be\r\nas bright as silver. And everything must be at the word. The least\r\nhesitation, and I have done with that man. If Davy here had grumbled\r\none mouthful, even on his way overboard, I wouldn\u2019t have kept him.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe then arranged that Travers was to go home that night, and bring with\r\nhim the next morning an old carpenter friend of his. He would himself\r\nbe down by seven o\u2019clock to set him to work.\r\n\r\nThe result was that, before a fortnight was over, he had the cabin\r\nthoroughly fitted up, with all the luxuries it had formerly possessed,\r\nand as many more as he could think of--to compensate for the loss of\r\nthe space occupied by the daintiest little stateroom --a very jewel box\r\nfor softness and richness and comfort. In the cabin, amongst the rest\r\nof his additions, he had fixed in a corner a set of tiny bookshelves,\r\nand filled them with what books he knew his sister liked, and some that\r\nhe liked for her. It was not probable she would read in them much, he\r\nsaid to himself, but they wouldn\u2019t make the boat heel, and who could\r\ntell when a drop of celestial nepenthe might ooze from one or another\r\nof them! So there they stood, in their lovely colours, of morocco,\r\nrussia, calf or vellum --types of the infinite rest in the midst of the\r\never restless-- the types for ever tossed, but the rest remaining.\r\n\r\nBy that time also he had arranged with Travers and Davy a code of\r\nsignals.\r\n\r\nThe day after Malcolm had his new hack, he rode him behind his mistress\r\nin the park, and nothing could be more decorous than the behaviour of\r\nboth horse and groom. It was early, and in Rotten Row, to his delight,\r\nthey met the lady of rebuke. She and Florimel pulled up simultaneously,\r\ngreeted, and had a little talk. When they parted, and the lady came to\r\npass Malcolm, whom she had not suspected, sitting a civilised horse\r\nin all serenity behind his mistress, she cast a quick second glance\r\nat him, and her fair face flushed with the red reflex of yesterday\u2019s\r\nanger. He expected her to turn at once and complain of him to her\r\nmistress, but to his disappointment, she rode on.\r\n\r\nWhen they left the park, Florimel went down Constitution Hill, and\r\nturning westward, rode to Chelsea. As they approached Mr Lenorme\u2019s\r\nhouse, she stopped and said to Malcolm--\r\n\r\n\u201CI am going to run in and thank Mr Lenorme for the trouble he has been\r\nat about the horse. Which is the house?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe pulled up at the gate. Malcolm dismounted, but before he could get\r\nnear to assist her, she was already halfway up the walk-- flying, and\r\nhe was but in time to catch the rein of Abbot, already moving off,\r\ncurious to know whether he was actually trusted alone. In about five\r\nminutes she came again, glancing about her all ways but behind, with a\r\nscared look, Malcolm thought. But she walked more slowly and statelily\r\nthan usual down the path. In a moment Malcolm had her in the saddle,\r\nand she cantered away--past the hospital into Sloane Street, and across\r\nthe park home. He said to himself, \u201CShe knows the way.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOLMASTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander Graham, the schoolmaster, was the son of a grieve, or\r\nfarm-overseer, in the North of Scotland. By straining every nerve,\r\nhis parents had succeeded in giving him a university education, the\r\nnarrowness of whose scope was possibly favourable to the development\r\nof what genius, rare and shy, might lurk among the students. He had\r\nlaboured well, and had gathered a good deal from books and lectures,\r\nbut far more from the mines they guided him to discover in his own\r\nnature. In common with so many Scotch parents, his had cherished the\r\nmost wretched as well as hopeless of all ambitions, seeing it presumes\r\nto work in a region into which _no_ ambition can enter--I mean that\r\nof seeing their son a clergyman. In presbyter, curate, bishop, or\r\ncardinal, ambition can fare but as that of the creeping thing to build\r\nits nest in the topmost boughs of the cedar. Worse than that; my simile\r\nis a poor one; for the moment a thought of ambition is _cherished_,\r\nthat moment the man is out of the kingdom. Their son with already a\r\nfew glimmering insights, which had not yet begun to interfere with\r\nhis acceptance of the doctrines of his church, made no opposition to\r\ntheir wish, but having qualified himself to the satisfaction of his\r\nsuperiors, at length ascended the pulpit to preach his first sermon.\r\n\r\nThe custom of the time as to preaching was a sort of compromise\r\nbetween reading a sermon and speaking extempore, a mode morally as\r\nwell as artistically false: the preacher learned his sermon by rote,\r\nand repeated it--as much like the man he therein was not, and as\r\nlittle like the parrot he was, as he could. It is no wonder, in such\r\nan attempt, either that memory should fail a shy man, or assurance\r\nan honest man. In Mr Graham\u2019s case it was probably the former:\r\nthe practice was universal, and he could hardly yet have begun to\r\nquestion it, so as to have had any conscience of evil. Blessedly,\r\nhowever, for his dawning truth and well-being, he failed --failed\r\nutterly--pitifully. His tongue clave to the roof of his mouth; his\r\nlips moved, but shaped no sound; a deathly dew bathed his forehead;\r\nhis knees shook; and he sank at last to the bottom of the chamber\r\nof his torture, whence, while his mother wept below, and his father\r\nclenched hands of despair beneath the tails of his Sunday coat, he\r\nwas half led, half dragged down the steps by the bedral, shrunken\r\ntogether like one caught in a shameful deed, and with the ghastly look\r\nof him who has but just revived from the faint supervening on the\r\nagonies of the rack. Home they crept together, speechless and hopeless\r\nall three, to be thenceforth the contempt and not the envy of their\r\nfellow-parishioners. For if the vulgar feeling towards the home-born\r\nprophet is superciliousness, what must the sentence upon failure be in\r\nungenerous natures, to which every downfall of another is an uplifting\r\nof themselves! But Mr Graham\u2019s worth had gained him friends in the\r\npresbytery, and he was that same week appointed to the vacant school of\r\nanother parish.\r\n\r\nThere it was not long before he made the acquaintance of Griselda\r\nCampbell, who was governess in the great house of the neighbourhood,\r\nand a love, not the less fine that it was hopeless from the first,\r\nsoon began to consume the chagrin of his failure, and substitute for\r\nit a more elevating sorrow;--for how could an embodied failure, to\r\noffer whose miserable self would be an insult, dare speak of love to\r\none before whom his whole being sank worshipping. Silence was the sole\r\narmour of his privilege. So long as he was silent, the terrible arrow\r\nwould never part from the bow of those sweet lips; he might love on,\r\nlove ever, nor be grudged the bliss of such visions as to him, seated\r\non its outer steps, might come from any chance opening of the heavenly\r\ngate. And Miss Campbell thought of him more kindly than he knew. But\r\nbefore long she accepted the offered situation of governess to Lady\r\nAnnabel, the only child of the late marquis\u2019s elder brother, at that\r\ntime himself marquis, and removed to Lossie House. There the late\r\nmarquis fell in love with her, and persuaded her to a secret marriage.\r\nThere also she became, in the absence of her husband, the mother of\r\nMalcolm. But the marquis of the time, jealous for the succession of his\r\ndaughter, and fearing his brother might yet marry the mother of his\r\nchild, contrived, with the assistance of the midwife, to remove the\r\ninfant and persuade the mother that he was dead, and also to persuade\r\nhis brother of the death of both mother and child; after which,\r\nimagining herself wilfully deserted by her husband, yet determined to\r\nendure shame rather than break the promise of secrecy she had given\r\nhim, the poor lady accepted the hospitality of her distant relative,\r\nMiss Horn, and continued with her till she died.\r\n\r\nWhen he learned where she had gone, Mr Graham seized a chance of\r\nchange to Portlossie that occurred soon after, and when she became her\r\ncousin\u2019s guest, went to see her, was kindly received, and for twenty\r\nyears lived in friendly relations with the two. It was not until after\r\nher death that he came to know the strange fact that the object of his\r\ncalm unalterable devotion had been a wife all those years, and was the\r\nmother of his favourite pupil. About the same time he was dismissed\r\nfrom the school on the charge of heretical teaching, founded on certain\r\nreligious conversations he had had with some of the fisher-people\r\nwho sought his advice; and thereupon he had left the place, and gone\r\nto London, knowing it would be next to impossible to find or gather\r\nanother school in Scotland after being thus branded. In London he\r\nhoped, one way or another, to avoid dying of cold or hunger, or in\r\ndebt: that was very nearly the limit of his earthly ambition.\r\n\r\nHe had just one acquaintance in the whole mighty city, and no more. Him\r\nhe had known in the days of his sojourn at King\u2019s College, where he\r\nhad grown with him from bejan to magistrand. He was the son of a linen\r\ndraper in Aberdeen, and was a decent, good humoured fellow, who, if he\r\nhad not distinguished, had never disgraced himself. His father, having\r\nsomewhat influential business relations, and finding in him no leanings\r\nto a profession, bespoke the good offices of a certain large retail\r\nhouse in London, and sent him thither to learn the business. The result\r\nwas that he had married a daughter of one of the partners, and become\r\na partner himself. His old friend wrote to him at his shop in Oxford\r\nStreet, and then went to see him at his house in Haverstock Hill.\r\n\r\nHe was shown into the library--in which were two mahogany cases with\r\nplate-glass doors, full of books, well cared for as to clothing and\r\ncondition, and perfectly placid, as if never disturbed from one week\u2019s\r\nend to another. In a minute Mr Marshal entered--so changed that he\r\ncould never have recognized him--still, however, a kind-hearted, genial\r\nman. He received his classfellow cordially and respectfully--referred\r\nmerrily to old times, and begged to know how he was getting on, asked\r\nwhether he had come to London with any special object, and invited\r\nhim to dine with them on Sunday. He accepted the invitation, met him,\r\naccording to agreement, at a certain chapel in Kentish Town, of which\r\nhe was a deacon, and walked home with him and his wife.\r\n\r\nThey had but one of their family at home--the youngest son, whom his\r\nfather was having educated for the dissenting ministry, in the full\r\nconviction that he was doing not a little for the truth, and justifying\r\nits cause before men, by devoting to its service the son of a man of\r\nstanding and worldly means, whom he might have easily placed in a\r\nposition to make money. The youth was of simple character and good\r\ninclination--ready to do what he saw to be right, but slow in putting\r\nto the question anything that interfered with his notions of laudable\r\nambition, or justifiable self-interest. He was attending lectures at a\r\ndissenting college in the neighbourhood, for his father feared Oxford\r\nor Cambridge, not for his morals, but his opinions in regard to church\r\nand state.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster spent a few days in the house. His friend was\r\ngenerally in town, and his wife, regarding him as very primitive and\r\nhardly fit for what she counted society--the class, namely, that she\r\nherself represented, was patronising and condescending; but the young\r\nfellow, finding, to his surprise, that he knew a great deal more about\r\nhis studies than he did himself, was first somewhat attracted and then\r\nsomewhat influenced by him, so that at length an intimacy tending to\r\nfriendship arose between them.\r\n\r\nMr Graham was not a little shocked to discover that his ideas in\r\nrespect of the preacher\u2019s calling were of a very worldly kind. The\r\nnotions of this fledgling of dissent differed from those of a clergyman\r\nof the same stamp in this:--the latter regards the church as a society\r\nwith accumulated property for the use of its officers; the former\r\nregarded it as a community of communities, each possessing a preaching\r\nhouse which ought to be made commercially successful. Saving influences\r\nmust emanate from it of course-- but dissenting saving influences.\r\n\r\nHis mother was a partisan to a hideous extent. To hear her talk you\r\nwould have thought she imagined the apostles the first dissenters,\r\nand that the main duty of every Christian soul was to battle for\r\nthe victory of Congregationalism over Episcopacy, and Voluntaryism\r\nover State Endowment. Her every mode of thinking and acting was of\r\na levelling common-place. With her, love was liking, duty something\r\nunpleasant--generally to other people, and kindness patronage. But she\r\nwas just in money-matters, and her son too had every intention of being\r\nworthy of his hire, though wherein lay the value of the labour with\r\nwhich he thought to counterpoise that hire, it were hard to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE PREACHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sermon Mr Graham heard at the chapel that Sunday morning in\r\nKentish Town was not of an elevating, therefore not of a strengthening\r\ndescription. The pulpit was at that time in offer to the highest\r\nbidder--in orthodoxy, that is, combined with popular talent. The first\r\nobject of the chapel\u2019s existence--I do not say in the minds of those\r\nwho built it, for it was an old place, but certainly in the minds\r\nof those who now directed its affairs--was not to save its present\r\ncongregation, but to gather a larger--ultimately that they might be\r\nsaved, let us hope, but primarily that the drain upon the purses of\r\nthose who were responsible for its rent and other outlays, might be\r\nlessened. Mr Masquar, therefore, to whom the post was a desirable\r\none, had been mainly anxious that morning to prove his orthodoxy, and\r\nso commend his services. Not that in those days one heard so much of\r\nthe dangers of heterodoxy: that monster was as yet but growling far\r\noff in the jungles of Germany; but certain whispers had been abroad\r\nconcerning the preacher which he thought desirable to hush, especially\r\nas they were founded in truth. He had tested the power of heterodoxy to\r\nattract attention, but having found that the attention it did attract\r\nwas not of a kind favourable to his wishes, had so skilfully remodelled\r\nhis theories that, although to his former friends he declared them in\r\nsubstance unaltered, it was impossible any longer to distinguish them\r\nfrom the most uncompromising orthodoxy; and his sermon of that morning\r\nhad tended neither to the love of God, the love of man, nor a hungering\r\nafter righteousness--its aim being to disprove the reported heterodoxy\r\nof Jacob Masquar.\r\n\r\nAs they walked home, Mrs Marshal, addressing her husband in a tone of\r\nconjugal disapproval, said, with more force than delicacy,\r\n\r\n\u201CThe pulpit is not the place to give a man to wash his dirty linen in.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, you see, my love,\u201D answered her husband in a tone of apology,\r\n\u201Cpeople won\u2019t submit to be told their duty by mere students, and just\r\nat present there seems nobody else to be had. There\u2019s none in the\r\nmarket but old stagers and young colts--eh, Fred? But Mr Masquar is at\r\nleast a man of experience.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf more than enough, perhaps,\u201D suggested his wife. \u201CAnd the young ones\r\nmust have their chance, else how are they to learn? You should have\r\ngiven the principal a hint. It is a most desirable thing that Frederick\r\nshould preach a little oftener.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey have it in turn, and it wouldn\u2019t do to favour one more than\r\nanother.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe could hand his guinea, or whatever they gave him, to the one whose\r\nturn it ought to have been, and that would set it all right.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this point the silk-mercer, fearing that the dominie, as he called\r\nhim, was silently disapproving, and willing therefore to change the\r\nsubject, turned to him and said,\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy shouldn\u2019t _you_ give us a sermon, Graham?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you never hear,\u201D he said, \u201Chow I fell like Dagon on the threshold\r\nof the church, and have lain there ever since.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat has that to do with it?\u201D returned his friend, sorry that his\r\nforgetfulness should have caused a painful recollection. \u201CThat is\r\nages ago, when you were little more than a boy. Seriously,\u201D he added,\r\nchiefly to cover his little indiscretion, \u201Cwill you preach for us the\r\nSunday after next?\u201D\r\n\r\nDeacons generally ask a man to preach _for_ them.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Mr Graham.\r\n\r\nBut even as he said it, a something began to move in his heart--\r\na something half of jealousy for God, half of pity for poor souls\r\nbuffeted by such winds as had that morning been roaring, chaff-laden,\r\nabout the church, while the grain fell all to the bottom of the pulpit.\r\nSomething burned in him: was it the word that was as a fire in his\r\nbones, or was it a mere lust of talk? He thought for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you any gatherings between Sundays?\u201D he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; every Wednesday evening,\u201D replied Mr Marshal. \u201CAnd if you won\u2019t\r\npreach on Sunday, we shall announce to-night that next Wednesday a\r\nclergyman of the Church of Scotland will address the prayer meeting.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe was glad to get out of it so, for he was uneasy about his friend,\r\nboth as to his nerve, which might fail him, and his Scotch oddities,\r\nwhich would not.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat would be hardly true,\u201D said Mr Graham, \u201Cseeing I never got beyond\r\na licence.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNobody here knows the difference between a licentiate and a placed\r\nminister; and if they did they would not care a straw. So we\u2019ll just\r\nsay _clergyman_.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I won\u2019t have it announced in any terms. Leave that alone, and I\r\nwill try to speak at the prayer meeting.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt won\u2019t be in the least worth your while except we announce it. You\r\nwon\u2019t have a soul to hear you but the pew-openers, the woman that\r\ncleans the chapel, Mrs Marshal\u2019s washerwoman, and the old greengrocer\r\nwe buy our vegetables from. We must really announce it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen I won\u2019t do it. Just tell me--what would our Lord have said to\r\nPeter or John if they had told Him that they had been to synagogue\r\nand had been asked to speak, but had declined because there were only\r\nthe pew-openers, the chapel-cleaner, a washerwoman, and a greengrocer\r\npresent?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI said it only for your sake, Graham; you needn\u2019t take me up so\r\nsharply.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd ra-a-ther irreverently--don\u2019t you think--excuse me, sir?\u201D said Mrs\r\nMarshal very softly. But the very softness had a kind of jelly-fish\r\nsting in it.\r\n\r\n\u201CI think,\u201D rejoined the schoolmaster, indirectly replying, \u201Cwe must be\r\ncareful to show our reverence in a manner pleasing to our Lord. Now I\r\ncannot discover that he cares for any reverences but the shaping of our\r\nways after his; and if you will show me a single instance of respect of\r\npersons in our Lord, I will press my petition no farther to be allowed\r\nto speak a word to your pew-openers, washerwoman, and greengrocer.\u201D\r\n\r\nHis entertainers were silent--the gentleman in the consciousness of\r\ndeserved rebuke, the lady in offence.\r\n\r\nJust then the latter bethought herself that their guest, belonging to\r\nthe Scotch Church, was, if no Episcopalian, yet no dissenter, and that\r\nseemed to clear up to her the spirit of his disapproval.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy all means, Mr Marshal,\u201D she said, \u201Clet your friend speak on the\r\nWednesday evening. It would not be to his advantage to have it said\r\nthat he occupied a dissenting pulpit. It will not be nearly such\r\nan exertion either; and if he is unaccustomed to speak to large\r\ncongregations, he will find himself more comfortable with our usual\r\nweek-evening one.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have never attempted to speak in public but once,\u201D rejoined Mr\r\nGraham, \u201Cand then I failed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! that accounts for it,\u201D said his friend\u2019s wife, and the simplicity\r\nof his confession, while it proved him a simpleton, mollified her.\r\n\r\nThus it came that he spent the days between Sunday and Thursday in\r\ntheir house, and so made the acquaintance of young Marshal.\r\n\r\nWhen his mother perceived their growing intimacy, she warned her son\r\nthat their visitor belonged to an unscriptural and worldly community,\r\nand that notwithstanding his apparent guilelessness-- deficiency\r\nindeed--he might yet use cunning arguments to draw him aside from the\r\nfaith of his fathers. But the youth replied that, although in the\r\nfirmness of his own position as a Congregationalist, he had tried to\r\nget the Scotchman into a conversation upon church government, he had\r\nfailed; the man smiled queerly and said nothing. But when a question of\r\nNew Testament criticism arose, he came awake at once, and his little\r\nblue eyes gleamed like glow-worms.\r\n\r\n\u201CTake care, Frederick,\u201D said his mother. \u201CThe Scriptures are not to be\r\ntreated like common books and subjected to human criticism.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe must find out what they mean, I suppose, mother,\u201D said the youth.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re to take just the plain meaning that he that runneth may\r\nread,\u201D answered his mother.--\u201CMore than that no one has any business\r\nwith. You\u2019ve got to save your own soul first, and then the souls of\r\nyour neighbours if they will let you; and for that reason you must\r\ncultivate, not a spirit of criticism, but the talents that attract\r\npeople to the hearing of the Word. You have got a fine voice, and it\r\nwill improve with judicious use. Your father is now on the outlook for\r\na teacher of elocution to instruct you how to make the best of it, and\r\nspeak with power on God\u2019s behalf.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen the afternoon of Wednesday began to draw towards the evening,\r\nthere came on a mist, not a London fog, but a low wet cloud, which\r\nkept slowly condensing into rain; and as the hour of meeting drew nigh\r\nwith the darkness, it grew worse. Mrs Marshal had forgotten all about\r\nthe meeting and the schoolmaster: her husband was late, and she wanted\r\nher dinner. At twenty minutes past six, she came upon her guest in the\r\nhall, kneeling on the door-mat, first on one knee, then on the other,\r\nturning up the feet of his trousers.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, Mr Graham,\u201D she said kindly, as he rose and proceeded to look for\r\nhis cotton umbrella, easily discernible in the stand among the silk\r\nones of the house, \u201Cyou\u2019re never going out on a night like this?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am going to the prayer-meeting, ma\u2019am,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CNonsense! You\u2019ll be wet to the skin before you get half way.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI promised, you may remember, ma\u2019am, to talk a little to them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou only said so to my husband. You may be very glad, seeing it has\r\nturned out so wet, that I would not allow him to have it announced\r\nfrom the pulpit. There is not the slightest occasion for your going.\r\nBesides, you have not had your dinner.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s not of the slightest consequence, ma\u2019am. A bit of bread and\r\ncheese before I go to bed is all I need to sustain nature, and fit me\r\nfor understanding my proposition in Euclid. I have been in the habit,\r\nfor the last few years, of reading one every night before I go to bed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe dissenters consider a chapter of the Bible the best thing to read\r\nbefore going to bed,\u201D said the lady, with a sustained voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CI keep that for the noontide of my perceptions--for mental high\r\nwater,\u201D said the schoolmaster. \u201CEuclid is good enough after supper. Not\r\nthat I deny myself a small portion of the Word,\u201D he added with a smile,\r\nas he proceeded to open the door--\u201Cwhen I feel very hungry for it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is no one expecting you,\u201D persisted the lady, who could ill\r\nendure not to have her own way, even when she did not care for the\r\nmatter concerned. \u201CWho will be the wiser or the worse if you stay at\r\nhome?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy dear lady,\u201D returned the schoolmaster, \u201Cwhen I have on good grounds\r\nmade up my mind to a thing, I always feel as if I had promised God to\r\ndo it; and indeed it amounts to the same thing very nearly. Such a\r\nresolve then is not to be unmade except on equally good grounds with\r\nthose upon which it was made. Having resolved to try whether I could\r\nnot draw a little water of refreshment for souls which if not thirsting\r\nare but fainting the more, shall I allow a few drops of rain to prevent\r\nme?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPray don\u2019t let me persuade you against your will,\u201D said his hostess,\r\nwith a stately bend of her neck over her shoulder, as she turned into\r\nthe drawing-room.\r\n\r\nHer guest went out into the rain, asking himself by what theory of the\r\nwill his hostess could justify such a phrase---too simple to see that\r\nshe had only thrown it out, as the cuttlefish its ink, to cover her\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nBut the weather had got a little into his brain: into his soul it was\r\nseldom allowed to intrude. He felt depressed and feeble and dull. But\r\nat the first corner he turned, he met a little breath of wind. It blew\r\nthe rain in his face, and revived him a little, reminding him at the\r\nsame time that he had not yet opened his umbrella. As he put it up he\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\u201CHere I am,\u201D he said to himself, \u201Clance in hand, spurring to meet my\r\ndragon!\u201D\r\n\r\nOnce when he used a similar expression, Malcolm had asked him what he\r\nmeant by his dragon; \u201CI mean,\u201D replied the schoolmaster, \u201Cthat huge\r\nslug, _The Commonplace_. It is the wearifulest dragon to fight in the\r\nwhole miscreation. Wound it as you may, the jelly-mass of the monster\r\ncloses, and the dull one is himself again--feeding all the time so\r\ncunningly that scarce one of the victims whom he has swallowed suspects\r\nthat he is but pabulum slowly digesting in the belly of the monster.\u201D\r\n\r\nIf the schoolmaster\u2019s dragon, spread abroad as he lies, a vague\r\ndilution, everywhere throughout human haunts, has yet any\r\n_head_-quarters, where else can they be than in such places as that to\r\nwhich he was now making his way to fight him? What can be fuller of the\r\nwearisome, depressing, beauty-blasting commonplace than a dissenting\r\nchapel in London, on the night of the weekly prayer meeting, and\r\nthat night a drizzly one? The few lights fill the lower part with a\r\ndull, yellow, steamy glare, while the vast galleries, possessed by an\r\nugly twilight, yawn above like the dreary openings of a disconsolate\r\neternity. The pulpit rises into the dim damp air, covered with brown\r\nholland, reminding one of desertion and charwomen, if not of a chamber\r\nof death and spiritual undertakers, who have shrouded and coffined the\r\ntruth. Gaping, empty, unsightly, the place is the very skull of the\r\nmonster himself--the fittest place of all wherein to encounter the\r\ngreat slug, and deal him one of those death blows which every sunrise,\r\nevery repentance, every child-birth, every true love deals him. Every\r\nhour he receives the blow that kills, but he takes long to die, for\r\nevery hour he is right carefully fed and cherished by a whole army of\r\npurveyors, including every trade and profession, but officered chiefly\r\nby divines and men of science.\r\n\r\nWhen the dominie entered, all was still, and every light had a nimbus\r\nof illuminated vapour. There were hardly more than three present beyond\r\nthe number Mr Marshal had given him to expect; and their faces, some\r\ngrim, some grimy, most of them troubled, and none blissful, seemed\r\nthe nervous ganglions of the monster whose faintly gelatinous bulk\r\nfilled the place. He seated himself in a pew near the pulpit, communed\r\nwith his own heart and was still. Presently the ministering deacon,\r\na humbler one in the worldly sense than Mr Marshal, for he kept a\r\nsmall ironmongery shop in the next street to the chapel, entered,\r\ntwirling the wet from his umbrella as he came along one of the passages\r\nintersecting the pews. Stepping up into the desk which cowered humbly\r\nat the foot of the pulpit, he stood erect, and cast his eyes around the\r\nsmall assembly. Discovering there no one that could lead in singing, he\r\nchose out and read one of the monster\u2019s favourite hymns, in which never\r\na sparkle of thought or a glow of worship gave reason wherefore the\r\nholy words should have been carpentered together. Then he prayed aloud,\r\nand then first the monster found tongue, voice, articulation. If this\r\nwas worship, surely it was the monster\u2019s own worship of itself! No God\r\nwere better than one to whom such were fitting words of prayer. What\r\npassed in the man\u2019s soul, God forbid I should judge: I speak but of the\r\nwords that reached the ears of men.\r\n\r\nAnd over all the vast of London lay the monster, filling it like the\r\nnight--not in churches and chapels only--in almost all theatres, and\r\nmost houses--most of all in rich houses: everywhere he had a foot, a\r\ntail, a tentacle or two--everywhere suckers that drew the life-blood\r\nfrom the sickening and somnolent soul.\r\n\r\nWhen the deacon, a little brown man, about five-and-thirty, had ended\r\nhis prayer, he read another hymn of the same sort--one of such as form\r\nthe bulk of most collections, and then looked meaningly at Mr Graham,\r\nwhom he had seen in the chapel on Sunday with his brother deacon,\r\nand therefore judged one of consequence, who had come to the meeting\r\nwith an object, and ought to be propitiated: he had intended speaking\r\nhimself. After having thus for a moment regarded him,\r\n\r\n\u201CWould you favour us with a word of exhortation, sir?\u201D he said, in a\r\nstage-like whisper.\r\n\r\nNow the monster had by this time insinuated a hair-like sucker into\r\nthe heart of the schoolmaster, and was busy. But at the word, as the\r\nRed-Cross Knight when he heard Orgoglio in the wood staggered to meet\r\nhim, he rose at once, and although his umbrella slipped and fell with\r\na loud discomposing clatter, calmly approached the reading desk. To\r\nlook at his outer man, this knight of the truth might have been the\r\nvery high priest of the monster which, while he was sitting there, had\r\nbeen twisting his slimy, semi-electric, benumbing tendrils around his\r\nheart. His business was nevertheless to fight him, though to fight him\r\nin his own heart and that of other people at one and the same moment,\r\nhe might well find hard work. And the loathly worm had this advantage\r\nover the knight, that it was the first time he had stood up to speak in\r\npublic since his failure thirty years ago. That hour again for a moment\r\novershadowed his spirit. It was a wavy harvest morning in a village of\r\nthe north. A golden wind was blowing, and little white clouds flying\r\naloft in the sunny blue. The church was full of well-known faces,\r\nupturned, listening, expectant, critical. The hour vanished in a slow\r\nmist of abject misery and shame. But had he not learned to rejoice over\r\nall dead hopes, and write _Te Deums_ on their coffin-lids? And now he\r\nstood in dim light, in the vapour from damp garments, in dinginess and\r\nugliness, with a sense of spiritual squalor and destitution in his very\r\nsoul. He had tried to pray his own prayer while the deacon prayed his;\r\nbut there had come to him no reviving--no message for this handful of\r\ndull souls--there were nine of them in all --and his own soul crouched\r\nhard and dull within his bosom. How to give them one deeper breath? How\r\nto make them know they were alive? Whence was his aid to come?\r\n\r\nHis aid was nearer than he knew. There were no hills to which he could\r\nlift his eyes, but help may hide in the valley as well as come down\r\nfrom the mountain, and he found his under the coal-scuttle bonnet of\r\nthe woman that swept out and dusted the chapel. She was no interesting\r\nyoung widow. A life of labour and vanished children lay behind as well\r\nas before her. She was sixty years of age, seamed with the small-pox,\r\nand in every seam the dust and smoke of London had left a stain. She\r\nhad a troubled eye, and a gaze that seemed to ask of the universe\r\nwhy it had given birth to her. But it was only her face that asked\r\nthe question; her mind was too busy with the ever recurring enigma,\r\nwhich, answered this week, was still an enigma for the next--how she\r\nwas to pay her rent--too busy to have any other question to ask. Or\r\nwould she not rather have gone to sleep altogether, under the dreary\r\nfascination of the slug monster, had she not had a severe landlady,\r\nwho _would_ be paid punctually, or turn her out? Anyhow, every time\r\nand all the time she sat in the chapel, she was brooding over ways\r\nand means, calculating pence and shillings--the day\u2019s charing she had\r\npromised her, and the chances of more--mingling faint regrets over past\r\nindulgences --the extra half-pint of beer she drank on Saturday--the\r\nbit of cheese she bought on Monday. Of this face of care, revealing a\r\nspirit which Satan had bound, the schoolmaster caught sight,-- caught\r\nfrom its commonness, its grimness, its defeature, inspiration and\r\nuplifting, for there he beheld the oppressed, down-trodden, mire-fouled\r\nhumanity which the man in whom he believed had loved because it was\r\nhis father\u2019s humanity divided into brothers, and had died straining to\r\nlift back to the bosom of that Father. Oh tale of horror and dreary\r\nmonstrosity, if it be such indeed as the bulk of its priests on the one\r\nhand, and its enemies on the other represent it! Oh story of splendrous\r\nfate, of infinite resurrection and uplifting, of sun and breeze, of\r\norgan-blasts and exultation, for the heart of every man and woman,\r\nwhatsoever the bitterness of its care or the weight of its care, if it\r\nbe such as the Book itself has held it from age to age!\r\n\r\nIt was the mere humanity of the woman, I say, and nothing in her\r\nindividuality of what is commonly called the interesting, that\r\nministered to the breaking of the schoolmaster\u2019s trance. \u201C_Oh ye of\r\nlittle faith!_\u201D were the first words that flew from his lips--he knew\r\nnot whether uttered concerning himself or the charwoman the more; and\r\nat once he fell to speaking of him who said the words, and of the\r\npeople that came to him and heard him gladly;--how this one, whom he\r\ndescribed, must have felt, _Oh, if that be true!_ how that one, whom\r\nalso he described, must have said, _Now he means me!_ and so laid bare\r\nthe secrets of many hearts, until he had concluded all in the misery of\r\nbeing without a helper in the world, a prey to fear and selfishness and\r\ndismay. Then he told them how the Lord pledged himself for all their\r\nneeds--meat and drink and clothes for the body, and God and love and\r\ntruth for the soul, if only they would put them in the right order and\r\nseek the best first.\r\n\r\nNext he spoke a parable to them--of a house and a father and his\r\nchildren. The children would not do what their father told them, and\r\ntherefore began to keep out of his sight. After a while they began to\r\nsay to each other that he must have gone out, it was so long since they\r\nhad seen him--only they never went to look. And again after a time some\r\nof them began to say to each other that they did not believe they had\r\never had any father. But there were some who dared not say that--who\r\nthought they had a father somewhere in the house, and yet crept about\r\nin misery, sometimes hungry and often cold, fancying he was not\r\nfriendly to them, when all the time it was they who were not friendly\r\nto him, and said to themselves he would not give them anything. They\r\nnever went to knock at his door, or call to know if he were inside and\r\nwould speak to them. And all the time there he was sitting sorrowful,\r\nlistening and listening for some little hand to come knocking, and some\r\nlittle voice to come gently calling through the key-hole; for sorely\r\ndid he long to take them to his bosom and give them everything. Only\r\nif he did that without their coming to him, they would not care for\r\nhis love or him, would only care for the things he gave them, and soon\r\nwould come to hate their brothers and sisters, and turn their own souls\r\ninto hells, and the earth into a charnel of murder.\r\n\r\nEre he ended he was pleading with the charwoman to seek her father in\r\nhis own room, tell him her troubles, do what he told her, and fear\r\nnothing. And while he spoke, lo! the dragon-slug had vanished; the\r\nugly chapel was no longer the den of the hideous monster; it was but\r\nthe dusky bottom of a glory shaft, adown which gazed the stars of the\r\ncoming resurrection.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe whole trouble is that we won\u2019t let God help us,\u201D said the\r\npreacher, and sat down.\r\n\r\nA prayer from the greengrocer followed, in which he did seem to be\r\nfeeling after God a little; and then the ironmonger pronounced the\r\nbenediction, and all went--among the rest, Frederick Marshal, who\r\nhad followed the schoolmaster, and now walked back with him to his\r\nfather\u2019s, where he was to spend one night more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorimel had found her daring visit to Lenorme stranger and more\r\nfearful than she had expected: her courage was not quite so masterful\r\nas she had thought. The next day she got Mrs Barnardiston to meet her\r\nat the studio. But she contrived to be there first by some minutes,\r\nand her friend found her seated, and the painter looking as if he had\r\nfairly begun his morning\u2019s work. When she apologised for being late,\r\nFlorimel said she supposed her groom had brought round the horses\r\nbefore his time; being ready, she had not looked at her watch. She was\r\nsharp on other people for telling stories --but had of late ceased to\r\nsee any great harm in telling one to protect herself. The fact however\r\nhad begun to present itself in those awful morning hours that seem a\r\nmingling of time and eternity, and she did not like the discovery that,\r\nsince her intimacy with Lenorme, she had begun to tell lies: what would\r\nhe say if he knew?\r\n\r\nMalcolm found it dreary waiting in the street while she sat to the\r\npainter. He would not have minded it on Kelpie, for she was always\r\noccupation enough, but with only a couple of quiet horses to hold, it\r\nwas dreary. He took to scrutinizing the faces that passed him, trying\r\nto understand them. To his surprise he found that almost everyone\r\nreminded him of somebody he had known before, though he could not\r\nalways identify the likeness.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure to see his yacht lying so near him, and Davy on the\r\ndeck, and to hear the blows of the hammer and the _swish_ of the plane\r\nas the carpenter went on with the alterations to which he had set\r\nhim, but he got tired of sharing in activity only with his ears and\r\neyes. One thing he had by it, however, and that was--a good lesson in\r\nquiescent waiting--a grand thing for any man, and most of all for those\r\nin whom the active is strong.\r\n\r\nThe next day Florimel did not ride until after lunch, but took her maid\r\nwith her to the studio, and Malcolm had a long morning with Kelpie.\r\nOnce again he passed the beautiful lady in Rotten Row, but Kelpie was\r\nbehaving in a most exemplary manner, and he could not tell whether\r\nshe even saw him. I believe she thought her lecture had done him\r\ngood. The day after that Lord Liftore was able to ride, and for some\r\ndays Florimel and he rode in the park before dinner, when, as Malcolm\r\nfollowed on the new horse, he had to see his lordship make love to his\r\nsister, without being able to find the least colourable pretext of\r\ninvoluntary interference.\r\n\r\nAt length the parcel he had sent for from Lossie House arrived. He had\r\nexplained to Mrs Courthope what he wanted the things for, and she had\r\nmade no difficulty of sending them to the address he gave her. Lenorme\r\nhad already begun the portrait, had indeed been working at it very\r\nbusily, and was now quite ready for him to sit. The early morning being\r\nthe only time a groom could contrive to spare--and that involved yet\r\nearlier attention to his horses, they arranged that Malcolm should be\r\nat the study every day by seven o\u2019clock, until the painter\u2019s object was\r\ngained. So he mounted Kelpie at half-past six of a fine breezy spring\r\nmorning, rode across Hyde Park and down Grosvenor Place, and so reached\r\nChelsea, where he put up his mare in Lenorme\u2019s stable--fortunately\r\nlarge enough to admit of an empty stall between her and the painter\u2019s\r\ngrand screw, else a battle frightful to relate might have fallen to my\r\nlot.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more to Malcolm\u2019s mind than such a surpassing\r\nopportunity of learning with assurance what sort of man Lenorme was;\r\nand the relation that arose between them extended the sittings far\r\nbeyond the number necessary for the object proposed. How the first of\r\nthem passed I must recount with some detail.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he arrived, he was shown into the painter\u2019s bedroom, where\r\nlay the portmanteau he had carried thither himself the night before:\r\nout of it, with a strange mingling of pleasure and sadness, he now\r\ntook the garments of his father\u2019s vanished state--the filibeg of the\r\ndark tartan of his clan, in which green predominated; the French coat\r\nof black velvet of Genoa, with silver buttons; the bonnet, which ought\r\nto have had an eagle\u2019s feather, but had only an aigrette of diamonds;\r\nthe black sporran of long goat\u2019s hair, with the silver clasp; the\r\nsilver-mounted dirk, with its appendages, set all with pale cairngorms\r\nnearly as good as oriental topazes; and the claymore of the renowned\r\nAndrew\u2019s forging, with its basket hilt of silver, and its black,\r\nsilver-mounted sheath. He handled each with the reverence of a son.\r\nHaving dressed in them, he drew himself up with not a little of the\r\nCelt\u2019s pleasure in fine clothes, and walked into the painting-room.\r\nLenorme started with admiration of his figure, and wonder at the\r\ndignity of his carriage, while, mingled with these feelings, he was\r\naware of an indescribable doubt, something to which he could give no\r\nname. He almost sprang at his palette and brushes: whether he succeeded\r\nwith the likeness of the late marquis or not, it would be his own fault\r\nif he did not make a good picture! He painted eagerly, and they talked\r\nlittle, and only about things indifferent.\r\n\r\nAt length the painter said,\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you. Now walk about the room while I spread a spadeful of paint:\r\nyou must be tired standing.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm did as he was told, and walked straight up to the Temple of\r\nIsis, in which the painter had now long been at work on the goddess. He\r\nrecognised his sister at once, but a sudden pinch of prudence checked\r\nthe exclamation that had almost burst from his lips.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a beautiful picture!\u201D he said. \u201CWhat does it mean?-- Surely it is\r\nHermione coming to life, and Leontes dying of joy! But no; that would\r\nnot fit. They are both too young, and----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou read Shakspere, I see,\u201D said Lenorme, \u201Cas well as Epictetus.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do--a good deal,\u201D answered Malcolm. \u201CBut please tell me what you\r\npainted this for.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Lenorme told him the parable of Novalis, and Malcolm saw what the\r\npoet meant. He stood staring at the picture, and Lenorme sat working\r\naway, but a little anxious--he hardly knew why: had he bethought\r\nhimself he would have put the picture out of sight before Malcolm came.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou wouldn\u2019t be offended if I made a remark, would you, Mr Lenorme?\u201D\r\nsaid Malcolm at length.\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly not,\u201D replied Lenorme, something afraid nevertheless of what\r\nmight be coming.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know whether I can express what I mean,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cbut\r\nI\u2019ll try. I could do it better in Scotch, I believe, but then you\r\nwouldn\u2019t understand me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI think I should,\u201D said Lenorme. \u201CI spent six months in Edinburgh\r\nonce.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COw ay! but ye see they dinna thraw the words there jist the same gait\r\nthey du at Portlossie. Na, na! I maunna attemp\u2019 it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHold, hold!\u201D cried Lenorme. \u201CI want to have your criticism. I don\u2019t\r\nunderstand a word you are saying. You must make the best you can of the\r\nEnglish.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI was only telling you in Scotch that I wouldn\u2019t try the Scotch,\u201D\r\nreturned Malcolm. \u201CNow I will try the English.--In the first place,\r\nthen--but really it\u2019s very presumptuous of me, Mr Lenorme; and it may\r\nbe that I am blind to something in the picture.----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGo on,\u201D said Lenorme impatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t you think then, that one of the first things you would look for\r\nin a goddess would be--what shall I call it?--an air of mystery?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat was so much involved in the very idea of Isis, in her especially,\r\nthat they said she was always veiled, and no man had ever seen her\r\nface.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat would greatly interfere with my notion of mystery,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\u201CThere must be revelation before mystery. I take it that mystery is\r\nwhat lies behind revelation; that which as yet revelation has not\r\nreached. You must see something--a part of something, before you can\r\nfeel any sense of mystery about it. The Isis for ever veiled is the\r\nabsolutely Unknown, not the Mysterious.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut, you observe, the idea of the parable is different. According to\r\nthat, Isis is for ever unveiling, that is, revealing herself, in her\r\nworks, chiefly in the women she creates, and then chiefly in each of\r\nthem to the man who loves her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI see what you mean well enough; but not the less she remains the\r\ngoddess, does she not?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSurely she does.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd can a goddess ever reveal all she is and has?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen ought there not to be mystery about the face and form of your\r\nIsis on her pedestal?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs it not there? Is there not mystery in the face and form of every\r\nwoman that walks the earth?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDoubtless; but you desire--do you not?--to show--that although this is\r\nthe very lady the young man loved before ever he sought the shrine of\r\nthe goddess, not the less is she the goddess Isis herself?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do--or at least I ought; only--by Jove! you have already looked\r\ndeeper into the whole thing than I!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere may be things to account for that on both sides,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\u201CBut one word more to relieve my brain:--if you would embody the full\r\nmeaning of the parable, you must not be content that the mystery is\r\nthere; you must show in your painting that you feel it there; you must\r\npaint the invisible veil that no hand can lift, for there it is, and\r\nthere it ever will be, though Isis herself raise it from morning to\r\nmorning.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow am I to do that?\u201D said Lenorme, not that he did not see what\r\nMalcolm meant, or agree with it: he wanted to make him talk.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow can I, who never drew a stroke, or painted anything but the gunnel\r\nof a boat, tell you that?\u201D rejoined Malcolm. \u201CIt is your business. You\r\nmust paint that veil, that mystery in the forehead, and in the eyes,\r\nand in the lips--yes, in the cheeks and the chin and the eyebrows and\r\neverywhere. You must make her say without saying it, that she knows oh!\r\nso much, if only she could make you understand it!--that she is all\r\nthere for you, but the all is infinitely more than you can know. As she\r\nstands there now,----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI must interrupt you,\u201D cried Lenorme, \u201Cjust to say that the picture is\r\nnot finished yet.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd yet I will finish my sentence, if you will allow me,\u201D returned\r\nMalcolm. \u201C--As she stands there--the goddess--she looks only a\r\nbeautiful young woman, with whom the young man spreading out his arms\r\nto her is very absolutely in love. There is the glow and the mystery of\r\nlove in both their faces, and nothing more.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd is not that enough?\u201D said Lenorme.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D answered Malcolm. \u201CAnd yet it may be too much,\u201D he added, \u201Cif you\r\nare going to hang it up where people will see it.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he said this, he looked hard at the painter for a moment. The dark\r\nhue of Lenorme\u2019s cheek deepened; his brows lowered a little farther\r\nover the black wells of his eyes; and he painted on without answer.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy Jove!\u201D he said at length.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t swear, Mr Lenorme,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201C--Besides, that\u2019s my Lord\r\nLiftore\u2019s oath.--If _you_ do, you will teach my lady to swear.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you mean by that?\u201D asked Lenorme, with offence plain enough in\r\nhis tone.\r\n\r\nThereupon Malcolm told him how on one occasion, himself being present,\r\nthe marquis her father happening to utter an imprecation, Lady Florimel\r\ntook the first possible opportunity of using the very same words\r\non her own account, much to the marquis\u2019s amusement and Malcolm\u2019s\r\nastonishment. But upon reflection he had come to see that she only\r\nwanted to cure her father of the bad habit.\r\n\r\nThe painter laughed heartily, but stopped all at once and said, \u201CIt\u2019s\r\nenough to make any fellow swear though, to hear a--groom talk as you do\r\nabout art.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave I the impudence? I didn\u2019t know it,\u201D said Malcolm, with some\r\ndismay. \u201CI seemed to myself merely saying the obvious thing, the common\r\nsense, about the picture, on the ground of your own statement of your\r\nmeaning in it. I am annoyed with myself if I have been talking of\r\nthings I know nothing about.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COn the contrary, MacPhail, you are so entirely right in what you say,\r\nthat I cannot for the life of me understand where or how you can have\r\ngot it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMr Graham used to talk to me about everything.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, but he was only a country schoolmaster.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA good deal more than that, sir,\u201D said Malcolm, solemnly. \u201CHe is a\r\ndisciple of him that knows everything. And now I think of it, I do\r\nbelieve that what I\u2019ve been saying about your picture, I must have got\r\nfrom hearing him talk about _the_ revelation, in which is included Isis\r\nherself, with her brother and all their train.\u201D\r\n\r\nLenorme held his peace. Malcolm had taken his place again\r\nunconsciously, and the painter was working hard, and looking very\r\nthoughtful. Malcolm went again to the picture.\r\n\r\n\u201CHillo!\u201D cried Lenorme, looking up and finding no object in the focus\r\nof his eyes.\r\n\r\nMalcolm returned directly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere was just one thing I wanted to see,\u201D he said, \u201C--whether the\r\nyouth worshipping his goddess, had come into her presence _clean_.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what is your impression of him?\u201D half murmured Lenorme, without\r\nlifting his head.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe one that\u2019s painted _there_,\u201D answered Malcolm, \u201Cdoes look as if\r\nhe might know that the least a goddess may claim of a worshipper is,\r\nthat he should come into her presence pure enough to understand her\r\npurity. I came upon a fine phrase the other evening in your English\r\nprayer-book. I never looked into it before, but I found one lying on\r\na book-stall, and it happened to open at the marriage service. There,\r\namongst other good things, the bridegroom says: \u2018With my body I thee\r\nworship.\u2019--\u2018That\u2019s grand,\u2019 I said to myself. \u2018That\u2019s as it should be.\r\nThe man whose body does not worship the woman he weds, should marry a\r\nharlot.\u2019 God bless Mr William Shakspere!--_he_ knew that. I remember Mr\r\nGraham telling me once, before I had read the play, that the critics\r\ncondemn _Measure for Measure_ as failing in poetic justice. I know\r\nlittle about the critics, and care less, for a man who has to earn\r\nhis bread and feed his soul as well, has enough to do with the books\r\nthemselves without what people say about them; and Mr Graham would\r\nnot tell me whether he thought the critics right or wrong; he wanted\r\nme to judge for myself. But when I came to read the play, I found, to\r\nmy mind, a most absolute and splendid justice in it. They think, I\r\nsuppose, that my lord Angelo should have been put to death. It just\r\nreveals the low breed of them; they think death the worst thing,\r\ntherefore the greatest punishment. But Angelo prays for death, that it\r\nmay hide him from his shame: it is too good for him, and he shall _not_\r\nhave it. He must live to remove the shame from Mariana. And then see\r\nhow Lucio is served!\u201D\r\n\r\nWhile Malcolm talked, Lenorme went on painting diligently, listening\r\nand saying nothing. When he had thus ended, a pause of some duration\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\u201CA goddess has a right to claim that one thing--has she not, Mr\r\nLenorme?\u201D said Malcolm at length, winding up a silent train of thought\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat thing?\u201D asked Lenorme, still without lifting his head.\r\n\r\n\u201CPurity in the arms a man holds out to her,\u201D answered Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly,\u201D replied Lenorme, with a sort of mechanical absoluteness.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd according to your picture, every woman whom a man loves is a\r\ngoddess--_the_ goddess of nature?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly;--but what _are_ you driving at? I can\u2019t paint for you.\r\nThere you stand,\u201D he went on, half angrily, \u201Cas if you were Socrates\r\nhimself, driving some poor Athenian buck into the corner of his\r\ndeserts! _I_ don\u2019t deserve any such insinuations, I would have you\r\nknow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am making none, sir. I dare never insinuate except I were prepared\r\nto charge. But I have told you I was bred up a fisher-lad, and partly\r\namong the fishers, to begin with. I half learned, half discovered\r\nthings that tended to give me what some would count severe notions: I\r\ncount them common sense. Then, as you know, I went into service, and in\r\nthat position it is easy enough to gather that many people hold very\r\nloose and very nasty notions about some things; so I just wanted to see\r\nhow you felt about such. If I had a sister now, and saw a man coming\r\nto woo her, all beclotted with puddle-filth--or if I knew that he had\r\njust left some woman as good as she, crying eyes and heart out over his\r\nchild--I don\u2019t know that I could keep my hands off him--at least if\r\nI feared she might take him. What do you think now? Mightn\u2019t it be a\r\nrighteous thing to throttle the scum and be hanged for it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D said Lenorme, \u201CI don\u2019t know why I should justify myself,\r\nespecially where no charge is made, MacPhail; and I don\u2019t know why\r\nto you any more than another man; but at this moment I am weak, or\r\negotistic, or sympathetic enough to wish you to understand that, so far\r\nas the poor matter of one virtue goes, I might without remorse act Sir\r\nGalahad in a play.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow you are beyond me,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo Lenorme had to tell him the old Armoric tale which Tennyson has\r\nsince rendered so lovelily, for, amongst artists at least, he was one\r\nof the earlier borrowers in the British legends. And as he told it, in\r\na half sullen kind of way, the heart of the young marquis glowed within\r\nhim, and he vowed to himself that Lenorme and no other should marry\r\nhis sister. But, lest he should reveal more emotion than the obvious\r\noccasion justified, he restrained speech, and again silence fell,\r\nduring which Lenorme was painting furiously.\r\n\r\n\u201CConfound it!\u201D he cried at last, and sprang to his feet, but without\r\ntaking his eyes from his picture, \u201Cwhat have I been doing all this\r\ntime but making a portrait of you, MacPhail, and forgetting what you\r\nwere there for! And yet,\u201D he went on, hesitating and catching up the\r\nminiature, \u201CI _have_ got a certain likeness! Yes, it must be so, for\r\nI see in it also a certain look of Lady Lossie. Well! I suppose a man\r\ncan\u2019t altogether help what he paints any more than what he dreams. That\r\nwill do for this morning, anyhow, I think, MacPhail. Make haste and put\r\non your own clothes, and come into the next room to breakfast. You must\r\nbe tired with standing so long.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt _is_ about the hardest work I ever tried,\u201D answered Malcolm; \u201Cbut I\r\ndoubt if I am as tired as Kelpie. I\u2019ve been listening for the last half\r\nhour to hear the stalls flying.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nAN EVIL OMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorimel was beginning to understand that the shield of the portrait\r\nwas not large enough to cover many more visits to the studio. Still she\r\nmust and would venture; and should anything be said, there at least was\r\nthe portrait. For some weeks it had been all but finished, was never\r\noff its easel, and always showed a touch of wet paint somewhere--he\r\nkept the last of it lingering, ready to prove itself almost yet not\r\naltogether finished. What was to follow its absolute completion,\r\nneither of them could tell. The worst of it was that their thoughts\r\nabout it differed discordantly. Florimel not unfrequently regarded the\r\nrupture of their intimacy as a thing not undesirable--this chiefly\r\nafter such a talk with Lady Bellair as had been illustrated by some\r\ntale of misalliance or scandal between high or low, of which kind of\r\nprovision for age the bold-faced countess had a large store: her memory\r\nwas little better than an ashpit of scandal. Amongst other biographical\r\nscraps one day she produced the case of a certain earl\u2019s daughter,\r\nwho, having disgraced herself by marrying a low fellow--an artist,\r\nshe believed--was as a matter of course neglected by the man whom, in\r\naccepting him, she had taught to despise her, and, before a twelvemonth\r\nwas over--her family finding it impossible to hold communication with\r\nher--was actually seen by her late maid scrubbing her own floor.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy couldn\u2019t she leave it dirty?\u201D said Florimel.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy indeed,\u201D returned Lady Bellair, \u201Cbut that people sink to their\r\nfortunes! Blue blood won\u2019t keep them out of the gutter.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe remark was true, but of more general application than she intended,\r\nseeing she herself was in the gutter and did not know it. She spoke\r\nonly of what followed on marriage beneath one\u2019s natal position, than\r\nwhich she declared there was nothing worse a woman of rank could do.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe may get over anything but that,\u201D she would say, believing, but not\r\nsaying, that she spoke from experience.\r\n\r\nWas it part of the late marquis\u2019s purgatory to see now, as the natural\r\nresult of the sins of his youth, the daughter whose innocence was dear\r\nto him exposed to all the undermining influences of this good natured\r\nbut low-moralled woman, whose ideas of the most mysterious relations of\r\nhumanity were in no respect higher than those of a class which must not\r\neven be mentioned in my pages? At such tales the high-born heart would\r\nflutter in Florimel\u2019s bosom, beat itself against its bars, turn sick at\r\nthe sight of its danger, imagine it had been cherishing a crime, and\r\nresolve--soon--before very long--at length--finally--to break so far at\r\nleast with the painter as to limit their intercourse to the radiation\r\nof her power across a dinner-table, the rhythmic heaving of their two\r\nhearts at a dance, or the quiet occasional talk in a corner, when the\r\nlooks of each would reveal to the other that they knew themselves the\r\nmartyrs of a cruel and inexorable law. It must be remembered that she\r\nhad had no mother since her childhood, that she was now but a girl,\r\nand that the passion of a girl to that of a woman is \u201Cas moonlight\r\nunto sunlight, and as water unto wine.\u201D Of genuine love she had little\r\nmore than enough to serve as salt to the passion; and passion, however\r\nbewitching, yea, entrancing a condition, may yet be of more worth\r\nthan that induced by opium or hashish, and a capacity for it may be\r\nconjoined with anything or everything contemptible and unmanly or\r\nunwomanly. In Florimel\u2019s case, however, there was chiefly much of the\r\nchildish in it. Definitely separated from Lenorme, she would have been\r\nmerry again in a fortnight; and yet, though she half knew this herself,\r\nand at the same time was more than half ashamed of the whole affair,\r\nshe did not give it up --would not--only intended by and by to let it\r\ngo, and meantime gave--occasionally--pretty free flutter to the half\r\ngrown wings of her fancy.\r\n\r\nHer liking for the painter had therefore, not unnaturally, its fits.\r\nIt was subject in a measure to the nature of the engagements she\r\nhad--that is, to the degree of pleasure she expected from them; it\r\nwas subject, as we have seen, to skilful battery from the guns of\r\nher chaperon\u2019s entrenchment; and more than to either was it subject\r\nto those delicate changes of condition which in the microcosm are as\r\nfrequent, and as varied both in kind and degree, as in the macrocosm.\r\nThe spirit has its risings and settings of sun and moon, its seasons,\r\nits clouds and stars, its solstices, its tides, its winds, its storms,\r\nits earthquakes--infinite vitality in endless fluctuation. To rule\r\nthese changes, Florimel had neither the power that comes of love,\r\nnor the strength that comes of obedience. What of conscience she had\r\nwas not yet conscience toward God, which is the guide to freedom,\r\nbut conscience toward society, which is the slave of a fool. It was\r\nno wonder then that Lenorme, believing--hoping she loved him, should\r\nfind her hard to understand. He said _hard_; but sometimes he meant\r\n_impossible_. He loved as a man loves who has thought seriously,\r\nspeculated, tried to understand; whose love therefore is consistent\r\nwith itself, harmonious with its nature and history, changing only\r\nin form and growth, never in substance and character. Hence the idea\r\nof Florimel became in his mind the centre of perplexing thought; the\r\nunrest of her being metamorphosed on the way, passed over into his,\r\nand troubled him sorely. Neither was his mind altogether free of the\r\ndread of reproach. For self-reproach he could find little or no ground,\r\nseeing that to pity her much for the loss of consideration her marriage\r\nwith him would involve, would be to undervalue the honesty of his love\r\nand the worth of his art; and indeed her position was so independently\r\nbased that she could not lose it even by marrying one who had not the\r\nsocial standing of a brewer or a stockbroker; but his pride was uneasy\r\nunder the foreseen criticism that his selfishness had taken advantage\r\nof her youth and inexperience to work on the mind of an ignorant\r\ngirl--a criticism not likely to be the less indignant that those who\r\npassed it would, without a shadow of compunction, have handed her over,\r\nbody, soul, and goods, to one of their own order, had he belonged to\r\nthe very canaille of the race.\r\n\r\nThe painter was not merely in love with Florimel: he loved her. I\r\nwill not say that he was in no degree dazzled by her rank, or that he\r\nfelt no triumph, as a social nomad camping on the No-Man\u2019s-Land of\r\nsociety, at the thought of the justification of the human against the\r\nconventional, in his scaling of the giddy heights of superiority, and,\r\non one of its topmost peaks, taking from her nest that rare bird in the\r\nearth, a landed and titled marchioness. But such thoughts were only\r\nchanging hues on the feathers of his love, which itself was a mighty\r\nbird with great and yet growing wings.\r\n\r\nA day or two passed before Florimel went again to the studio\r\naccompanied, notwithstanding Lenorme\u2019s warning and her own doubt, yet\r\nagain by her maid, a woman, unhappily, of Lady Bellair\u2019s finding. At\r\nLossie House, Malcolm had felt a repugnance to her, both moral and\r\nphysical. When first he heard her name, one of the servants speaking of\r\nher as Miss Caley, he took it for Scaley, and if that was not her name,\r\nyet scaly was her nature.\r\n\r\nThis time Florimel rode to Chelsea with Malcolm, having directed Caley\r\nto meet her there; and, the one designing to be a little early, and the\r\nother to be a little late, two results naturally followed --first, that\r\nthe lovers had a few minutes alone; and second, that when Caley crept\r\nin, noiseless and unannounced as a cat, she had her desire, and saw\r\nthe painter\u2019s arm round Florimel\u2019s waist, and her head on his bosom.\r\nStill more to her contentment, not hearing, they did not see her, and\r\nshe crept out again quietly as she had entered: it would of course be\r\nto her advantage to let them know that she had seen, and that they were\r\nin her power, but it might be still more to her advantage to conceal\r\nthe fact so long as there was a chance of additional discovery in the\r\nsame direction. Through the success of her trick it came about that\r\nMalcolm, chancing to look up from Honour\u2019s back to the room where he\r\nalways breakfasted with his new friend, saw in one of the windows, as\r\nin a picture, a face radiant with such an expression as that of the\r\nwoman-headed snake might have worn when he saw Adam take the apple from\r\nthe hand of Eve.\r\n\r\nCaley was of the common class of servants in this, that she considered\r\nservice servitude, and took her amends in selfishness; she was unlike\r\nthem in this, that while false to her employers, she made no common\r\ncause with her fellows against them--regarded and sought none but\r\nher own ends. Her one thought was to make the most of her position;\r\nfor that, to gain influence with, and, if it might be, power over\r\nher mistress; and, thereto, first of all, to find out whether she\r\nhad a secret: she had now discovered not merely that she had one,\r\nbut the secret itself! She was clever, greedy, cunning; equally\r\ncapable, according to the faculty with which she might be matched,\r\nof duping or of being duped. She rather liked her mistress, but\r\nwatched her in the interests of Lady Bellair. She had a fancy for the\r\nearl, a natural dislike for Malcolm which she concealed in distant\r\npoliteness, and for all the rest of the house, indifference. As to\r\nher person, she had a neat oval face, thin and sallow, in expression\r\nsubacid; a lithe, rather graceful figure, and hands too long, with\r\nfingers almost too tapering--of which hands and fingers she was very\r\ncareful, contemplating them in secret with a regard amounting almost\r\nto reverence: they were her sole witnesses to a descent in which she\r\nbelieved, but of which she had no other shadow of proof.\r\n\r\nCaley\u2019s face, then, with its unsaintly illumination, gave Malcolm\r\nsomething to think about as he sat there upon Honour, the new horse.\r\nClearly she had had a triumph: what could it be? The nature of the\r\nwoman was not altogether unknown to him even from the first, and he\r\ncould not for months go on meeting her occasionally in passages and on\r\nstairs without learning to understand his own instinctive dislike: it\r\nwas plain the triumph was not in good. It was plain too that it was\r\nin something which had that very moment occurred, and could hardly\r\nhave to do with anyone but her mistress. Then her being in that room\r\nrevealed more. They would never have sent her out of the study, and so\r\nput themselves in her power. She had gone into the house but a moment\r\nbefore, a minute or two behind her mistress, and he knew with what\r\na cat-like step she went about: she had surprised them---discovered\r\nhow matters stood between her mistress and the painter! He saw\r\neverything--almost as it had taken place. She had seen without being\r\nseen, and had retreated with her prize! Florimel was then in the\r\nwoman\u2019s power: what was he to do? He must at least let her gather what\r\nwarning she could from the tale of what he had seen.\r\n\r\nOnce arrived at a resolve, Malcolm never lost time. They had turned but\r\none corner on their way home, when he rode up to her.\r\n\r\n\u201CPlease, my lady,\u201D he began.\r\n\r\nBut the same instant Florimel was pulling up.\r\n\r\n\u201CMalcolm,\u201D she said, \u201CI have left my pocket-handkerchief. I must go\r\nback for it.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, she turned her horse\u2019s head. But Malcolm, dreading lest\r\nCaley should yet be lingering, would not allow her to expose herself to\r\na greater danger than she knew.\r\n\r\n\u201CBefore you go, my lady, I must tell you something I happened to see\r\nwhile I waited with the horses,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nThe earnestness of his tone struck Florimel. She looked at him with\r\neyes a little wider, and waited to hear.\r\n\r\n\u201CI happened to look up at the drawing-room windows, my lady, and Caley\r\ncame to one of them with _such_ a look on her face! I can\u2019t exactly\r\ndescribe it to you, my lady, but----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy do you tell me?\u201D interrupted his mistress, with absolute\r\ncomposure, and hard, questioning eyes.\r\n\r\nBut she had drawn herself up in the saddle. Then, before he could\r\nreply, a flash of thought seemed to cross her face with a quick single\r\nmotion of her eyebrows, and it was instantly altered and thoughtful.\r\nShe seemed to have suddenly perceived some cause for taking a mild\r\ninterest in his communication.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut it cannot be, Malcolm,\u201D she said, in quite a changed tone. \u201CYou\r\nmust have taken some one else for her. She never left the studio all\r\nthe time I was there.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was immediately after her arrival, my lady. She went in about two\r\nminutes after your ladyship, and could not have had _much_ more than\r\ntime to go upstairs when I saw her come to the window. I felt bound to\r\ntell your ladyship.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, Malcolm,\u201D returned Florimel kindly. \u201CYou did right to tell\r\nme,--but--it\u2019s of no consequence. Mr Lenorme\u2019s housekeeper and she must\r\nhave been talking about something.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut her eyebrows were now thoughtfully contracted over her eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere had been no time for that, I think, my lady,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\nFlorimel turned again and rode on, saying no more about the\r\nhandkerchief. Malcolm saw that he had succeeded in warning her, and was\r\nglad. But had he foreseen to what it would lead, he would hardly have\r\ndone it.\r\n\r\nFlorimel was indeed very uneasy. She could not help strongly suspecting\r\nthat she had betrayed herself to one who, if not an intentional spy,\r\nwould yet be ready enough to make a spy\u2019s use of anything she might\r\nhave picked up. What was to be done? It was now too late to think of\r\ngetting rid of her: that would be but her signal to disclose whatever\r\nshe had seen, and so not merely enjoy a sweet revenge, but account with\r\nclear satisfactoriness for her dismissal. What would not Florimel now\r\nhave given for some one who could sympathise with her and yet counsel\r\nher! She was afraid to venture another meeting with Lenorme, and\r\nbesides was not a little shy of the advantage the discovery would give\r\nhim in pressing her to marry him. And now first she began to feel as if\r\nher sins were going to find her out.\r\n\r\nA day or two passed in alternating psychical flaws and fogs-- with\r\npoor glints of sunshine between. She watched her maid, but her maid\r\nknew it, and discovered no change in her manner or behaviour. Weary of\r\nobservation she was gradually settling into her former security, when\r\nCaley began to drop hints that alarmed her. Might it not be altogether\r\nthe safest thing to take her into confidence? It would be such a\r\nrelief, she thought, to have a woman she could talk to! The result was\r\nthat she began to lift a corner of the veil that hid her trouble; the\r\nwoman encouraged her, and at length the silly girl threw her arms round\r\nthe scaly one\u2019s neck, much to that person\u2019s satisfaction, and told her\r\nthat she loved Mr Lenorme. She knew of course, she said, that she could\r\nnot marry him. She was only waiting a fit opportunity to free herself\r\nfrom a connection which, however delightful, she was unable to justify.\r\nHow the maid interpreted her confession, I do not care to enquire\r\nvery closely, but anyhow it was in a manner that promised much to her\r\nafter influence. I hasten over this part of Florimel\u2019s history, for\r\nthat confession to Caley was perhaps the one thing in her life she had\r\nmost reason to be ashamed of, for she was therein false to the being\r\nshe thought she loved best in the world. Could Lenorme have known her\r\ncapable of unbosoming herself to such a woman, it would almost have\r\nslain the love he bore her. The notions of that odd-and-end sort of\r\nperson, who made his livelihood by spreading paint, would have been too\r\nhideously shocked by the shadow of an intimacy between his love and\r\nsuch as she.\r\n\r\nCaley first comforted the weeping girl, and then began to insinuate\r\nencouragement. She must indeed give him up--there was no help for\r\nthat; but neither was there any necessity for doing so all at once. Mr\r\nLenorme was a beautiful man, and any woman might be proud to be loved\r\nby him. She must take her time to it. She might trust her. And so on\r\nand on--for she was as vulgar-minded as the worst of those whom ladies\r\nendure about their persons, handling their hair, and having access to\r\nmore of their lock-fast places than they would willingly imagine.\r\n\r\nThe first result was that, on the pretext of bidding him farewell, and\r\nconvincing him that he and she must meet no more, fate and fortune,\r\nsociety and duty being all alike against their happiness --I mean on\r\nthat pretext to herself, the only one to be deceived by it--Florimel\r\narranged with her woman one evening to go the next morning to the\r\nstudio: she knew the painter to be an early riser, and always at his\r\nwork before eight o\u2019clock. But although she tried to imagine she had\r\npersuaded herself to say farewell, certainly she had not yet brought\r\nher mind to any ripeness of resolve in the matter.\r\n\r\nAt seven o\u2019clock in the morning, the marchioness habited like a\r\nhousemaid, they slipped out by the front door, turned the corners of\r\ntwo streets, found a hackney coach waiting for them, and arrived in due\r\ntime at the painter\u2019s abode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nA QUARREL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the door opened and Florimel glided in, the painter sprang to his\r\nfeet to welcome her, and she flew softly, soundless as a moth, into his\r\narms; for the study being large and full of things, she was not aware\r\nof the presence of Malcolm. From behind a picture on an easel, he saw\r\nthem meet, but shrinking from being an open witness to their secret,\r\nand also from being discovered in his father\u2019s clothes by the sister\r\nwho knew him only as a servant, he instantly sought escape. Nor was it\r\nhard to find, for near where he stood was a door opening into a small\r\nintermediate chamber, communicating with the drawing-room, and by it\r\nhe fled, intending to pass through to Lenorme\u2019s bedroom, and change\r\nhis clothes. With noiseless stride he hurried away, but could not help\r\nhearing a few passionate words that escaped his sister\u2019s lips before\r\nLenorme could warn her that they were not alone--words which, it seemed\r\nto him, could come only from a heart whose very pulse was devotion.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow _can_ I live without you, Raoul?\u201D said the girl as she clung to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nLenorme gave an uneasy glance behind him, saw Malcolm disappear, and\r\nanswered,\r\n\r\n\u201CI hope you will never try, my darling.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, but you know this can\u2019t last,\u201D she returned, with playfully\r\naffected authority. \u201CIt must come to an end. They will interfere.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho can? Who will dare?\u201D said the painter with confidence.\r\n\r\n\u201CPeople will. We had better stop it ourselves--before it all comes out,\r\nand we are shamed,\u201D said Florimel, now with perfect seriousness.\r\n\r\n\u201CShamed!\u201D cried Lenorme. \u201C--Well, if you can\u2019t help being ashamed of\r\nme--and perhaps, as you have been brought up, you can\u2019t-- do you not\r\nthen love me enough to encounter a little shame for my sake? I should\r\nwelcome worlds of such for yours!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel was silent. She kept her face hidden on his shoulder, but was\r\nalready halfway to a quarrel.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t love me, Florimel!\u201D he said, after a pause, little thinking\r\nhow nearly true were the words.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, suppose I don\u2019t!\u201D she cried, half defiantly, half merrily; and\r\ndrawing herself from him, she stepped back two paces, and looked at\r\nhim with saucy eyes, in which burned two little flames of displeasure,\r\nthat seemed to shoot up from the red spots glowing upon her cheeks.\r\nLenorme looked at her. He had often seen her like this before, and\r\nknew that the shell was charged and the fuse lighted. But within lay a\r\nmixture even more explosive than he suspected; for not merely was there\r\nmore of shame and fear and perplexity mingled with her love than he\r\nunderstood, but she was conscious of having now been false to him, and\r\nthat rendered her temper dangerous.\r\n\r\nLenorme had already suffered severely from the fluctuations of her\r\nmoods. They had been almost too much for him. He could endure them,\r\nhe thought, to all eternity, if he had her to himself, safe and sure;\r\nbut the confidence to which he rose every now and then that she would\r\none day be his, just as often failed him, rudely shaken by some new\r\nsymptom of what almost seemed like cherished inconstancy. If after all\r\nshe should forsake him! It was impossible, but she might. If even that\r\nshould come, he was too much of a man to imagine anything but a stern\r\nencounter of the inevitable, and he knew he would survive it; but he\r\nknew also that life could never be the same again; that for a season\r\nwork would be impossible-- the kind of work he had hitherto believed\r\nhis own rendered for ever impossible perhaps, and his art degraded\r\nto the mere earning of a living. At best he would have to die and be\r\nburied and rise again before existence could become endurable under the\r\nnew squalid condition of life without her. It was no wonder then if her\r\nbehaviour sometimes angered him; for even against a Will o\u2019 the Wisp\r\nthat has enticed us into a swamp, a glow of foolish indignation will\r\nspring up. And now a black fire in his eyes answered the blue flash in\r\nhers; and the difference suggests the diversity of their loves: hers\r\nmight vanish in fierce explosion, his would go on burning like a coal\r\nmine. A word of indignant expostulation rose to his lips, but a thought\r\ncame that repressed it. He took her hand, and led her--the wonder\r\nwas that she yielded, for she had seen the glow in his eyes, and the\r\nfuse of her own anger burned faster; but she did yield, partly from\r\ncuriosity, and followed where he pleased --her hand lying dead in his.\r\nIt was but to the other end of the room he led her, to the picture of\r\nher father, now all but finished. Why he did so, he would have found\r\nit hard to say. Perhaps the Genius that lies under the consciousness\r\nforefelt a catastrophe, and urged him to give his gift ere giving\r\nshould be impossible.\r\n\r\nMalcolm stepped into the drawing-room, where the table was laid as\r\nusual for breakfast: there stood Caley, helping herself to a spoonful\r\nof honey from Hymettus. At his entrance she started violently, and her\r\nsallow face grew earthy. For some seconds she stood motionless, unable\r\nto take her eyes off the apparition, as it seemed to her, of the late\r\nmarquis, in wrath at her encouragement of his daughter in disgraceful\r\ncourses. Malcolm, supposing only she was ashamed of herself, took no\r\nfarther notice of her, and walked deliberately towards the other door.\r\nEre he reached it she knew him. Burning with the combined ires of\r\nfright and shame, conscious also that, by the one little contemptible\r\nact of greed in which he had surprised her, she had justified the\r\naversion which her woman-instinct had from the first recognized in him,\r\nshe darted to the door, stood with her back against it, and faced him\r\nflaming.\r\n\r\n\u201CSo!\u201D she cried, \u201Cthis is how my lady\u2019s kindness is abused! The\r\ninsolence! Her groom goes and sits for his portrait in her father\u2019s\r\ncourt dress!\u201D\r\n\r\nAs she ceased, all the latent vulgarity of her nature broke loose,\r\nand with a contracted _pff_ she seized her thin nose between her\r\nthumb and fore-finger, to the indication that an evil odour of fish\r\ninterpenetrated her atmosphere, and must at the moment be defiling the\r\ngarments of the dead marquis.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady shall know of this,\u201D she concluded, with a vicious clenching\r\nof her teeth, and two or three nods of her neat head.\r\n\r\nMalcolm stood regarding her with a coolness that yet inflamed\r\nher wrath. He could not help smiling at the reaction of shame in\r\nindignation. Had her anger been but a passing flame, that smile would\r\nhave turned it into enduring hate. She hissed in his face.\r\n\r\n\u201CGo and have the first word,\u201D he said; \u201Conly leave the door and let me\r\npass.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLet you pass indeed! What would you pass for?--The bastard of old\r\nLord James and a married woman!--I don\u2019t care _that_ for you.\u201D And she\r\nsnapped her fingers in his face.\r\n\r\nMalcolm turned from her and went to the window, taking a newspaper from\r\nthe breakfast-table as he passed, and there sat down to read until the\r\nway should be clear. Carried beyond herself by his utter indifference,\r\nCaley darted from the room and went straight into the study.\r\n\r\nLenorme led Florimel in front of the picture. She gave a great start,\r\nand turned and stared pallid at the painter. The effect upon her was\r\nsuch as he had not foreseen, and the words she uttered were not such as\r\nhe could have hoped to hear.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat would _he_ think of me if he knew?\u201D she cried, clasping her hands\r\nin agony.\r\n\r\nThat moment Caley burst into the room, her eyes lamping like a cat\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady!\u201D she shrieked, \u201Cthere\u2019s MacPhail, the groom, my lady, dressed\r\nup in your honoured father\u2019s bee-utiful clo\u2019es as he always wore when\r\nhe went to dine with the Prince! And, please, my lady, he\u2019s that rude I\r\ncould \u2019ardly keep my \u2019ands off him.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel flashed a dagger of question in Lenorme\u2019s eyes. The painter\r\ndrew himself up.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was at my request, Lady Lossie,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed!\u201D returned Florimel, in high scorn, and glanced again at the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n\u201CI see!\u201D she went on. \u201CHow could I be such an idiot! It was my groom\u2019s,\r\nnot my father\u2019s likeness you meant to surprise me with!\u201D\r\n\r\nHer eyes flashed as if she would annihilate him.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have worked hard in the hope of giving you pleasure, Lady Lossie,\u201D\r\nsaid the painter, with wounded dignity.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you have failed,\u201D she adjoined cruelly.\r\n\r\nThe painter took the miniature after which he had been working, from\r\na table near, handed it to her with a proud obeisance, and the same\r\nmoment dashed a brushful of dark paint across the face of the picture.\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, sir,\u201D said Florimel, and for a moment felt as if she hated\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nShe turned away and walked from the study. The door of the drawing-room\r\nwas open, and Caley stood by the side of it. Florimel, too angry to\r\nconsider what she was about, walked in: there sat Malcolm in the\r\nwindow, in her father\u2019s clothes, and his very attitude, reading the\r\nnewspaper. He did not hear her enter. He had been waiting till he could\r\nreach the bedroom unseen by her, for he knew from the sound of the\r\nvoices that the study door was open. Her anger rose yet higher at the\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\u201CLeave the room,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\nHe started to his feet, and now perceived that his sister was in the\r\ndress of a servant. He took one step forward and stood--a little\r\nmazed--gorgeous in dress and arms of price, before his mistress in the\r\ncotton gown of a housemaid.\r\n\r\n\u201CTake those clothes off instantly,\u201D said Florimel slowly, replacing\r\nwrath with haughtiness as well as she might. Malcolm turned to the door\r\nwithout a word. He saw that things had gone wrong where most he would\r\nhave wished them go right.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll see to them being well aired, my lady,\u201D said Caley, with sibilant\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nMalcolm went to the study. The painter sat before the picture of the\r\nmarquis, with his elbows on his knees, and his head between his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201CMr Lenorme,\u201D said Malcolm, approaching him gently.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, go away,\u201D said Lenorme, without raising his head. \u201CI can\u2019t bear\r\nthe sight of you yet.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm obeyed, a little smile playing about the corners of his mouth.\r\nCaley saw it as he passed, and hated him yet worse. He was in his own\r\nclothes, booted and belted, in two minutes. Three sufficed to replace\r\nhis father\u2019s garments in the portmanteau, and in three more he and\r\nKelpie went plunging past his mistress and her maid as they drove home\r\nin their lumbering vehicle.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe insolence of the fellow!\u201D said Caley, loud enough for her mistress\r\nto hear notwithstanding the noise of the rattling windows. \u201CA pretty\r\npass we are come to!\u201D\r\n\r\nBut already Florimel\u2019s mood had begun to change. She felt that she had\r\ndone her best to alienate men on whom she could depend, and that she\r\nhad chosen for a confidante one whom she had no ground for trusting.\r\n\r\nShe got safe and unseen to her room; and Caley believed she had only to\r\nimprove the advantage she had now gained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE TWO DAIMONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings had taken a turn that was not to Malcolm\u2019s satisfaction, and\r\nhis thoughts were as busy all the way home as Kelpie would allow. He\r\nhad ardently desired that his sister should be thoroughly in love\r\nwith Lenorme, for that seemed to open a clear path out of his worst\r\ndifficulties; now they had quarrelled; and besides were both angry\r\nwith him. The main fear was that Liftore would now make some progress\r\nwith her. Things looked dangerous. Even his warning against Caley had\r\nled to a result the very opposite of his intent and desire. And now it\r\nrecurred to him that he had once come upon Liftore talking to Caley,\r\nand giving her something that shone like a sovereign.\r\n\r\nEarlier on the same morning of her visit to the studio, Florimel had\r\nawaked and found herself in the presence of the spiritual Vehmgericht.\r\nEvery member of the tribunal seemed against her. All her thoughts were\r\nbusy accusing, none of them excusing one another. So hard were they\r\nupon her that she fancied she had nearly come to the conclusion that,\r\nif only she could do it pleasantly, without pain or fear, the best\r\nthing would be to swallow something and fall asleep; for like most\r\npeople she was practically an atheist, and therefore always thought of\r\ndeath as the refuge from the ills of life. But although she was often\r\nvery uncomfortable, Florimel knew nothing of such genuine downright\r\nmisery as drives some people to what can be no more to their purpose\r\nthan if a man should strip himself naked because he is cold. When she\r\nreturned from her unhappy visit, and had sent her attendant to get her\r\nsome tea, she threw herself upon her bed, and found herself yet again\r\nin the dark chambers of the spiritual police. But already even their\r\ncompany was preferable to that of Caley, whose officiousness began\r\nto enrage her. She was yet tossing in the Nessus-tunic of her own\r\ndisharmony, when Malcolm came for orders. To get rid of herself and\r\nCaley both, she desired him to bring the horses round at once.\r\n\r\nIt was more than Malcolm had expected. He ran: he might yet have a\r\nchance of trying to turn her in the right direction. He knew that\r\nLiftore was neither in the house nor at the stable. With the help of\r\nthe earl\u2019s groom, he was round in ten minutes. Florimel was all but\r\nready: like some other ladies she could dress quickly when she had\r\ngood reason. She sprang from Malcolm\u2019s hand to the saddle, and led\r\nas straight northward as she could go, never looking behind her till\r\nshe drew rein on the top of Hampstead Heath. When he rode up to her,\r\n\u201CMalcolm,\u201D she said, looking at him half ashamed, \u201CI don\u2019t think my\r\nfather _would_ have minded you wearing his clothes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, my lady,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CAt least he would have forgiven\r\nanything meant for your pleasure.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI was too hasty,\u201D she said. \u201CBut the fact was, Mr Lenorme had\r\nirritated me, and I foolishly mixed you up with him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen I went into the studio, after you left it, this morning my lady,\u201D\r\nMalcolm ventured, \u201Che had his head between his hands and would not even\r\nlook at me.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel turned her face aside, and Malcolm thought she was sorry; but\r\nshe was only hiding a smile: she had not yet got beyond the kitten\r\nstage of love, and was pleased to find she gave pain.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf your ladyship never had another true friend, Mr Lenorme is one,\u201D\r\nadded Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat opportunity can you have had for knowing?\u201D said Florimel.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have been sitting to him every morning for a good many days,\u201D\r\nanswered Malcolm. \u201C_He_ is something like a man!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel\u2019s face flushed with pleasure. She liked to hear him praised,\r\nfor he loved her.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou should have seen, my lady, the pains he took with that portrait!\r\nHe would stare at the little picture you lent him of my lord for\r\nminutes, as if he were looking through it at something behind it; then\r\nhe would get up and go and gaze at your ladyship on the pedestal, as\r\nif you were the goddess herself able to tell him everything about your\r\nfather; and then he would hurry back to his easel, and give a touch or\r\ntwo to the face, looking at it all the time as if he loved it. It must\r\nhave been a cruel pain that drove him to smear it as he did!\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel began to feel a little motion of shame somewhere in the\r\nmystery of her being. But to show that to her servant, would be to\r\nbetray herself--the more that he seemed the painter\u2019s friend.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will ask Lord Liftore to go and see the portrait, and if he thinks\r\nit like, I will buy it,\u201D she said. \u201CMr Lenorme is certainly very clever\r\nwith his brush.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm saw that she said this not to insult Lenorme, but to blind her\r\ngroom, and made no answer.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will ride there with you to-morrow morning,\u201D she added in\r\nconclusion, and moved on.\r\n\r\nMalcolm touched his hat, and dropped behind. But the next moment he was\r\nby her side again.\r\n\r\n\u201CI beg your pardon, my lady, but would you allow me to say one word\r\nmore?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat woman Caley, I am certain, is not to be trusted. She does not\r\nlove you, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do you know that?\u201D asked Florimel, speaking steadily, but writhing\r\ninwardly with the knowledge that the warning was too late.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have tried her spirit,\u201D answered Malcolm, \u201Cand know that it is of\r\nthe devil. She loves herself too much to be true.\u201D\r\n\r\nAfter a little pause Florimel said,\r\n\r\n\u201CI know you mean well, Malcolm; but it is nothing to me whether she\r\nloves me or not. We don\u2019t look for that now-a-days from servants.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is because I love you, my lady,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cthat I know Caley\r\ndoes not. If she should get hold of anything your ladyship would not\r\nwish talked about,--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat she cannot,\u201D said Florimel, but with an inward shudder. \u201CShe may\r\ntell the whole world all she can discover.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe would have cantered on as the words left her lips, but something\r\nin Malcolm\u2019s looks held her. She turned pale; she trembled: her father\r\nwas looking at her as only once had she seen him--in doubt whether his\r\nchild lied. The illusion was terrible. She shook in her saddle. The\r\nnext moment she was galloping along the grassy border of the heath\r\nin wild flight from her worst enemy, whom yet she could never by the\r\nwildest of flights escape; for when, coming a little to herself as she\r\napproached a sand pit, she pulled up, there was her enemy--neither\r\nbefore nor behind, neither above nor beneath nor within her: it was the\r\nself which had just told a lie to the servant of whom she had so lately\r\nboasted that he never told one in his life. Then she grew angry. What\r\nhad she done to be thus tormented? _She_ a marchioness, thus pestered\r\nby her own menials --pulled in opposing directions by a groom and a\r\nmaid. She would turn them both away, and have nobody about her, either\r\nto trust or suspect.\r\n\r\nShe might have called them her good and her evil demon; for she\r\nknew--that is, she had it somewhere about her, but did not look it\r\nout--that it was her own cowardice and concealment, her own falseness\r\nto the traditional, never failing courage of her house, her ignobility,\r\nand unfitness to represent the Colonsays--her double dealing in short,\r\nthat had made the marchioness in her own right the slave of her woman,\r\nthe rebuked of her groom!\r\n\r\nShe turned and rode back, looking the other way as she passed Malcolm.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the top of the heath, riding along to meet them\r\ncame Liftore--this time to Florimel\u2019s consolation and comfort: she\r\ndid not like riding unprotected with a good angel at her heels. So\r\nglad was she that she did not even take the trouble to wonder how he\r\nhad discovered the road she went. She never suspected that Caley had\r\nsent his lordship\u2019s groom to follow her until the direction of her\r\nride should be evident, but took his appearance without question, as a\r\nloverlike attention, and rode home with him, talking the whole way, and\r\ncherishing a feeling of triumph over both Malcolm and Lenorme. Had she\r\nnot a protector of her own kind? Could she not, when they troubled her,\r\npass from their sphere into one beyond their ken? For the poor moment,\r\nthe weak lord who rode beside her seemed to her foolish heart a tower\r\nof refuge. She was particularly gracious to her lover as they rode, and\r\nfancied again and again that perhaps the best way out of her troubles\r\nwould be to encourage and at last accept him, so getting rid of honeyed\r\ndelights and rankling stings together, of good and evil angels and\r\nlow-bred lover at one sweep. Quiet would console for dulness, innocence\r\nfor weariness. She would fain have a good conscience toward Society--\r\nthat image whose feet are of gold and its head a bag of chaff and\r\nsawdust.\r\n\r\nMalcolm followed, sick at heart that she should prove herself so\r\nshallow. Riding Honour, he had plenty of leisure to brood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nA CHASTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she went to her room, there was Caley taking from a portmanteau\r\nthe Highland dress which had occasioned so much. A note fell, and she\r\nhanded it to her mistress. Florimel opened it, grew pale as she read\r\nit, and asked Caley to bring her a glass of water. No sooner had her\r\nmaid left the room than she sprang to the door and bolted it. Then the\r\ntears burst from her eyes, she sobbed despairingly, and but for the\r\nhelp of her handkerchief would have wailed aloud. When Caley returned,\r\nshe answered to her knock that she was lying down, and wanted to sleep.\r\nShe was, however, trying to force further communication from the note.\r\nIn it the painter told her that he was going to set out the next\r\nmorning for Italy, and that her portrait was at the shop of certain\r\ncarvers and gliders, being fitted with a frame for which he had made\r\ndrawings. Three times she read it, searching for some hidden message to\r\nher heart; she held it up between her and the light; then before the\r\nfire till it crackled like a bit of old parchment; but all was in vain:\r\nby no device, intellectual or physical, could she coax the shadow of a\r\nmeaning out of it, beyond what lay plain on the surface. She must, she\r\n_would_ see him again.\r\n\r\nThat night she was merrier than usual at dinner; after it, sang\r\nballad after ballad to please Liftore; then went to her room and told\r\nCaley to arrange for yet a visit, the next morning, to Mr Lenorme\u2019s\r\nstudio. She positively must, she said, secure her father\u2019s portrait\r\nere the ill-tempered painter--all men of genius were hasty and\r\nunreasonable--should have destroyed it utterly, as he was certain to do\r\nbefore leaving--and with that she showed her Lenorme\u2019s letter. Caley\r\nwas all service, only said that this time she thought they had better\r\ngo openly. She would see Lady Bellair as soon as Lady Lossie was in\r\nbed, and explain the thing to her.\r\n\r\nThe next morning therefore they drove to Chelsea in the carriage. When\r\nthe door opened, Florimel walked straight up to the study. There she\r\nsaw no one, and her heart, which had been fluttering strangely, sank,\r\nand was painfully still, while her gaze went wandering about the room.\r\nIt fell upon the pictured temple of Isis: a thick dark veil had fallen\r\nand shrouded the whole figure of the goddess, leaving only the outline;\r\nand the form of the worshipping youth had vanished utterly: where he\r\nhad stood, the tesselated pavement, with the serpent of life twining\r\nthrough it, and the sculptured walls of the temple, shone out clear\r\nand bare, as if Hyacinth had walked out into the desert to return no\r\nmore. Again the tears gushed from the heart of Florimel: she had sinned\r\nagainst her own fame--had blotted out a fair memorial record that might\r\nhave outlasted the knight of stone under the Norman canopy in Lossie\r\nchurch. Again she sobbed, again she choked down a cry that had else\r\nbecome a scream.\r\n\r\nArms were around her. Never doubting whose the embrace, she leaned her\r\nhead against his bosom, stayed her sobs with the one word \u201C_Cruel!_\u201D\r\nand slowly opening her tearful eyes, lifted them to the face that bent\r\nover hers. It was Liftore\u2019s. She was dumb with disappointment and\r\ndismay. It was a hateful moment. He kissed her forehead and eyes, and\r\nsought her mouth. She shrieked aloud. In her very agony at the loss\r\nof one to be kissed by another!--and there! It was too degrading! too\r\nhorrid!\r\n\r\nAt the sound of her cry someone started up at the other end of the\r\nroom. An easel with a large canvas on it fell, and a man came forward\r\nwith great strides. Liftore let her go, with a muttered curse on the\r\nintruder, and she darted from the room into the arms of Caley, who\r\nhad had her ear against the other side of the door. The same instant\r\nMalcolm received from his lordship a well planted blow between the\r\neyes, which filled them with flashes and darkness. The next, the earl\r\nwas on the floor. The ancient fury of the Celt had burst up into the\r\nnineteenth century, and mastered a noble spirit. All Malcolm could\r\nafterwards remember was that he came to himself dealing Liftore\r\nmerciless blows, his foot on his back, and his weapon the earl\u2019s whip.\r\nHis lordship, struggling to rise, turned up a face white with hate and\r\nimpotent fury.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou damned flunkie!\u201D he panted. \u201CI\u2019ll have you shot like a mangy dog.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMeanwhile I will chastise you like an insolent nobleman,\u201D said\r\nMalcolm, who had already almost recovered his self-possession. \u201CYou\r\ndare to touch my mistress!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd with the words he gave him one more stinging cut with the whip.\r\n\r\n\u201CStand off, and let it be man to man,\u201D cried Liftore, with a fierce\r\noath, clenching his teeth in agony and rage.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat it cannot be, my lord; but I have had enough, and so I hope has\r\nyour lordship,\u201D said Malcolm; and as he spoke he threw the whip to the\r\nother end of the room, and stood back. Liftore sprang to his feet, and\r\nrushed at him. Malcolm caught him by the wrist with a fisherman\u2019s grasp.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lord, I don\u2019t want to kill you. Take a warning, and let ill be, for\r\nfear of worse,\u201D he said, and threw his hand from him with a swing that\r\nnearly dislocated his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe warning sufficed. His lordship cast him one scowl of concentrated\r\nhate and revenge, and leaving the room hurried also from the house.\r\n\r\nAt the usual morning hour, Malcolm had ridden to Chelsea, hoping to\r\nfind his friend in a less despairing and more companionable mood than\r\nwhen he left him. To his surprise and disappointment he learned that\r\nLenorme had sailed by the packet to Ostend the night before. He asked\r\nleave to go into the study. There on its easel stood the portrait of\r\nhis father as he had last seen it--disfigured with a great smear of\r\nbrown paint across the face. He knew that the face was dry, and he\r\nsaw that the smear was wet: he would see whether he could not, with\r\nturpentine and a soft brush, remove the insult. In this endeavour he\r\nwas so absorbed, and by the picture itself was so divided from the rest\r\nof the room, that he neither saw nor heard anything until Florimel\r\ncried out.\r\n\r\nNaturally, those events made him yet more dissatisfied with his\r\nsister\u2019s position. Evil influences and dangers were on all sides\r\nof her--the worst possible outcome being that, loving one man, she\r\nshould marry another, and him such a man as Liftore. Whatever he heard\r\nin the servants\u2019 hall, both tone and substance, only confirmed the\r\nunfavourable impression he had had from the first of the bold-faced\r\ncountess. The oldest of her servants had, he found, the least respect\r\nfor their mistress, although all had a certain liking for her, which\r\ngave their disrespect the heavier import. He _must_ get Florimel away\r\nsomehow. While all was right between her and the painter he had been\r\nless anxious about her immediate surroundings, trusting that Lenorme\r\nwould ere long deliver her. But now she had driven him from the very\r\ncountry, and he had left no clue to follow him up by. His housekeeper\r\ncould tell nothing of his purposes. The gardener and she were left in\r\ncharge as a matter of course. He might be back in a week, or a year;\r\nshe could not even conjecture.\r\n\r\nSeeming possibilities, in varied mingling with rank absurdities passing\r\nthrough Malcolm\u2019s mind, as, after Liftore\u2019s punishment, he lifted the\r\nportrait, set it again upon its easel, and went on trying to clean the\r\nface of it--with no small promise of success. But as he made progress\r\nhe grew anxious--lest with the defilement, he should remove some of\r\nthe colour as well: the painter alone, he concluded at length could be\r\ntrusted to restore the work he had ruined.\r\n\r\nHe left the house, walked across the road to the river-bank, and gave\r\na short sharp whistle. In an instant Davy was in the dinghy, pulling\r\nfor the shore. Malcolm went on board the yacht, saw that all was right,\r\ngave some orders, went ashore again, and mounted Kelpie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nLIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn pain, wrath, and mortification, Liftore rode home. What would\r\nthe men at his club say if they knew that he had been thrashed by a\r\nscoundrel of a groom for kissing his mistress? The fact would soon\r\nbe out: he must do his best to have it taken for what it ought to\r\nbe--namely, fiction. It was the harder upon him that he knew himself\r\nno coward. He must punish the rascal somehow--he owed it to society\r\nto punish him; but at present he did not see how, and the first thing\r\nwas to have the first word with Florimel; he must see her before she\r\nsaw the ruffian. He rode as hard as he dared to Curzon Street, sent\r\nhis groom to the stables, telling him he should want the horses again\r\nbefore lunch, had a hot bath, of which he stood in dire need, and some\r\nbrandy with his breakfast, and then, all unfit for exercise as he was,\r\nwalked to Portland Place.\r\n\r\nMistress and maid rode home together in silence. The moment Florimel\r\nheard Malcolm\u2019s voice she had left the house. Caley following had\r\nheard enough to know that there was a scuffle at least going on in\r\nthe study, and her eye witnessed against her heart that Liftore could\r\nhave no chance with the detested groom if the respect of the latter\r\ngave way: would MacPhail thrash his lordship? If he did, it would be\r\nwell she should know it. In the hoped event of his lordship\u2019s marrying\r\nher mistress, it was desirable, not only that she should be in favour\r\nwith both of them, but that she should have some hold upon each of a\r\nmore certainly enduring nature: if she held secrets with husband and\r\nwife separately, she would be in clover for the period of her natural\r\nexistence. As to Florimel, she was enraged at the liberties Liftore\r\nhad taken with her. But alas! was she not in some degree in his power?\r\nHe had found her there, and in tears! How did he come to be there? If\r\nMalcolm\u2019s judgment of her was correct, Caley might have told him. Was\r\nshe already false? She pondered within herself, and cast no look upon\r\nher maid until she had concluded how best to carry herself towards the\r\nearl. Then glancing at the hooded cobra beside her--\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat an awkward thing that Lord Liftore, of all moments, should appear\r\njust then!\u201D she said. \u201CHow could it be?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure I haven\u2019t an idea, my lady,\u201D returned Caley. \u201CMy lord has\r\nbeen always kind to Mr Lenorme, and I suppose he has been in the way of\r\ngoing to see him at work. Who would have thought my lord had been such\r\nan early riser! There are not many gentlemen like him now-a-days, my\r\nlady! Did your ladyship hear the noise in the studio after you left it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI heard high words,\u201D answered her mistress, \u201C--nothing more. How on\r\nearth did MacPhail come to be there as well?--From you, Caley, I will\r\nnot conceal that his lordship behaved indiscreetly; in fact he was\r\nrude; and I can quite imagine that MacPhail thought it his duty to\r\ndefend me. It is all very awkward for me. Who could have imagined _him_\r\nthere, and sitting behind amongst the pictures! It almost makes me\r\ndoubt whether Mr Lenorme be really gone.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt seems to me, my lady,\u201D returned Caley, \u201Cthat the man is always\r\njust where he ought not to be, always meddling with something he has\r\nno business with. I beg your pardon, my lady,\u201D she went on, \u201Cbut\r\nwouldn\u2019t it be better to get some staid elderly man for a groom, one\r\nwho has been properly bred up to his duties and taught his manners in a\r\ngentleman\u2019s stable? It is so odd to have a groom from a rough seafaring\r\nset--one who behaves like the rude fisherman he is, never having had\r\nto obey orders of lord or lady! The worst of it is, your ladyship will\r\nsoon be the town\u2019s talk if you have such a groom on such a horse after\r\nyou everywhere.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel\u2019s face flushed. Caley saw she was angry, and held her peace.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was hardly over, when Liftore walked in, looking pale, and,\r\nin spite of his faultless _get-up_, somewhat disreputable: for shame,\r\nsecret pain, and anger do not favour a good carriage or honest mien.\r\nFlorimel threw herself back in her chair--an action characteristic\r\nof the bold-faced countess, and held out her left hand to him in an\r\nexpansive, benevolent sort of way.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow dare you come into my presence, looking so well pleased with\r\nyourself, my lord, after giving me such a fright this morning?\u201D she\r\nsaid. \u201CYou might at least have made sure that there was--that we\r\nwere----\u201D She could not bring herself to complete the sentence.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy dearest girl!\u201D said his lordship, not only delighted to get off so\r\npleasantly, but profoundly flattered by the implied understanding, \u201CI\r\nfound you in tears, and how could I think of anything else? It may have\r\nbeen stupid, but I trust you will think it pardonable.\u201D\r\n\r\nCaley had not fully betrayed her mistress to his lordship, and he had,\r\nentirely to his own satisfaction, explained the liking of Florimel\r\nfor the society of the painter as the mere fancy of a girl for the\r\nadmiration of one whose employment, although nothing above the\r\nservile, yet gave him a claim something beyond that of a milliner or\r\nhair-dresser, to be considered a judge in matters of appearance. As to\r\nanything more in the affair--and with _him_ in the field--of such a\r\nnotion he was simply incapable: he could not have wronged the lady he\r\nmeant to honour with his hand, by regarding it as within the bounds of\r\nthe possible.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was no wonder I was crying,\u201D said Florimel. \u201CA seraph would have\r\ncried to see the state my father\u2019s portrait was in.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYour father\u2019s portrait!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. Did you not know? Mr Lenorme has been painting one from a\r\nminiature I lent him--under my supervision, of course; and just because\r\nI let fall a word that showed I was not altogether satisfied with the\r\nlikeness, what should the wretched man do but catch up a brush full of\r\nfilthy black paint, and smudge the face all over!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Lenorme will soon set it to rights again. He\u2019s not a bad fellow\r\nthough he does belong to the _genus irritabile_. I will go about it\r\nthis very day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll not find him, I\u2019m sorry to say. There\u2019s a note I had from him\r\nyesterday. And the picture\u2019s quite unfit to be seen--utterly ruined.\r\nBut I _can\u2019t_ think how you could miss it!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTo tell you the truth, Florimel, I had a bit of a scrimmage after\r\nyou left me in the studio.\u201D Here his lordship did his best to imitate\r\na laugh. \u201CWho should come rushing upon me out of the back regions of\r\npaint and canvas but that mad groom of yours! I don\u2019t suppose you knew\r\nhe was there?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot I. I saw a man\u2019s feet--that was all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, there he was, for what reason the devil knows, perdu amongst\r\nthe painter\u2019s litter; and when he heard your little startled cry\r\n--most musical, most melancholy--what should he fancy but that you\r\nwere frightened, and he must rush to the rescue! And so he did with a\r\nvengeance: I don\u2019t know when I shall quite forget the blow he gave me.\u201D\r\nAnd again Liftore laughed, or thought he did.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe struck you!\u201D exclaimed Florimel, rather astonished, but hardly able\r\nfor inward satisfaction to put enough of indignation into her tone.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe did, the fellow!--But don\u2019t say a word about it, for I thrashed him\r\nso unmercifully that, to tell the truth, I had to stop because I grew\r\nsorry for him. I am sorry now. So I hope you will take no notice of it.\r\nIn fact, I begin to like the rascal: you know I was never favourably\r\nimpressed with him. By Jove! it is not every mistress that can have\r\nsuch a devoted attendant. I only hope his over-zeal in your service may\r\nnever get you into some compromising position. He is hardly, with all\r\nhis virtues, the proper servant for a young lady to have about her;\r\nhe has had no training--no _proper_ training at all, you see. But you\r\nmust let the villain nurse himself for a day or two anyhow. It would be\r\ntorture to make him ride, after what I gave him.\u201D\r\n\r\nHis lordship spoke feelingly, with heroic endurance indeed; and if\r\nMalcolm should dare give _his_ account of the fracas, he trusted to the\r\nword of a gentleman to outweigh that of a groom.\r\n\r\nNot all to whom it may seem incredible that a nobleman should thus lie,\r\nare themselves incapable of doing likewise. Any man may put himself in\r\ntraining for a liar by doing things he would be ashamed to have known.\r\nThe art is easily learned, and to practise it well is a great advantage\r\nto people with _designs_. Men of ability, indeed, if they take care\r\nnot to try hard to speak the truth, will soon become able to lie as\r\ntruthfully as any sneak that sells grease for butter to the poverty of\r\nthe New Cut.\r\n\r\nIt is worth remarking to him who can from the lie factual carry his\r\nthought deeper to the lie essential, that all the power of a lie comes\r\nfrom the truth; it has none in itself. So strong is the truth that a\r\nmere resemblance to it is the source of strength to its opposite--until\r\nit be found that _like_ is not _the same_.\r\n\r\nFlorimel had already made considerable progress in the art, but\r\nproficiency in lying does not always develop the power of detecting it.\r\nShe knew that her father had on one occasion struck Malcolm, and that\r\nhe had taken it with the utmost gentleness, confessing himself in the\r\nwrong. Also she had the impression that for a menial to lift his hand\r\nagainst a gentleman, even in self-defence, was a thing unheard of. The\r\nblow Malcolm had struck Liftore was for her, not himself. Therefore,\r\nwhile her confidence in Malcolm\u2019s courage and prowess remained\r\nunshaken, she was yet able to believe that Liftore had done as he\r\nsaid, and supposed that Malcolm had submitted. In her heart she pitied\r\nwithout despising him.\r\n\r\nCaley herself took him the message that he would not be wanted. As she\r\ndelivered it, she smiled an evil smile and dropped a mocking courtesy,\r\nwith her gaze well fixed on his two black eyes and the great bruise\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nWhen Liftore mounted to accompany Lady Lossie, it took all the pluck\r\nthat belonged to his high breed to enable him to smile and smile, with\r\ntwenty counsellors in different parts of his body feelingly persuading\r\nhim that he was at least a liar. As they rode, Florimel asked him how\r\nhe came to be at the studio that morning. He told her that he had\r\nwanted very much to see her portrait before the final touches were\r\ngiven it. He could have made certain suggestions, he believed, that\r\nno one else could. He had indeed, he confessed-- and felt absolutely\r\nvirtuous in doing so, because here he spoke a fact--heard from his\r\naunt that Florimel was to be there that morning for the last time: it\r\nwas therefore his only chance; but he had expected to be there hours\r\nbefore she was out of bed. For the rest, be hoped he had been punished\r\nenough, seeing her rascally groom--and once more his lordship laughed\r\npeculiarly--had but just failed of breaking his arm; it was all he\r\ncould do to hold the reins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nAN OLD ENEMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Sunday evening--it must have been just while Malcolm and Blue Peter\r\nstood in the Strand listening to a voluntary that filled and overflowed\r\nan otherwise empty church--a short, stout, elderly woman was walking\r\nlightly along the pavement of a street of small houses, not far from a\r\nthoroughfare which, crowded like a market the night before, had now two\r\nlively borders only--of holiday-makers mingled with church-goers. The\r\nbells for evening prayers were ringing. The sun had vanished behind the\r\nsmoke and steam of London; indeed he might have set--it was hard to say\r\nwithout consulting the almanac: but it was not dark yet. The lamps in\r\nthe street were lighted, however, and also in the church she passed.\r\nShe carried a small Bible in her hand, folded in a pocket-handkerchief,\r\nand looked a decent woman from the country. Her quest was a place where\r\nthe minister said his prayers and did not read them out of a book: she\r\nhad been brought up a Presbyterian, and had prejudices in favour of\r\nwhat she took for the simpler form of worship. Nor had she gone much\r\nfarther before she came upon a chapel which seemed to promise all she\r\nwanted. She entered, and a sad-looking woman showed her to a seat.\r\nShe sat down square, fixing her eyes at once on the pulpit, rather\r\ndimly visible over many pews, as if it were one of the mountains that\r\nsurrounded her Jerusalem. The place was but scantily lighted, for\r\nthe community at present could ill afford to burn daylight. When the\r\nworship commenced, and the congregation rose to sing, she got up with\r\na jerk that showed the duty as unwelcome as unexpected, but seemed by\r\nthe way she settled herself in her seat for the prayer, already thereby\r\nreconciled to the differences between Scotch church-customs and English\r\nchapel-customs. She went to sleep softly, and woke warily as the prayer\r\ncame to a close.\r\n\r\nWhile the congregation again sang, the minister who had officiated\r\nhitherto left the pulpit, and another ascended to preach. When he began\r\nto read the text, the woman gave a little start, and leaning forward,\r\npeered very hard to gain a satisfactory sight of his face between the\r\ncandles on each side of it, but without success; she soon gave up her\r\nattempted scrutiny, and thence-forward seemed to listen with marked\r\nattention. The sermon was a simple, earnest, at times impassioned\r\nappeal to the hearts and consciences of the congregation. There was\r\nlittle attempt in it at the communication of knowledge of any kind, but\r\nthe most indifferent hearer must have been aware that the speaker was\r\nearnestly straining after something. To those who understood, it was as\r\nif he would force his way through every stockade of prejudice, ditch\r\nof habit, rampart of indifference, moat of sin, wall of stupidity, and\r\ncurtain of ignorance, until he stood face to face with the conscience\r\nof his hearer.\r\n\r\n\u201CRank Arminianism!\u201D murmured the woman. \u201CWhaur\u2019s the gospel o\u2019 that?\u201D\r\nBut still she listened with seeming intentness, while something of\r\nwonder mingled with the something else that set in motion every live\r\nwrinkle in her forehead, and made her eyebrows undulate like writhing\r\nsnakes.\r\n\r\nAt length the preacher rose to eloquence, an eloquence inspired by\r\nthe hunger of his soul after truth eternal, and the love he bore to\r\nhis brethren who fed on husks--an eloquence innocent of the tricks of\r\nelocution or the arts of rhetoric: to have discovered himself using one\r\nof them would have sent him home to his knees in shame and fear--an\r\neloquence not devoid of discords, the strings of his instrument being\r\nnow slack with emotion, now tense with vision, yet even in those\r\ndiscords shrouding the essence of all harmony. When he ceased, the\r\nsilence that followed seemed instinct with thought, with that speech of\r\nthe spirit which no longer needs the articulating voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt _canna_ be the stickit minister!\u201D said the woman to herself.\r\n\r\nThe congregation slowly dispersed, but she sat motionless until all\r\nwere gone, and the sad-faced woman was putting out the lights. Then\r\nshe rose, drew near through the gloom, and asked her the name of the\r\ngentleman who had given them such a grand sermon. The woman told her,\r\nadding that, although he had two or three times spoken to them at the\r\nprayer meeting--such words of comfort, the poor soul added, as she had\r\nnever in her life heard before--this was the first time he had occupied\r\nthe pulpit. The woman thanked her, and went out into the street.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod bless me!\u201D she said to herself, as she walked away; \u201Cit _is_ the\r\nstickit minister! Weel, won\u2019ers \u2019ill never cease. The age o\u2019 mirracles\r\n\u2019ill be come back, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019!\u201D And she laughed an oily contemptuous\r\nlaugh in the depths of her profuse person.\r\n\r\nWhat caused her astonishment need cause none to the thoughtful mind.\r\nThe man was no longer burdened with any anxiety as to his reception\r\nby his hearers; he was hampered by no necromantic agony to raise the\r\ndead letter of the sermon buried in the tail-pocket of his coat; he had\r\nthirty years more of life, and a whole granary filled with such truths\r\nas grow for him who is ever breaking up the clods of his being to the\r\nspiritual sun and wind and dew; and above all, he had an absolute yet\r\nexpanding confidence in his Father in heaven, and a tender love for\r\neverything human. The tongue of the dumb had been in training for song.\r\nAnd first of all he had learned to be silent while he had nought to\r\nreveal. He had been trained to babble about religion, but through God\u2019s\r\ngrace had failed in his babble, and that was in itself a success. He\r\nwould have made one of the swarm that year after year cast themselves\r\nlike flies on the burning sacrifice that they may live on its flesh,\r\nwith evil odours extinguishing the fire that should have gone up in\r\nflame; but a burning coal from off the altar had been laid on his lips,\r\nand had silenced them in torture. For thirty years he had held his\r\npeace, until the word of God had become as a fire in his bones: it was\r\nnow breaking forth in flashes.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday, Mrs Catanach sought the shop of the deacon that was an\r\nironmonger, secured for herself a sitting in the chapel for the next\r\nhalf-year, and prepaid the sitting.\r\n\r\n\u201CWha kens,\u201D she said to herself, \u201Cwhat birds may come to gether worms\r\nan\u2019 golachs (_beetles_) aboot the boody-craw (_scarecrow_), Sanny\r\nGrame!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was one to whom intrigue, founded on the knowledge of private\r\nhistory, was as the very breath of her being: she could not exist in\r\ncomposure without it. Wherever she went, therefore--and her changes\r\nof residence had not been few--it was one of her first cares to enter\r\ninto connection with some religious community, first that she might\r\nhave scope for her calling--that of a midwife, which in London would\r\nprobably be straightened towards that of mere monthly nurse--and next\r\nthat thereby she might have good chances for the finding of certain\r\nweeds of occult power that spring mostly in walled gardens, and are\r\nrare on the roadside--poisonous things mostly, called generically\r\n_secrets_.\r\n\r\nAt this time she had been for some painful months in possession of a\r\nmost important one--painful, I say, because all those months she had\r\ndiscovered no possibility of making use of it. The trial had been\r\nhard. Her one passion was to drive the dark horses of society, and\r\nhere she had been sitting week after week on the coach-box over the\r\nfinest team she had ever handled, ramping and \u201Cfoming tarre,\u201D unable\r\nto give them their heads because the demon-grooms had disappeared and\r\nleft the looped traces dangling from their collars. She had followed\r\nFlorimel from Portlossie--to Edinburgh, and then to London, but not yet\r\nhad seen how to approach her with probable advantage. In the meantime\r\nshe had renewed old relations with a certain herb-doctor in Kentish\r\nTown, at whose house she was now accommodated. There she had already\r\nbegun to entice the confidences of maid-servants, by use of what evil\r\nknowledge she had, and pretence to more, giving herself out as a wise\r\nwoman. Her faith never failed her that, if she but kept handling the\r\nfowls of circumstance, one or other of them must at length drop an egg\r\nof opportunity in her lap. When she stumbled upon the schoolmaster,\r\npreaching in a chapel near her own haunts, she felt something more like\r\na gust of gratitude to the dark power that sat behind and pulled the\r\nstrings of events--for thus she saw through her own projected phantom\r\nthe heart of the universe--than she had ever yet experienced. If there\r\nwere such things as special providences, here, she said, was one; if\r\nnot, then it was better luck than she had looked for. The main point in\r\nit was that the dominie seemed likely after all to turn out a popular\r\npreacher; then beyond a doubt other Scotch people would gather to him;\r\nthis or that person might turn up, and anyone might turn out useful;\r\none thread might be knotted to another, until all together had made a\r\nclue to guide her straight through the labyrinth to the centre, to lay\r\nher hand on the collar of the demon of the house of Lossie. It was the\r\nbiggest game of her life, and had been its game long before the opening\r\nof my narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE EVIL GENIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Malcolm first visited Mr Graham, the schoolmaster had already\r\npreached two or three times in the pulpit of Hope Chapel. His\r\nministrations at the prayer-meetings had led to this. For every night\r\non which he was expected to speak, there were more people present than\r\non the last; and when the deacons saw this, they asked him to preach on\r\nthe Sundays. After two Sundays they came to him in a body, and besought\r\nhim to become a candidate for the vacant pulpit, assuring him of\r\nsuccess if he did so. He gave a decided refusal, however, nor mentioned\r\nhis reasons. His friend Marshal urged him, pledging himself for his\r\nincome to an amount which would have been riches to the dominie, but in\r\nvain. Thereupon the silk mercer concluded that he must have money, and,\r\nkind man as he was, grew kinder in consequence, and congratulated him\r\non his independence.\r\n\r\n\u201CI depend more on the fewness of my wants than on any earthly store for\r\nsupplying them,\u201D said the dominie.\r\n\r\nMarshal\u2019s thermometer fell a little, but not his anxiety to secure\r\nservices which, he insisted, would be for the glory of God and the\r\neverlasting good of perishing souls. The schoolmaster only smiled\r\nqueerly and held his peace.\r\n\r\nHe consented, however, to preach the next Sunday, and on the Monday,\r\nconsented to preach the next again. For several weeks the same thing\r\noccurred. But he would never promise on a Sunday, or allow the briefest\r\nadvertisement to be given concerning him. All said he was feeling his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nNeither had he, up to this time, said a word to Malcolm about the\r\nmanner in which his Sundays were employed, while yet he talked much\r\nabout a school he had opened in a room occupied in the evenings by a\r\ndebating club, where he was teaching such children of small shopkeepers\r\nand artisans as found their way to him--in part through his connection\r\nwith the chapel-folk. When Malcolm had called on a Sunday, his landlady\r\nhad been able to tell him nothing more than that Mr Graham had gone out\r\nat such and such an hour--she presumed to church; and when he had once\r\nor twice expressed a wish to accompany him wherever he went to worship,\r\nMr Graham had managed somehow to let him go without having made any\r\narrangement for his doing so.\r\n\r\nOn the evening after his encounter with Liftore, Malcolm visited the\r\nschoolmaster, and told him everything about the affair. He concluded\r\nby saying that Lizzie\u2019s wrongs had loaded the whip far more than his\r\nsister\u2019s insult; but that he was very doubtful whether he had had any\r\nright to constitute himself the avenger of either after such a fashion.\r\nMr Graham replied that a man ought never to be carried away by wrath,\r\nas he had so often sought to impress upon him, and not without success:\r\nbut that, in the present case, as the rascal deserved it so well, he\r\ndid not think he need trouble himself much. At the same time he ought\r\nto remind himself that the rightness or wrongness of any particular act\r\nwas of far less consequence than the rightness or wrongness of the will\r\nwhence sprang the act; and that, while no man could be too anxious as\r\nto whether a contemplated action ought or ought not to be done, at the\r\nsame time no man _could_ do anything absolutely right until he was one\r\nwith him whose was the only absolute self-generated purity --that is,\r\nuntil God dwelt in him and he in God.\r\n\r\nBefore he left, the schoolmaster had acquainted him with all that\r\nportion of his London history which he had hitherto kept from him, and\r\ntold him where he was preaching.\r\n\r\nWhen Caley returned to her mistress after giving Malcolm the message\r\nthat she did not require his services, and reported the condition of\r\nhis face, Florimel informed her of the chastisement he had received\r\nfrom Liftore, and desired her to find out for her how he was, for she\r\nwas anxious about him. Somehow Florimel felt sorrier for him than she\r\ncould well understand, seeing he was but a groom --a great lumbering\r\nfellow, all his life used to hard knocks, which probably never hurt\r\nhim. That her mistress should care so much about him added yet an acrid\r\ntouch to Caley\u2019s spite; but she put on her bonnet and went to the\r\nmews, to confer with the wife of his lordship\u2019s groom, who, although\r\nan honest woman, had not yet come within her dislike. She went to\r\nmake her inquiries, however, full of grave doubt as to his lordship\u2019s\r\nstatement to her mistress; and the result of them was a conviction\r\nthat, beyond his facial bruises, of which Mrs Merton had heard no\r\nexplanation, Malcolm had had no hurt. This confirmed her suspicion\r\nthat his lordship had received what he professed to have given: from\r\na window she had seen him mount his horse; and her woman\u2019s-fancy for\r\nhim; while it added to her hate of Malcolm, did not prevent her from\r\nthinking of the advantage the discovery might bring in the prosecution\r\nof her own schemes. But now she began to fear Malcolm a little as well\r\nas hate him. And indeed he was rather a dangerous person to have about,\r\nwhere all but himself had secrets more or less bad, and one at least\r\nhad dangerous ones--as Caley\u2019s conscience, or what poor monkey-rudiment\r\nin her did duty for one, in private asserted. Notwithstanding her hold\r\nupon her mistress, she would not have felt it quite safe to let her\r\nknow all her secrets. She would not have liked to say, for instance,\r\nhow often she woke suddenly with a little feeble wail sounding in the\r\nears that fingers cannot stop, or to confess that it cried out against\r\na double injustice, that of life and that of death: she had crossed the\r\nborder of the region of horror, and went about with a worm coiled in\r\nher heart, like a centipede in the stone of a peach.\r\n\r\n\u201CMerton\u2019s wife knows nothing, my lady,\u201D she said on her return. \u201CI\r\nsaw the fellow in the yard going about much as usual. He will stand a\r\ngood deal of punishing, I fancy, my lady--like that brute of a horse\r\nhe makes such a fuss with. I can\u2019t help wishing, for your ladyship\u2019s\r\nsake, we had never set eyes on him. He\u2019ll do us all a mischief yet\r\nbefore we get rid of him. I\u2019ve had a hinstinc\u2019 of it, my lady, from the\r\nfirst moment I set eyes on him;\u201D--Caley\u2019s speech was never classic.\r\nWhen she was excited it was low.--\u201CAnd when I \u2019ave a hinstinc\u2019 of\r\nanythink, he\u2019s not a dog as barks for nothink. Mark my words--and I\u2019m\r\nsure I beg your pardon, my lady --but that man will bring shame on the\r\nhouse. He\u2019s that arrergant an\u2019 interferin\u2019 as is certain sure to bring\r\nyour ladyship into public speech an\u2019 a scandal: things will come to be\r\nspoke, my lady, that hadn\u2019t ought to be mentioned. Why, my lady, he\r\nmust ha\u2019 struck his lordship, afore he\u2019d ha\u2019 give him two such black\r\neyes as them! And him that good-natured an\u2019 condescendin\u2019!--I\u2019m sure I\r\ndon\u2019t know what\u2019s to come on it, but your ladyship might cast a thought\r\non the rest of us females as can\u2019t take the liberties of born ladies\r\nwithout sufferin\u2019 for it. Think what the world will say of _us_. It\u2019s\r\nhard, my lady, on the likes of us.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Florimel was not one to be talked into doing what she did not\r\nchoose. Neither would she to her maid render her reasons for not\r\nchoosing. She had repaired her fortifications, strengthened herself\r\nwith Liftore, and was confident.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe fact is, Caley,\u201D she said, \u201CI have fallen in love with Kelpie,\r\nand never mean to part with her--at least till I can ride her --or she\r\nkills me. So I can\u2019t do without MacPhail. And I hope she won\u2019t kill him\r\nbefore he has persuaded her to let me mount her. The man must go with\r\nthe mare. Besides, he is such a strange fellow, if I turned him away I\r\nshould quite expect him to poison her before he left.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe maid\u2019s face grew darker. That her mistress had the slightest\r\nintention of ever mounting that mare she did not find herself fool\r\nenough to believe, but of other reasons she could spy plenty behind.\r\nAnd such there truly were, though none of the sort which Caley\u2019s\r\nimagination, swift to evil, now supplied. The kind of confidence she\r\nreposed in her groom, Caley had no faculty for understanding, and was\r\nthe last person to whom her mistress could impart the fact of her\r\nfather\u2019s leaving her in charge to his young henchman. To the memory of\r\nher father she clung, and so far faithfully that, even now when Malcolm\r\nhad begun to occasion her a feeling of awe and rebuke, she did not the\r\nless confidently regard him as her good genius that he was in danger of\r\nbecoming an unpleasant one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nCONJUNCTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the days passed on, and Florimel heard nothing of Lenorme, the\r\nuneasiness that came with the thought of him gradually diminished, and\r\nall the associations of opposite complexion returned. Untrammelled\r\nby fear, the path into a scaring future seeming to be cut off, her\r\nimagination began to work in the quarry of her late experience, shaping\r\nits dazzling material into gorgeous castles, with foundations deep-dug\r\nin the air, wherein lorded the person and gifts and devotion of the\r\npainter. When lost in such blissful reveries, not seldom moments\r\narrived in which she imagined herself--even felt as if she were\r\ncapable, if not of marrying Lenorme in the flushed face of outraged\r\nsociety, yet of fleeing with him from the judgment of the all but\r\nall-potent divinity to the friendly bosom of some blessed isle of the\r\nsouthern seas, whose empty luxuriance they might change into luxury,\r\nand there living a long harmonious idyll of wedded love, in which\r\nold age and death should be provided against by never taking them\r\ninto account. This mere fancy, which, poor in courage as it was in\r\ninvention, she was far from capable of carrying into effect, yet seemed\r\nto herself the outcome and sign of a whole world of devotion in her\r\nbosom. If one of the meanest of human conditions is conscious heroism,\r\npaltrier yet is heroism before the fact, incapable of self-realization!\r\nBut even the poorest dreaming has its influences, and the result of\r\nhers was that the attentions of Liftore became again distasteful to\r\nher. And no wonder, for indeed his lordship\u2019s presence in the actual\r\nworld made a poor show beside that of the painter in the ideal world\r\nof the woman who, if she could not with truth be said to love him, yet\r\ncertainly had a powerful fancy for him: the mean phrase is good enough,\r\neven although the phantom of Lenorme roused in her all the twilight\r\npoetry of her nature, and the presence of Liftore set her whole\r\nconsciousness in the perpendicular shadowless gas-light of prudence and\r\nself-protection.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure of her castle-building was but seldom interrupted by any\r\nthought of the shamefulness of her behaviour to him. That did not\r\nmatter much! She could so easily make up for all he had suffered! Her\r\nselfishness closed her eyes to her own falsehood. Had she meant it\r\ntruly she would have been right both for him and for herself. To have\r\nrepented and become as noble a creature as Lenorme was capable of\r\nimagining her--not to say as God had designed her, would indeed have\r\nbeen to make up for all he had suffered. But the poor blandishment\r\nshe contemplated as amends, could render him blessed only while its\r\nintoxication blinded him to the fact that it meant nothing of what\r\nit ought to mean, that behind it was no entire, heart-filled woman.\r\nMeantime, as the past, with its delightful imprudences, its trembling\r\njoys, glided away, swiftly widening the space between her and her\r\nfalse fears and shames, and seeming to draw with it the very facts\r\nthemselves, promising to obliterate at length all traces of them,\r\nshe gathered courage; and as the feeling of exposure that had made\r\nthe covert of Liftore\u2019s attentions acceptable, began to yield, her\r\nvariableness began to re-appear, and his lordship to find her uncertain\r\nas ever. Assuredly, as his aunt said, she was yet but a girl incapable\r\nof knowing her own mind, and he must not press his suit. Nor had he\r\nthe spur of jealousy or fear to urge him: society regarded her as his;\r\nand the shadowy repute of the bold-faced countess intercepted some\r\nfavourable rays which would otherwise have fallen upon the young and\r\nbeautiful marchioness from fairer luminaries even than Liftore.\r\n\r\nBut there was one good process, by herself little regarded, going on\r\nin Florimel: notwithstanding the moral discomfort oftener than once\r\noccasioned her by Malcolm, her confidence in him was increasing;\r\nand now that the kind of danger threatening her seemed altered, she\r\nleaned her mind upon him not a little--and more than she could well\r\nhave accounted for to herself on the only grounds she could have\r\nadduced--namely that he was an attendant authorized by her father, and,\r\nlike herself loyal to his memory and will; and that, faithful as a dog,\r\nhe would fly at the throat of anyone who dared touch her--of which she\r\nhad had late proof, supplemented by his silent endurance of consequent\r\nsuffering. Demon sometimes looked angry--when she teased him--had even\r\ngone so far as to bare his teeth; but Malcolm had never shown temper.\r\nIn a matter of imagined duty, he might presume--but that was a small\r\nthing beside the sense of safety his very presence brought with it. She\r\nshuddered indeed at the remembrance of one look he had given her, but\r\nthat had been for no behaviour to himself; and now that the painter\r\nwas gone, she was clear of all temptation to the sort of thing that\r\nhad caused it; and never, never more would she permit herself to be\r\ndrawn into circumstances the least equivocal!--If only Lenorme would\r\ncome back, and allow her to be his friend--his _best_ friend --his only\r\nyoung lady friend, leaving her at perfect liberty to do just as she\r\nliked, then all would be well--absolutely comfortable! In the meantime,\r\nlife was endurable without him--and would be, provided Liftore did not\r\nmake himself disagreeable. If he did, there were other gentlemen who\r\nmight be induced to keep him in check: she would punish him--she knew\r\nhow. She liked him better, however, than any of those.\r\n\r\nIt was out of pure kindness to Malcolm, upon Liftore\u2019s representation\r\nof how he had punished him, that for the rest of the week she dispensed\r\nwith his attendance upon herself. But he, unaware of the lies Liftore\r\nhad told her, and knowing nothing, therefore, of her reason for doing\r\nso, supposed she resented the liberty he had taken in warning her\r\nagainst Caley, feared the breach would go on widening, and went about,\r\nif not quite downcast, yet less hopeful still. Everything seemed going\r\ncounter to his desires. A whole world of work lay before him:--a\r\nharbour to build; a numerous fisher-clan to house as they ought to be\r\nhoused; justice to do on all sides; righteous servants to appoint in\r\nplace of oppressors; and, all over, to show the heavens more just than\r\nhis family had in the past allowed them to appear; he had mortgages\r\nand other debts to pay off--clearing his feet from fetters and his\r\nhands from manacles, that he might be the true lord of his people; he\r\nhad Miss Horn to thank, and the schoolmaster to restore to the souls\r\nand hearts of Portlossie; and, next of all to his sister, he had old\r\nDuncan, his first friend and father, to find and minister to. Not a day\r\npassed, not a night did he lay down his head, without thinking of him.\r\nBut the old man, whatever his hardships, and even the fishermen, with\r\nno harbour to run home to from the wild elements, were in no dangers\r\nto compare with such as threatened his sister. To set her free was his\r\nfirst business, and that business as yet refused to be done. Hence he\r\nwas hemmed in, shut up, incarcerated in stubborn circumstance, from a\r\nlong-reaching range of duties, calling aloud upon his conscience and\r\nheart to hasten with the first, that he might reach the second. What\r\nrendered it the more disheartening was, that, having discovered, as he\r\nhoped, how to compass his first end, the whole possibility had by his\r\nsister\u2019s behaviour, and the consequent disappearance of Lenorme, been\r\nswept from him, leaving him more resourceless than ever.\r\n\r\nWhen Sunday evening came, he found his way to Hope Chapel, and walking\r\nin, was shown to a seat by a grimy-faced pew-opener. It was with\r\nstrange feelings he sat there, thinking of the past, and looking for\r\nthe appearance of his friend on the pulpit-stair. But his feelings\r\nwould have been stranger still had he seen who sat immediately in\r\nthe pew behind him, watching him like a cat watching a mouse, or\r\nrather like a half-grown kitten watching a rat, for she was a little\r\nfrightened at him, even while resolved to have him. But how could she\r\ndoubt her final success, when her plans were already affording her so\r\nmuch more than she had expected? Who would have looked for the great\r\nred stag himself to come browsing so soon about the scarecrow! He was\r\ntoo large game, however, to be stalked without due foresight.\r\n\r\nWhen the congregation was dismissed, after a sermon the power of\r\nwhose utterance astonished Malcolm, accustomed as he was to the\r\nschoolmaster\u2019s best moods, he waited until the preacher was at liberty\r\nfrom the unwelcome attentions and vulgar congratulations of the richer\r\nand more forward of his hearers, and then joined him to walk home\r\nwith him.--He was followed to the schoolmaster\u2019s lodging, and thence,\r\nan hour after, to his own, by a little boy far too little to excite\r\nsuspicion, the grandson of Mrs Catanach\u2019s friend, the herb-doctor.\r\n\r\nUntil now the woman had not known that Malcolm was in London. When she\r\nlearned that he was lodged so near Portland Place, she concluded that\r\nhe was watching his sister, and chuckled over the idea of his being\r\nwatched in turn by herself.\r\n\r\nEvery day for weeks after her declaration concerning the birth of\r\nMalcolm, had the mind of Mrs Catanach been exercised to the utmost to\r\ninvent some mode of undoing her own testimony. She would have had no\r\nscruples, no sense of moral disgust, in eating every one of her words;\r\nbut a magistrate and a lawyer had both been present at the uttering of\r\nthem, and she feared the risk. Malcolm\u2019s behaviour to her after his\r\nfather\u2019s death had embittered the unfriendly feelings she had cherished\r\ntowards him for many years. While she believed him base-born, and was\r\neven ignorant as to his father, she had thought to secure power over\r\nhim for the annoyance of the blind old man to whom she had committed\r\nhim, and whom she hated with the hatred of a wife with whom for the\r\nbest of reasons he had refused to live; but she had found in the boy a\r\nrectitude over which although she had assailed it from his childhood,\r\nshe could gain no influence. Either a blind repugnance in Malcolm\u2019s\r\nsoul, or a childish instinct of and revulsion from embodied evil, had\r\nheld them apart. Even then it had added to her vile indignation that\r\nshe regarded him as owing her gratitude for not having murdered him\r\nat the instigation of his uncle; and when at length, to her endless\r\nchagrin, she had herself unwittingly supplied the only lacking link in\r\nthe testimony that should raise him to rank and wealth, she imagined,\r\nthat by making affidavit to the facts she had already divulged, she\r\nenlarged the obligation infinitely, and might henceforth hold him in\r\nher hand a tool for further operations. When, therefore, he banished\r\nher from Lossie House, and sought to bind her to silence as to his\r\nrank by the conditional promise of a small annuity, she hated him\r\nwith her whole huge power of hating. And now she must make speed, for\r\nhis incognito in a great city afforded a thousandfold facility for\r\ndoing him a mischief. And first she must draw closer a certain loose\r\ntie she had already looped betwixt herself and the household of Lady\r\nBellair. This tie was the conjunction of her lying influence with the\r\ncredulous confidence of a certain very ignorant and rather wickedly\r\nromantic scullery-maid with whom, having in espial seen her come from\r\nthe house she had scraped acquaintance, and to whom, for the securing\r\nof power over her through her imagination, she had made the strangest\r\nand most appalling disclosures. Amongst other secret favours, she\r\nhad promised to compound for her a horrible mixture--some of whose\r\ndisgusting ingredients, as potent as hard to procure, she named in her\r\nawe-stricken hearing--which, administered under certain conditions\r\nand with certain precautions, one of which was absolute secrecy in\r\nregard to the person who provided it, must infallibly secure for her\r\nthe affections of any man on whom she might cast a loving eye, and\r\nwhom she could, either with or without his consent, contrive to cause\r\npartake of the same. This girl she now sought, and from her learned\r\nall she knew about Malcolm. Pursuing her enquiries into the nature and\r\ncomposition of the household, however, Mrs Catanach soon discovered a\r\nfar more capable and indeed less scrupulous associate and instrument in\r\nCaley. I will not introduce my reader to any of their evil councils,\r\nalthough, for the sake of my own credit, it might be well to be less\r\nconsiderate, seeing that many, notwithstanding the super-abundant\r\nevidence of history, find it all but impossible to believe in the\r\nexistence of such moral abandonment as theirs. I will merely state\r\nconcerning them, and all the relations of the two women, that Mrs\r\nCatanach assumed and retained the upper hand, in virtue of her superior\r\nknowledge, invention, and experience, gathering from Caley, as she had\r\nhoped, much valuable information, full of reactions, and tending to\r\norganic development of scheme in the brain of the arch-plotter. But\r\ntheir designs were so mutually favourable as to promise from the first\r\na final coalescence in some common plan for their attainment.\r\n\r\nThose who knew that Miss Campbell, as Portlossie regarded her, had\r\nbeen in reality Lady Lossie, and was the mother of Malcolm, knew as\r\nwell that Florimel had no legal title even to the family cognomen; but\r\nif his mother, and therefore the time of his mother\u2019s death, remained\r\nunknown, the legitimacy of his sister would remain unsuspected even\r\nupon his appearance as the heir. Now there were but three besides Mrs\r\nCatanach and Malcolm who did know who was his mother, namely, Miss\r\nHorn, Mr Graham, and a certain Mr Morrison, a laird and magistrate near\r\nPortlossie, an elderly man, and of late in feeble health. The lawyers\r\nthe marquis had employed on his death-bed did not know: he had, for\r\nFlorimel\u2019s sake taken care that they should not. Upon what she knew\r\nand what she guessed of these facts regarded in all their relations\r\naccording to her own theories of human nature the midwife would found a\r\nscheme of action.\r\n\r\nDoubtless she saw, and prepared for it, that after a certain point\r\nshould be reached the very similarity of their designs must cause a\r\nrupture between her and Caley; neither could expect the other to endure\r\nsuch a rival near her hidden throne of influence; for the aim of both\r\nwas power in a great family, with consequent money, and consideration,\r\nand midnight councils, and the wielding of all the weapons of hint\r\nand threat and insinuation. There was one difference, indeed, that\r\nin Caley\u2019s eye money was the chief thing, while power itself was the\r\nSwedenborgian hell of the midwife\u2019s bliss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nAN INNOCENT PLOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorimel and Lady Clementina Thornicroft, the same who in the park\r\nrebuked Malcolm for his treatment of Kelpie, had met several times\r\nduring the spring, and had been mutually attracted--Florimel as to a\r\nnature larger, more developed, more self-supporting than her own, and\r\nLady Clementina as to one who, it was plain, stood in sore need of what\r\ncountenance and encouragement to good and free action the friendship\r\nof one more experienced might afford her. Lady Clementina was but a\r\nfew years older than Florimel, it is true, but had shown a courage\r\nwhich had already wrought her an unquestionable influence, and that\r\nchiefly with the best. The root of this courage was compassion. Her\r\nrare humanity of heart would, at the slightest appearance of injustice,\r\ndrive her like an angel with a flaming sword against customs regarded,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, as the very buttresses of social\r\ndistinction. Anything but a wise woman, she had yet so much in her of\r\nwhat is essential to all wisdom-- love to her kind--that, if as yet she\r\nhad done little but blunder, she had at least blundered beautifully. On\r\nevery society that had for its declared end the setting right of wrong\r\nor the alleviation of misery, she lavished, and mostly wasted, her\r\nmoney. Every misery took to her the shape of a wrong. Hence to every\r\nmendicant that could trump up a plausible story, she offered herself a\r\nwilling prey. Even when the barest-faced imposition was brought home to\r\none of the race parasitical, her first care was to find all possible\r\nexcuse for his conduct: it was matter of pleasure to her friends when\r\nshe stopped there, and made no attempt at absolute justification.\r\n\r\nLeft like Florimel an orphan, but at a yet earlier age, she had been\r\nbrought up with a care that had gone over into severity, against which\r\nher nature had revolted with an energy that gathered strength from her\r\nown repression of its signs; and when she came of age, and took things\r\ninto her own hands, she carried herself in its eyes so oddly, yet with\r\nsuch sweetness and dignity and consistency in her oddest extravagances,\r\nthat society honoured her even when it laughed at her, loved her,\r\nlistened to her, applauded, approved--did everything except imitate\r\nher--which indeed was just as well, for else confusion would have\r\nbeen worse confounded. She was always rushing to defence--with money,\r\nwith indignation, with refuge. It would look like a caricature did I\r\nrecord the number of charities to which she belonged, and the various\r\nsocieties which, in the exuberance of her passionate benevolence, she\r\nhad projected and of necessity abandoned. Yet still the fire burned,\r\nfor her changes were from no changeableness: through them all the\r\nfundamental operation of her character remained the same. The case was\r\nthat, for all her headlong passion for deliverance, she could not help\r\ndiscovering now and then, through an occasional self-assertion of that\r\nreal good sense which her rampant and unsubjected benevolence could but\r\noverlay, not finally smother, that she was either doing nothing at all,\r\nor more evil than good.\r\n\r\nThe lack of discipline in her goodness came out in this, at times\r\namusingly, that she would always at first side with the lower or weaker\r\nor worse. If a dog had torn a child, and was going to be killed in\r\nconsequence, she would not only intercede for the dog, but absolutely\r\nside with him, mentioning this and that provocation which the naughty\r\nchild must have given him ere he could have been goaded to the deed.\r\nOnce when the schoolmaster in her village was going to cane a boy\r\nfor cruelty to a cripple, she pleaded for his pardon on the ground\r\nthat it was worse to be cruel than to be a cripple, and therefore\r\nmore to be pitied. Everything painful was to her cruel, and softness\r\nand indulgence, moral honey and sugar and nuts to all alike, was the\r\npanacea for human ills. She could not understand that infliction might\r\nbe loving kindness. On one occasion when a boy was caught in the act of\r\npicking her pocket, she told the policeman he was doing nothing of the\r\nsort--he was only searching for a lozenge for his terrible cough; and\r\nin proof of her asserted conviction, she carried him home with her, but\r\nlost him before morning, as well as the spoon with which he had eaten\r\nhis gruel.\r\n\r\nAs to her person I have already made a poor attempt at describing it.\r\nShe might have been grand but for loveliness. When she drew herself up\r\nin indignation, however, she would look grand for the one moment ere\r\nthe blood rose to her cheek, and the water to her eyes. She would have\r\ntaken the whole world to her infinite heart, and in unwisdom coddled it\r\ninto corruption. Praised be the grandeur of the God who can endure to\r\nmake and see his children suffer. Thanks be to him for his north winds\r\nand his poverty, and his bitterness that falls upon the spirit that\r\nerrs: let those who know him thus praise the Lord for his goodness. But\r\nLady Clementina had not yet descried the face of the Son of Man through\r\nthe mists of Mount Sinai, and she was not one to justify the ways of\r\nGod to men. Not the less was it the heart of God in her that drew her\r\nto the young marchioness, over whom was cast the shadow of a tree\r\nthat gave but baneful shelter. She liked her frankness, her activity,\r\nher daring, and fancied that, like herself she was at noble feud with\r\nthat infernal parody of the kingdom of heaven, called Society. She did\r\nnot well understand her relation to Lady Bellair, concerning whom she\r\nwas in doubt whether or not she was her legal guardian, but she saw\r\nplainly enough that the countess wanted to secure her for her nephew,\r\nand this nephew had about him a certain air of perdition, which even\r\nthe catholic heart of Lady Clementina could not brook. She saw too\r\nthat, being a mere girl, and having no scope of choice in the limited\r\ncircle of their visitors, she was in great danger of yielding without\r\na struggle, and she longed to take her in charge like a poor little\r\npersecuted kitten, for the possession of which each of a family of\r\nchildren was contending. What if her father had belonged to a rowdy\r\nset, was that any reason why his innocent daughter should be devoured,\r\nbody and soul and possessions, by those of the same set who had not\r\nyet perished in their sins? Lady Clementina thanked Heaven that she\r\ncame herself of decent people, who paid their debts, dared acknowledge\r\nthemselves in the wrong, and were as honest as if they had been born\r\npeasants; and she hoped a shred of the mantle of their good name had\r\ndropped upon her, big enough to cover also this poor little thing\r\nwho had come of no such parentage. With her passion for redemption\r\ntherefore, she seized every chance of improving her acquaintance with\r\nFlorimel, and it was her anxiety to gain such a standing in her favour\r\nas might further her coveted ministration, that had prevented her\r\nfrom bringing her charge of brutality against Malcolm as soon as she\r\ndiscovered whose groom he was: when she had secured her footing on the\r\npeak of her friendship, she would unburden her soul, and meantime the\r\nhorse must suffer for his mistress--a conclusion in itself a great\r\nstep in advance, for it went dead against one of her most confidently\r\nargued principles, namely, that the pain of any animal is, in every\r\nsense, of just as much consequence as the pain of any other, human or\r\ninferior: pain is pain, she said; and equal pains are equal wherever\r\nthey sting;--in which she would have been right, I think, if pain and\r\nsuffering were the same thing; but, knowing well that the same degree\r\nand even the same kind of pain means two very different things in the\r\nfoot and in the head, I refuse the proposition.\r\n\r\nHappily for Florimel, she had by this time made progress enough to\r\nventure a proposal--namely, that she should accompany her to a small\r\nestate she had on the south coast, with a little ancient house upon\r\nit--a strange place altogether, she said--to spend a week or two in\r\nabsolute quiet--only she must come alone-- without even a maid: she\r\nwould take none herself. This she said because, with the instinct, if\r\nnot quite insight, of a true nature, she could not endure the woman\r\nCaley.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you come with me there for a fortnight?\u201D she concluded.\r\n\r\n\u201CI shall be delighted,\u201D returned Florimel, without a moment\u2019s\r\nhesitation. \u201CI am getting quite sick of London. There\u2019s no room in it.\r\nAnd there\u2019s the spring all outside, and can\u2019t get in here! I shall be\r\nonly too glad to go with you, you dear creature!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd on those hard terms--no maid, you know?\u201D insisted Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe only thing wanted to make the pleasure complete! I shall be\r\ncharmed to be rid of her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am glad to see you so independent.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t imagine me such a baby as not to be able to get on without a\r\nmaid! You should have seen me in Scotland! I hated having a woman about\r\nme then. And indeed I don\u2019t like it a bit better now --only everybody\r\nhas one, and your clothes want looking after,\u201D added Florimel, thinking\r\nwhat a weight it would be off her if she could get rid of Caley\r\naltogether. \u201C--But I _should_ like to take my horse,\u201D she said. \u201CI\r\ndon\u2019t know what I should do in the country without Abbot.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf course; we must have our horses,\u201D returned Clementina. \u201CAnd--\r\nyes--you had better bring your groom.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPlease. You will find him very useful. He can do anything and\r\neverything---and is so kind and helpful!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CExcept to his horse,\u201D Clementina was on the point of saying, but\r\nthought again she would first secure the mistress, and bide her time to\r\nattack the man.\r\n\r\nBefore they parted, the two ladies had talked themselves into ecstasies\r\nover the anticipated enjoyments of their scheme. It must be carried out\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet us tell nobody,\u201D said Lady Clementina, \u201Cand set off to-morrow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEnchanting!\u201D cried Florimel, in full response.\r\n\r\nThen her brow clouded.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is one difficulty, though,\u201D she said. \u201C--No man could ride\r\nKelpie with a led horse; and if we had to employ another, Liftore would\r\nbe sure to hear where we had gone.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat would spoil all,\u201D said Clementina. \u201CBut how much better it would\r\nbe to give that poor creature a rest, and bring the other I see him on\r\nsometimes!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd by the time we came back, there would not be a living creature,\r\nhorse or man, anything bigger than a rat, about the stable. Kelpie\r\nherself would be dead of hunger, if she hadn\u2019t been shot. No, no; where\r\nMalcolm goes Kelpie must go. Besides, she\u2019s such fun--you can\u2019t think!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen I\u2019ll tell you what!\u201D cried Clementina, after a moment\u2019s pause of\r\nperplexity: \u201Cwe\u2019ll _ride_ down! It\u2019s not a hundred miles, and we can\r\ntake as many days on the road as we please.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBetter and better!\u201D cried Florimel. \u201CWe\u2019ll run away with each\r\nother.--But what will dear old Bellair say?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever mind her,\u201D rejoined Clementina. \u201CShe will have nothing to say.\r\nYou can write and tell her as much as will keep her from being really\r\nalarmed. Order your man to get everything ready, and I will instruct\r\nmine. He is such a staid old fellow, you know, he will be quite\r\nprotection. To-morrow morning we shall set out together for a ride in\r\nRichmond Park--that lying in our way. You can leave a letter on the\r\nbreakfast-table, saying you are gone with me for a little quiet. You\u2019re\r\nnot in chancery--are you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D answered Florimel. \u201CI suppose I\u2019m all right.-- Any how,\r\nwhether I\u2019m in chancery or not, here I am, and going with you; and if\r\nchancery don\u2019t like it, chancery may come and fetch me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSend anything you think you may want to my house. I shall get a box\r\nready, and we will write from some town on our way to have it sent\r\nthere, and then we can write for it from The Gloom. We shall find all\r\nmere _necessaries_ there.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the thing was arranged: they would start quite early the next\r\nmorning; and that there might be no trouble in the streets, Malcolm\r\nshould go before with Kelpie, and wait them in the park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMalcolm was overjoyed at the prospect of an escape to the country --and\r\nyet more to find that his mistress wanted to have him with her--more\r\nstill to understand, that the journey was to be kept a secret. Perhaps\r\nnow, far from both Caley and Liftore, he might say something to open\r\nher eyes; yet how should he avoid the appearance of a tale-bearer?\r\n\r\nIt was a sweet fresh morning, late in the spring--those loveliest of\r\nhours that unite the seasons, like the shimmering question of green\r\nor blue in the feathers of a peacock. He had set out an hour before\r\nthe rest, and now, a little way within the park, was coaxing Kelpie\r\nto stand, that he might taste the morning in peace. The sun was but\r\na few degrees above the horizon, shining with all his heart, and the\r\nearth was taking the shine with all hers. \u201CI too am light,\u201D she was\r\nsaying, \u201Calthough I can but receive it.\u201D The trees were covered with\r\nbaby-leaves, half wrapped in their swaddling clothes, and their breath\r\nwas a warm aromatic odour in the glittering air. The air and the light\r\nseemed one, and Malcolm felt as if his soul were breathing the light\r\ninto its very depths, while his body was drinking the soft spicy wind.\r\nFor Kelpie, she was as full of life as if she had been meant for a\r\nwinged horse, but by some accident of nature the wing-cases had never\r\nopened, and the wing-life was for ever trying to get out at her feet.\r\nThe consequent restlessness, where there was plenty of space as here,\r\ncaused Malcolm no more discomposure than, in his old fishing-days,\r\na gale with plenty of sea-room. And the song of the larks was one\r\nwith the light and the air. The budding of the trees was their way\r\nof singing; but the larks beat them at that. \u201CWhat a power of joy,\u201D\r\nthought Malcolm, \u201Cthere must be in God, to be able to keep so many\r\nlarks so full of bliss!\u201D He was going to say--\u201Cwithout getting tired;\u201D\r\nbut he saw that it was the eternal joy itself that bubbled from their\r\nlittle fountains: weariness there would be the silence of all song,\r\nwould be death, utter vanishment to the gladness of the universe. The\r\nsun would go out like a spark upon burnt paper, and the heart of man\r\nwould forget the sound of laughter. Then he said to himself: \u201CThe larks\r\ndo not make their own singing; do mortals make their own sighing?\u201D And\r\nhe saw that at least they might open wider the doors of their hearts\r\nto the Perseus Joy that comes to slay the grief-monsters. Then he\r\nthought how his life had been widening out with the years. He could not\r\nsay that it was now more pleasant than it had been; he had Stoicism\r\nenough to doubt whether it would ever become so from any mere change\r\nof circumstances. Dangers and sufferings that one is able for, are not\r\nmisfortunes or even hardships--so far from such, that youth delights\r\nin them. Indeed he sorely missed the adventure of the herring fishing.\r\nKelpie, however, was as good as a stiff gale. If only all were well\r\nwith his sister! Then he would go back to Portlossie and have fishing\r\nenough. But he must be patient and follow as he was led. At three and\r\ntwenty, he reflected, Milton was content to seem to himself but a poor\r\ncreature, and was careful only to be ready for whatever work should\r\nhereafter be required of him: such contentment, with such hope and\r\nresolve at the back of it, he saw to be the right and the duty both of\r\nevery man. He whose ambition is to be ready when he is wanted, whatever\r\nthe work may be, may wait not the less watchful that he is content. His\r\nheart grew lighter, his head clearer, and by the time the two ladies\r\nwith their attendant appeared, he felt such a masterdom over Kelpie as\r\nhe had never felt before.\r\n\r\nThey rode twenty miles that day with ease, putting up at the first\r\ntown. The next day they rode about the same distance. They next day\r\nthey rode nearly thirty miles. On the fourth, with an early start, and\r\na good rest in the middle, they accomplished a yet greater distance,\r\nand at night arrived at The Gloom, Wastbeach--after a journey of\r\ncontinuous delight to three at least of the party, Florimel and Malcolm\r\nhaving especially enjoyed that portion of it which led through Surrey,\r\nwhere England and Scotland meet and mingle in waste, heathery moor, and\r\nrich valley. Much talk had passed between the ladies, and Florimel had\r\nbeen set thinking about many things, though certainly about none after\r\nthe wisest fashion.\r\n\r\nA young half-moon was still up when, after riding miles through pine\r\nwoods, they at length drew near the house. Long before they reached it,\r\nhowever, a confused noise of dogs met them in the forest. Clementina\r\nhad written to the housekeeper, and every dog about the place, and the\r\ndogs were multitudinous, had been expecting her all day, had heard\r\nthe sound of their horses\u2019 hoofs miles off and had at once begun\r\nto announce her approach. Nor were the dogs the only cognisant or\r\nexpectant animals. Most of the creatures about the place understood\r\nthat something was happening, and probably associated it with their\r\nmistress; for almost every live thing knew her--from the rheumatic\r\ncart-horse, forty years of age, and every whit as respectable in\r\nClementina\u2019s eyes as her father\u2019s old butler, to the wild cats that\r\nhaunted the lofts and garrets of the old Elizabethan hunting-lodge.\r\n\r\nWhen they dismounted, the ladies could hardly get into the house for\r\ndogs; those which could not reach their mistress, turned to Florimel,\r\nand came swarming about her and leaping upon her, until, much as she\r\nliked animal favour, she would gladly have used her whip--but dared\r\nnot, because of the presence of their mistress. If the theories of that\r\nmistress allowed them anything of a moral nature, she was certainly\r\nculpable in refusing them their right to a few cuts of the whip.\r\n\r\nMingled with all the noises of dogs and horses, came a soft nestling\r\nmurmur that filled up the interspaces of sound which even their\r\ntumult could not help leaving. Florimel was too tired to hear it, but\r\nMalcolm heard it, and it filled all the interspaces of his soul with a\r\nspeechless delight. He knew it for the still small voice of the awful\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nFlorimel scarcely cast a glance around the dark old-fashioned room\r\ninto which she was shown, but went at once to bed, and when the old\r\nhousekeeper carried her something from the supper-table at which she\r\nhad been expected, she found her already fast asleep. By the time\r\nMalcolm had put Kelpie to rest, he also was a little tired, and lay\r\nawake no moment longer than his sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nDISCIPLINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat with rats and mice, and cats and owls, and creaks and cracks,\r\nthere was no quiet about the place from night to morning; and what with\r\nswallows and rooks, and cocks and kine, and horses and foals, and dogs\r\nand pigeons and peacocks, and guinea-fowls and turkeys and geese, and\r\nevery farm creature but pigs, which, with all her zootrophy, Clementina\r\ndid not like, no quiet from morning to night. But if there was no\r\nquiet, there was plenty of calm, and the sleep of neither brother nor\r\nsister was disturbed.\r\n\r\nFlorimel awoke in the sweetest concert of pigeon-murmuring,\r\nduck-diplomacy, fowl-foraging, foal-whinnering--the word wants an _r_\r\nin it--and all the noises of rural life. The sun was shining into the\r\nroom by a window far off at the further end, bringing with him strange\r\nsylvan shadows, not at once to be interpreted. He must have been\r\nshining for hours, so bright and steady did he shine. She sprang out of\r\nbed--with no lazy London resurrection of the old buried, half-sodden\r\ncorpse, sleepy and ashamed, but with the new birth of the new day,\r\nrefreshed and strong, like a Hercules-baby. A few aching remnants of\r\nstiffness was all that was left of the old fatigue. It was a heavenly\r\njoy to think that no Caley would come knocking at her door. She glided\r\ndown the long room to the sunny window, drew aside the rich old faded\r\ncurtain, and peeped out. Nothing but pines and pines--Scotch firs all\r\nabout and everywhere! They came within a few yards of the window. She\r\nthrew it open. The air was still, the morning sun shone hot upon them,\r\nand the resinous odour exhaled from their bark and their needles and\r\ntheir fresh buds, filled the room--sweet and clean. There was nothing,\r\nnot even a fence, between this wing of the house and the wood.\r\n\r\nAll through his deep sleep, Malcolm heard the sound of the sea\r\n--whether of the phantom sea in his soul, or of the world-sea to whose\r\nmurmurs he had listened with such soft delight as he fell asleep,\r\nmatters little: the sea was with him in his dreams. But when he awoke\r\nit was to no musical crushing of water-drops, no half-articulated tones\r\nof animal speech, but to tumult and out-cry from the stables. It was\r\nbut too plain that he was wanted. Either Kelpie had waked too soon,\r\nor he had overslept himself: she was kicking furiously. Hurriedly\r\ninduing a portion of his clothing, he rushed down and across the yard,\r\nshouting to her as he ran, like a nurse as she runs up the stair to a\r\nscreaming child. She stopped once to give an eager whinny, and then\r\nfell to again. Griffiths, the groom, and the few other men about the\r\nplace, were looking on appalled. He darted to the corn-bin, got a\r\ngreat pottleful of oats, and shot into her stall. She buried her nose\r\nin them like the very demon of hunger, and he left her for the few\r\nmoments of peace that would follow. He must finish his dressing as\r\nfast as he could: already, after four days of travel, which with her\r\nmeant anything but a straight-forward jog-trot struggle with space, she\r\nneeded a good gallop! When he returned, he found her just finishing\r\nher oats, and beginning to grow angry with her own nose for getting\r\nso near the bottom of the manger. While yet there was no worse sign,\r\nhowever, than the fidgetting of her hind quarters, and she was still\r\nbusy, he made haste to saddle her. But her unusually obstinate refusal\r\nof the bit, and his difficulty in making her open her unwilling jaws,\r\ngave unmistakable indication of coming conflict. Anxiously he asked the\r\nbystanders after some open place where he might let her go--fields or\r\ntolerably smooth heath, or sandy beach. He dared not take her through\r\nthe trees, he said, while she was in such a humour; she would dash\r\nherself to pieces. They told him there was a road straight from the\r\nstables to the shore, and there miles of pure sand without a pebble.\r\nNothing could be better. He mounted and rode away.\r\n\r\nFlorimel was yet but half-dressed, when the door of her room opened\r\nsuddenly, and Lady Clementina darted in--the lovely chaos of her night\r\nnot more than half as far reduced to order as that of Florimel\u2019s.\r\nHer moonlight hair, nearly as long as that of the fabled Godiva, was\r\nflung wildly about her in heavy masses. Her eyes were wild also; she\r\nlooked like a holy Maenad. With a glide like the swoop of an avenging\r\nangel, she pounced upon Florimel, caught her by the wrist and pulled\r\nher towards the door. Florimel was startled, but made no resistance.\r\nShe half led, half dragged her up a stair that rose from a corner of\r\nthe hall gallery to the battlements of a little square tower, whence\r\na few yards of the beach, through a chain of slight openings amongst\r\nthe pines, was visible. Upon that spot of beach, a strange thing was\r\ngoing on--at which afresh Clementina gazed with indignant horror, but\r\nFlorimel eagerly stared with the forward-borne eyes of a spectator of\r\nthe Roman arena. She saw Kelpie reared on end, striking out at Malcolm\r\nwith her fore-hoofs, and snapping with angry teeth--then upon those\r\nteeth receive such a blow from his fist that she swerved, and wheeling,\r\nflung her hind hoofs at his head. But Malcolm was too quick for her;\r\nshe spent her heels in the air, and he had her by the bit. Again she\r\nreared, and would have struck at him, but he kept well by her side, and\r\nwith the powerful bit forced her to rear to her full height. Just as\r\nshe was falling backwards, he pushed her head from him, and bearing her\r\ndown sideways, seated himself on it the moment it touched the ground.\r\nThen first the two women turned to each other. An arch of victory bowed\r\nFlorimel\u2019s lip; her eyebrows were uplifted; the blood flushed her\r\ncheek, and darkened the blue in her wide opened eyes. Lady Clementina\u2019s\r\nforehead was gathered in vertical wrinkles over her nose, and all\r\nabout her eyes was contracted as if squeezing from them the flame of\r\nindignation, while her teeth and lips were firmly closed. The two made\r\na splendid contrast. When Clementina\u2019s gaze fell on her visitor, the\r\nfire in her eyes burned more angry still: her soul was stirred by the\r\npresence of wrong and cruelty, and here, her guest, and looking her\r\nstraight in the eyes, was a young woman, one word from whom would stop\r\nit all, actually enjoying the sight!\r\n\r\n\u201CLady Lossie, I am ashamed of you!\u201D she said, with severest reproof;\r\nand turning from her, she ran down the stair.\r\n\r\nFlorimel turned again towards the sea. Presently she caught sight\r\nof Clementina glimpsing though the pines, \u201Cnow in glimmer and now\r\nin gloom,\u201D as she sped swiftly to the shore, and, after a few short\r\nminutes of disappearance, saw her emerge upon the space of sand where\r\nsat Malcolm on the head of the demoness. But alas! she could only see.\r\nShe could hardly even hear the sound of the tide.\r\n\r\n\u201CMacPhail, are you a man?\u201D cried Clementina, startling him so that in\r\nanother instant the floundering mare would have been on her feet. With\r\na right noble anger in her face, and her hair flying like a wind-torn\r\ncloud, she rushed out of the wood upon him, where he sat quietly\r\ntracing a proposition of Euclid on the sand with his whip.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, and a bold one,\u201D was on Malcolm\u2019s lips for reply, but he bethought\r\nhimself in time.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am sorry what I am compelled to do should annoy your ladyship,\u201D he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nWhat with indignation and breathlessness--she had run so fast--\r\nClementina had exhausted herself in that one exclamation, and stood\r\npanting and staring. The black bulk of Kelpie lay outstretched on\r\nthe yellow sand, giving now and then a sprawling kick or a wamble\r\nlike a lumpy snake, and her soul commiserated each movement as if it\r\nhad been the last throe of dissolution, while the grey fire of the\r\nmare\u2019s one-visible fierce eye, turned up from the shadow of Malcolm\u2019s\r\nsuperimposed bulk, seemed to her tender heart a mute appeal for woman\u2019s\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nAs Malcolm spoke, he cautiously shifted his position, and, half-rising,\r\nknelt with one knee where he had sat before, looking observant at Lady\r\nClementina. The champion of oppressed animality soon recovered speech.\r\n\r\n\u201CGet off the poor creature\u2019s head instantly,\u201D she said, with dignified\r\ncommand. \u201CI will permit no such usage of living thing on my ground.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am very sorry to seem rude, my lady,\u201D answered Malcolm, \u201Cbut to obey\r\nyou would perhaps be to ruin my mistress\u2019s property. If the mare were\r\nto break away, she would dash herself to pieces in the wood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou have goaded her to madness.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m the more bound to take care of her then,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CBut\r\nindeed it is only temper--such temper, however, that I almost believe\r\nshe is at times possessed of a demon.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe demon is in yourself. There is nothing in her but what your\r\ncruelty has put there. Let her up, I command you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI dare not, my lady. If she were to get loose she would tear your\r\nladyship to pieces.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will take my chance.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I will not my lady. I know the danger, and have to take care of\r\nyou who do not. There is no occasion to be uneasy about the mare. She\r\nis tolerably comfortable. I am not hurting her--not much. Your ladyship\r\ndoes not reflect how strong a horse\u2019s skull is. And you see what great\r\npowerful breaths she draws!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe is in agony,\u201D cried Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot in the least, my lady. She is only balked of her own way, and does\r\nnot like it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what right have you to balk her of her own way? Has she no right\r\nto a mind of her own?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe may of course have her mind, but she can\u2019t have her way. She has\r\ngot a master.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what right have you to be her master?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat my master, my Lord Lossie, gave me the charge of her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t mean that sort of right; that goes for nothing. What right in\r\nthe nature of things can you have to tyrannize over any creature?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNone, my lady. But the higher nature has the right to rule the lower\r\nin righteousness. Even you can\u2019t have your own way always, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI certainly cannot now, so long as you keep in that position. Pray, is\r\nit in virtue of _your_ being the higher nature that you keep _my_ way\r\nfrom _me_?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, my lady. But it is in virtue of right. If I wanted to take your\r\nladyship\u2019s property, your dogs would be justified in refusing me my\r\nway.--I do not think I exaggerate when I say that, if my mare here had\r\n_her_ way, there would not be a living creature about your house by\r\nthis day week.\u201D\r\n\r\nLady Clementina had never yet felt upon her the power of a stronger\r\nnature than her own. She had had to yield to authority, but never to\r\nsuperiority. Hence her self-will had been abnormally developed. Her\r\nvery compassion was self-willed. Now for the first time, she continuing\r\naltogether unaware of it, the presence of such a nature began to\r\noperate upon her. The calmness of Malcolm\u2019s speech and the immovable\r\ndecision of his behaviour told.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut,\u201D she said, more calmly, \u201Cyour mare has had four long journeys,\r\nand she should have rested to-day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CRest is just the one thing beyond her, my lady. There is a volcano of\r\nlife and strength in her you have no conception of. I could not have\r\ndreamed of horse like her. She has never in her life had enough to do.\r\nI believe that is the chief trouble with her. What we all want, my\r\nlady, is a master--a real right master. I\u2019ve got one myself; and--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou mean you want one yourself,\u201D said Lady Clementina. \u201CYou\u2019ve only\r\ngot a mistress, and she spoils you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is not what I meant, my lady,\u201D returned Malcolm. \u201CBut one thing\r\nI know, is that Kelpie would soon come to grief without me. I shall\r\nkeep her here till her half-hour is out, and then let her take another\r\ngallop.\u201D\r\n\r\nLady Clementina turned away. She was defeated. Malcolm knelt there\r\non one knee, with a hand on the mare\u2019s shoulder, so calm, so\r\nimperturbable, so ridiculously full of argument, that there was nothing\r\nmore for her to do or say. Indignation, expostulation, were powerless\r\nupon him as mist upon a rock. He was the oddest, most incomprehensible\r\nof grooms.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the house, she met Florimel, and turned again with her to\r\nthe scene of discipline. Ere they reached it, Florimel\u2019s delight with\r\nall around her had done something to restore Clementina\u2019s composure:\r\nthe place was precious to her, for there she had passed nearly the\r\nwhole of her childhood. But to anyone with a heart open to the\r\nexpressions of Nature\u2019s countenance, the place could not but have a\r\nstrange as well as peculiar charm.\r\n\r\nFlorimel had lost her way. I would rather it had been in the moonlight,\r\nbut slant sunlight was next best. It shone through a slender multitude\r\nof mast-like stems, whose shadows complicated the wonder, while the\r\nlight seemed amongst them to have gathered to itself properties\r\nappreciable by other organs besides the eyes, and to dwell bodily\r\nwith the trees. The soil was mainly of sand, the soil to delight the\r\nlong tap-roots of the fir-trees, covered above with a thick layer of\r\nslow-forming mould, in the gradual odoriferous decay of needles and\r\ncones and flakes of bark and knots of resinous exudation. It grew\r\nlooser and sandier, and its upper coat thinner, as she approached\r\nthe shore. The trees shrunk in size, stood farther apart, and grew\r\nmore individual, sending out knarled boughs on all sides of them, and\r\nasserting themselves as the tall slender branchless ones in the social\r\nrestraint of the thicker wood dared not do. They thinned and thinned,\r\nand the sea and the shore came shining through, for the ground sloped\r\nto the beach without any intervening abruption of cliff or even bank;\r\nthey thinned and thinned until all were gone, and the bare long yellow\r\nsands lay stretched out on both sides for miles, gleaming and sparkling\r\nin the sun, especially at one spot where the water of a little stream\r\nwandered about over them, as if it had at length found its home, but\r\nwas too weary to enter and lose its weariness, and must wait for the\r\ntide to come up and take it. But when Florimel reached the strand, she\r\ncould see nothing of the group she sought: the shore took a little\r\nbend, and a tongue of forest came in between.\r\n\r\nShe was on her way back to the house when she met Clementina, also\r\nreturning discomfited. Pleased as she was with them, her hostess soon\r\ninterrupted her ecstasies by breaking out in accusation of Malcolm, not\r\nuntempered, however, with a touch of dawning respect. At the same time\r\nher report of his words was anything but accurate, for as no one can be\r\njust without love, so no one can truly report without understanding.\r\nBut they had not time to discuss him now, as Clementina insisted on\r\nFlorimel\u2019s putting an immediate stop to his cruelty.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the spot, there was the groom again seated on his\r\nanimal\u2019s head, with a new proposition in the sand before him.\r\n\r\n\u201CMalcolm,\u201D said his mistress, \u201Clet the mare get up. You must let her\r\noff the rest of her punishment this time.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm rose again to his knee.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, my lady,\u201D he said. \u201CBut perhaps your ladyship wouldn\u2019t mind\r\nhelping me to unbuckle her girths before she gets to her feet. I want\r\nto give her a bath.--Come to this side,\u201D he went on, as Florimel\r\nadvanced to his request, \u201C--round here by her head. If your ladyship\r\nwould kneel upon it, that would be best. But you mustn\u2019t move till I\r\ntell you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will do anything you bid me--exactly as you say, Malcolm,\u201D responded\r\nFlorimel.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s the Colonsay blood! I can trust that!\u201D cried Malcolm, with\r\na pardonable outbreak of pride in his family. Whether most of his\r\nancestors could so well have appreciated the courage of obedience, is\r\nnot very doubtful.\r\n\r\nClementina was shocked at the insolent familiarity of her poor little\r\nfriend\u2019s groom, but Florimel saw none, and kneeled, as if she had been\r\nin church, on the head of the mare, with the fierce crater of her fiery\r\nbrain blazing at her knee. Then Malcolm lifted the flap of the saddle,\r\nundid the buckles of the girths, and drawing them a little from under\r\nher, laid the saddle on the sand, talking all the time to Florimel,\r\nlest a sudden word might seem a direction, and she should rise before\r\nthe right moment had come.\r\n\r\n\u201CPlease, my lady Clementina, will you go to the edge of the wood.\r\nI can\u2019t tell what she may do when she gets up. And please, my lady\r\nFlorimel, will you run there too, the moment you get off her head.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen he got her rid of the saddle, he gathered the reins together in\r\nhis bridle hand, took his whip in the other, and softly and carefully\r\nstraddled across her huge barrel without touching her.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, my lady!\u201D he said. \u201CRun for the wood.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel rose and fled, heard a great scrambling behind her, and\r\nturning at the first tree, which was only a few yards off, saw Kelpie\r\non her hind legs, and Malcolm, whom she had lifted with her, sticking\r\nby his knees on her bare back. The moment her fore feet touched the\r\nground, he gave her the spur severely, and after one plunging kick,\r\noff they went westward over the sands, away from the sun; nor did they\r\nturn before they had dwindled to such a speck that the ladies could not\r\nhave told by their eyes whether it was moving or not. At length they\r\nsaw it swerve a little; by and by it began to grow larger; and after\r\nanother moment or two they could distinguish what it was, tearing along\r\ntowards them like a whirlwind, the lumps of wet sand flying behind like\r\nan upward storm of clods. What a picture it was!--only neither of the\r\nladies was calm enough to see it picturewise: the still sea before,\r\ntype of the infinite always, and now of its repose; the still straight\r\nsolemn wood behind, like a past world that had gone to sleep--out of\r\nwhich the sand seemed to come flowing down, to settle in the long\r\nsand-lake of the beach; that flameless furnace of life tearing along\r\nthe shore, betwixt the sea and the land, between time and eternity,\r\nguided, but only half controlled, by the strength of a higher will;\r\nand the two angels that had issued--whether out of the forest of the\r\npast or the sea of the future, who could tell?--and now stood, with\r\nhand-shaded eyes, gazing upon that fierce apparition of terrene life.\r\n\r\nAs he came in front of them, Malcolm suddenly wheeled Kelpie, so\r\nsuddenly and in so sharp a curve that he made her \u201Cturne close to the\r\nground, like a cat, when scratchingly she wheeles about after a mouse,\u201D\r\nas Sir Philip Sidney says, and dashed her straight into the sea. The\r\ntwo ladies gave a cry, Florimel of delight, Clementina of dismay, for\r\nshe knew the coast, and that there it shelved suddenly into deep water.\r\nBut that was only the better to Malcolm: it was the deep water he\r\nsought, though he got it with a little pitch sooner than he expected.\r\nHe had often ridden Kelpie into the sea at Portlossie, even in the cold\r\nautumn weather when first she came into his charge, and nothing pleased\r\nher better or quieted her more. He was a heavy weight to swim with, but\r\nshe displaced much water. She carried her head bravely, he balanced\r\nsideways, and they swam splendidly. To the eyes of Clementina the mare\r\nseemed to be labouring for her life.\r\n\r\nWhen Malcolm thought she had had enough of it, he turned her head to\r\nthe shore. But then came the difficulty. So steeply did the shore\r\nshelve that Kelpie could not get a hold with her hind hoofs to scramble\r\nup into the shallow water. The ladies saw the struggle, and Clementina,\r\nunderstanding it, was running in an agony right into the water, with\r\nthe vain idea of helping them, when Malcolm threw himself off, drawing\r\nthe reins over Kelpie\u2019s head as he fell, and swimming but the length\r\nof them shorewards, felt the ground with his feet, and stood, Kelpie,\r\nrelieved of his weight, floated a little farther on to the shelf, got\r\na better hold with her fore feet, some hold with her hind ones, and\r\nwas beside him in a moment. The same moment Malcolm was on her back\r\nagain, and they were tearing off eastward at full stretch. So far did\r\nthe lessening point recede in the narrowing distance, that the two\r\nladies sat down on the sand, and fell a-talking about Florimel\u2019s most\r\nuncategorical groom, as Clementina, herself the most uncategorical of\r\nwomen, to use her own scarcely justifiable epithet, called him. She\r\nasked if such persons abounded in Scotland. Florimel could but answer\r\nthat this was the only one she had met with. Then she told her about\r\nRichmond Park and Lord Liftore and Epictetus.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, that accounts for him!\u201D said Clementina. \u201CEpictetus was a Cynic, a\r\nvery cruel man: he broke his slave\u2019s leg once, I remember.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMr Lenorme told me that _he_ was the slave, and that his master broke\r\n_his_ leg,\u201D said Florimel.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, yes! I daresay.--That _was_ it. But it is of little consequence:\r\nhis principles were severe, and your groom has been his too ready\r\npupil. It is a pity he is such a savage: he might be quite an\r\ninteresting character.--Can he read?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have just told you of his reading Greek over Kelpie\u2019s head,\u201D said\r\nFlorimel, laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! but I meant English,\u201D said Clementina, whose thoughts were a\r\nlittle astray. Then laughing at herself she explained:--\u201CI mean, can he\r\nread aloud? I put the last of the Waverley novels in the box we shall\r\nhave to-morrow, or the next day at latest, I hope: and I was wondering\r\nwhether he could read the Scotch--as it ought to be read. I have never\r\nheard it spoken, and I don\u2019t know how to imagine it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe can try him,\u201D said Florimel. \u201CIt will be great fun anyhow. He is\r\n_such_ a character! You will be _so_ amused with the remarks he will\r\nmake!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut can you venture to let him talk to you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you ask him to read, how will you prevent him? Unfortunately he has\r\nthoughts, and they _will_ out.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs there no danger of his being rude?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf speaking his mind about anything in the book be rudeness, he will\r\nmost likely be rude. Any other kind of rudeness is as impossible to\r\nMalcolm as to any gentleman in the land.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow can you be so sure of him?\u201D said Clementina, a little anxious as\r\nto the way in which her friend regarded the young man.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy father was--yes, I may say so--attached to him--so much so that\r\nhe--I can\u2019t quite say what--but something like made him promise never\r\nto leave my service. And this I know for myself, that not once, ever\r\nsince that man came to us, has he done a selfish thing or one to be\r\nashamed of. I could give you proof after proof of his devotion.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel\u2019s warmth did not reassure Clementina; and her uneasiness\r\nwrought to the prejudice of Malcolm. She was never quite so generous\r\ntowards human beings as towards animals. She could not be depended on\r\nfor justice except to people in trouble, and then she was very apt to\r\nbe unjust to those who troubled them.\r\n\r\n\u201CI would not have you place too much confidence in your Admirable\r\nCrichton of menials, Florimel,\u201D she said. \u201CThere is something about him\r\nI cannot get at the bottom of. Depend upon it, a man who can be cruel\r\nwould betray on the least provocation.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel smiled superior--as she had good reason to do; but Clementina\r\ndid not understand the smile, and therefore did not like it. She\r\nfeared the young fellow had already gained too much influence over his\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\n\u201CFlorimel, my love,\u201D she said, \u201Clisten to me. Your experience is not so\r\nripe as mine. That man is not what you think him. One day or other he\r\nwill, I fear, make himself worse than disagreeable. How _can_ a cruel\r\nman be unselfish?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think him cruel at all. But then I haven\u2019t such a soft heart\r\nfor animals as you. We should think it silly in Scotland. You wouldn\u2019t\r\nteach a dog manners at the expense of a howl. You would let him be a\r\nnuisance rather than give him a cut with a whip. What a nice mother of\r\nchildren you will make, Clementina! That\u2019s how the children of good\r\npeople are so often a disgrace to them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are like all the rest of the Scotch I ever knew,\u201D said Lady\r\nClementina: \u201Cthe Scotch are always preaching! I believe it is in their\r\nblood. You are a nation of parsons. Thank goodness! my morals go no\r\nfarther than doing as I would be done by. I want to see creatures happy\r\nabout me. For my own sake even, I would never cause pang to person--it\r\ngives me such a pang myself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s the way you are made, I suppose, Clementina,\u201D returned\r\nFlorimel. \u201CFor me, my clay must be coarser. I don\u2019t mind a little pain\r\nmyself, and I can\u2019t break my heart for it when I see it-- except it\r\nbe very bad--such as I should care about myself.--But here comes the\r\ntyrant.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm was pulling up his mare some hundred yards off. Even now she\r\nwas unwilling to stop--but it was at last only from pure original\r\nobjection to whatever was wanted of her. When she did stand she stood\r\nstock still, breathing hard.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have actually succeeded in taking a little out of her at last, my\r\nlady,\u201D said Malcolm as he dismounted. \u201CHave you got a bit of sugar in\r\nyour pocket, my lady? She would take it quite gently now.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel had none, but Clementina had, for she always carried sugar for\r\nher horse. Malcolm held the demoness very watchfully, but she took the\r\nsugar from Florimel\u2019s palm as neatly as an elephant, and let her stroke\r\nher nose over her wide red nostrils without showing the least of her\r\nusual inclination to punish a liberty with death. Then Malcolm rode\r\nher home, and she was at peace till the evening --when he took her out\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nMOONLIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now followed a pleasant time. Wastbeach was the quietest of all\r\nquiet neighbourhoods; it was the loveliest of spring-summer weather;\r\nand the variety of scenery on moor, in woodland, and on coast, within\r\neasy reach of such good horse-women, was wonderful. The first day they\r\nrested the horses that would rest, but the next day were in the saddle\r\nimmediately after an early breakfast. They took the forest way. In many\r\ndirections were tolerably smooth rides cut, and along them they had\r\ngood gallops, to the great delight of Florimel after the restraints\r\nof Rotten Row, where riding had seemed like dancing a minuet with a\r\nwaltz in her heart. Malcolm, so far as human companionship went, found\r\nit dull, for Lady Clementina\u2019s groom regarded him with the contempt\r\nof superior age, the most contemptible contempt of all, seeing years\r\nare not the wisdom they ought to bring, and the first sign of that is\r\nmodesty. Again and again his remarks tempted Malcolm to incite him to\r\nride Kelpie, but conscience, the thought of the man\u2019s family, and the\r\nremembrance that it required all his youthful strength, and that it\r\nwould therefore be the challenge of the strong to the weak, saved him\r\nfrom the sin, and he schooled himself to the endurance of middle-aged\r\narrogance. For the learning of the lesson he had practice enough: they\r\nrode every day, and Griffith did not thaw; but the one thundering\r\ngallop he had every morning along the sands with Kelpie, whom[1]\r\nno ordinary day\u2019s work was enough to save from the heart-burning\r\nferment of repressed activity, was both preparation and amends for the\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: According to the grammars, I ought to have written\r\n_which_, but it will not do. I could, I think, tell why, but prefer\r\nleaving the question to the reader.]\r\n\r\nWhen his mistress mentioned the proposal of her friend with regard\r\nto the new novel, he at once expressed his willingness to attempt\r\ncompliance, fearing only, he said, that his English would prove\r\noffensive and his Scotch unintelligible. The task was nowise alarming\r\nto him, for he had read aloud much to the schoolmaster, who had also\r\ninsisted that he should read aloud when alone, especially verse,\r\nin order that he might get all the good of its outside as well as\r\ninside--its sound as well as thought, the one being the ethereal body\r\nof the other. And he had the best primary qualifications for the art,\r\nnamely, a delight in the sounds of human speech, a value for the true\r\nembodiment of thought, and a good ear, mental as well as vocal, for the\r\nassimilation of sound to sense. After these came the quite secondary,\r\nyet valuable gift of a pleasant voice, manageable for reflection; and\r\nwith such an outfit, the peculiarities of his country\u2019s utterance, the\r\nlong-drawn vowels, and the outbreak of feeling in chant-like tones\r\nand modulations, might be forgiven, and certainly were forgiven by\r\nLady Clementina, who, even in his presence, took his part against the\r\nobjections of his mistress. On the whole, they were so much pleased\r\nwith his first reading, which took place the very day the box arrived,\r\nthat they concluded to restrain the curiosity of their interest in\r\npersons and events, for the sake of the pleasure of meeting them always\r\nin the final fulness of local colour afforded them by his utterance.\r\nWhile he read, they busied their fingers with their embroidery; for\r\nas yet that graceful work, so lovelily described by Cowper in his\r\n_Task_, had not begun to vanish before the crude colours and mechanical\r\nvulgarity of Berlin wool, now happily in its turn vanishing like a dry\r\ndust-cloud into the limbo of the art universe:\r\n\r\n\r\n                The well-depicted flower,\r\n    Wrought patiently into the snowy lawn\r\n    Unfolds its bosom; buds, and leaves, and sprigs,\r\n    And curling tendrils, gracefully disposed,\r\n    Follow the nimble finger of the fair;\r\n    A wreath, that cannot fade, of flowers that blow\r\n    With most success when all besides decay.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \u201CThe Winter Evening.\u201D]\r\n\r\nThere was not much of a garden about the place, but there was a\r\nlittle lawn amongst the pines, in the midst of which stood a huge old\r\npatriarch, with red stem and grotesquely contorted branches: beneath\r\nit was a bench, and there, after their return from their two hours\u2019\r\nride, the ladies sat, while the sun was at its warmest, on the mornings\r\nof their first and second readings: Malcolm sat on a wheelbarrow.\r\nAfter lunch on the second day, which they had agreed from the first,\r\nas ladies so often do, when free of the more devouring sex, should be\r\ntheir dinner, and after due visits paid to a multitude of animals, the\r\ndesire awoke simultaneously in them for another portion of \u201CSt Ronan\u2019s\r\nWell.\u201D They resolved therefore to send for their reader as soon as they\r\nhad had tea. But when they sent he was nowhere to be found, and they\r\nconcluded on a stroll.\r\n\r\nAnticipating no further requirement of his service that day, Malcolm\r\nhad gone out. Drawn by the sea, he took his way through the dim solemn\r\nboughless wood, as if to keep a moonlight tryst with his early love.\r\nBut the sun was not yet down, and among the dark trees, shot through\r\nby the level radiance, he wandered, his heart swelling in his bosom\r\nwith the glory and the mystery. Again the sun was _in_ the wood, its\r\nburning centre, the marvel of the home which he left in the morning\r\nonly to return thither at night, and it was now a temple of red light,\r\nmore gorgeous, more dream-woven than the morning. How he glowed on the\r\nred stems of the bare pines, fit pillars for that which seemed temple\r\nand rite, organ and anthem in one--the worship of the earth, uplifted\r\nto its Hyperion! It was a world of faery; anything might happen in it.\r\nWho, in that region of marvel, would start to see suddenly a knight\r\non a great sober war-horse come slowly pacing down the torrent of\r\ncarmine splendour, flashing it, like the Knight of the Sun himself, in\r\na flood from every hollow, a gleam from every flat, and a star from\r\nevery round and knob of his armour? As the trees thinned away, and his\r\nfeet sank deeper in the looser sand, and the sea broke blue out of the\r\ninfinite, talking quietly to itself of its own solemn swell into being\r\nout of the infinite thought unseen, Malcolm felt as if the world with\r\nits loveliness and splendour were sinking behind him, and the cool\r\nentrancing sweetness of the eternal dreamland of the soul, where the\r\ndreams are more real than any sights of the world, were opening wide\r\nbefore his entering feet.\r\n\r\n\u201CShall not death be like this?\u201D he said, and threw himself upon the\r\nsand, and hid his face and his eyes from it all. For there is this\r\nstrange thing about all glory embodied in the material, that, when the\r\npassion of it rises to its height, we hurry from its presence that its\r\nidea may perfect itself in silent and dark and deaf delight. Of its\r\nmaterial self we want no more: its real self we have, and it sits at\r\nthe fountain of our tears. Malcolm hid his face from the source of his\r\ngladness, and worshipped the source of that source.\r\n\r\nRare as they are at any given time, there have been, I think, such\r\nyouths in all ages of the world--youths capable of glorying in the\r\nfountain whence issues the torrent of their youthful might. Nor is\r\nthe reality of their early worship blasted for us by any mistral of\r\ndoubt that may blow upon their spirit from the icy region of the\r\nunderstanding. The cold fevers, the vital agues that such winds breed,\r\ncan but prove that not yet has the sun of the perfect arisen upon them;\r\nthat the Eternal has not yet manifested himself in all regions of\r\ntheir being; that a grander, more obedient, therefore more blissful,\r\nmore absorbing worship yet, is possible, nay, is essential to them.\r\nThese chills are but the shivers of the divine nature, unsatisfied,\r\nhalf-starved, banished from its home, divided from its origin, after\r\nwhich it calls in groanings it knows not how to shape into sounds\r\narticulate. They are the spirit-wail of the holy infant after the bosom\r\nof its mother. Let no man long back to the bliss of his youth--but\r\nforward to a bliss that shall swallow even that, and contain it, and be\r\nmore than it. Our history moves in cycles, it is true, ever returning\r\ntoward the point whence it started; but it is in the imperfect circles\r\nof a spiral it moves; it returns--but ever to a point above the former:\r\neven the second childhood, at which the fool jeers, is the better, the\r\ntruer, the fuller childhood, growing strong to cast off altogether,\r\nwith the husk of its own enveloping age, that of its family, its\r\ncountry, its world as well. Age is not all decay: it is the ripening,\r\nthe swelling of the fresh life within, that withers and bursts the husk.\r\n\r\nWhen Malcolm lifted his head, the sun had gone down. He rose and\r\nwandered along the sand towards the moon--at length blooming out of\r\nthe darkening sky, where she had hung all day like a washed-out rag of\r\nlight, to revive as the sunlight faded. He watched the banished life of\r\nher day-swoon returning, until, gathering courage, she that had been\r\nno one, shone out fair and clear, in conscious queendom of the night.\r\nThen, in the friendly infolding of her dreamlight and the dreamland it\r\ncreated, Malcolm\u2019s soul revived as in the comfort of the lesser, the\r\nmitigated glory, and, as the moon into radiance from the darkened air,\r\nand the nightingale into music from the sleep-stilled world of birds,\r\nblossomed from the speechlessness of thought and feeling into a strange\r\nkind of brooding song. If the words were half nonsense, the feeling was\r\nnot the less real. Such as they were, they came almost of themselves,\r\nand the tune came with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rose o\u2019 my hert,\r\n    Open yer leaves to the lampin\u2019 mune;\r\n  Into the curls lat her keek an\u2019 dert;\r\n    She\u2019ll tak the colour but gi\u2019e ye tune.\r\n\r\n  Buik o\u2019 my brain,\r\n    Open yer neuks to the starry signs;\r\n  Lat the een o\u2019 the holy luik an\u2019 strain\r\n    An\u2019 glimmer an\u2019 score atween the lines.\r\n\r\n  Cup o\u2019 my sowl,\r\n    Gowd an\u2019 diamond an\u2019 ruby cup,\r\n  Ye\u2019re noucht ava but a toom dry bowl,\r\n    Till the wine o\u2019 the kingdom fill ye up,\r\n\r\n  Conscience-glass,\r\n    Mirror the infinite all in thee;\r\n  Melt the bounded and make it pass\r\n    Into the tideless, shoreless sea.\r\n\r\n  World of my life,\r\n    Swing thee round thy sunny track;\r\n  Fire and wind and water and strife--\r\n    Carry them all to the glory back.\r\n\r\nEver as he halted for a word, the moonlight, and the low sweet waves\r\non the sands, filled up the pauses to his ear; and there he lay,\r\nlooking up to the sky and the moon and the rose-diamond stars, his\r\nthoughts half-dissolved in feeling, and his feeling half-crystallised\r\nto thought.\r\n\r\nOut of the dim wood came two lovely forms into the moonlight, and\r\nsoftly approached him--so softly that he knew nothing of their\r\nnearness until Florimel spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that MacPhail?\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, my lady,\u201D answered Malcolm, and bounded to his feet\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat were you singing?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou could hardly call it singing, my lady. We should call it\r\ncrooning in Scotland.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCroon it again then.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI couldn\u2019t, my lady. It\u2019s gone.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t mean to pretend that you were extemporising?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI was crooning what came--like the birds, my lady. I couldn\u2019t\r\nhave done it if I had thought anyone was near.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen, half ashamed, and anxious to turn the talk from the threshold\r\nof his secret chamber, he said, \u201CDid you ever see a lovelier night,\r\nladies?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot often, certainly,\u201D answered Clementina.\r\n\r\nShe was not quite pleased and not altogether offended at his\r\naddressing them dually. A curious sense of impropriety in the state\r\nof things bewildered her--she and her friend talking thus, in\r\nthe moonlight, on the sea-shore, doing nothing, with her friend\u2019s\r\ngroom--and such a groom, his mistress asking him to sing again,\r\nand he addressing them both with a remark on the beauty of the\r\nnight! She had braved the world a good deal, but she did not choose\r\nto brave it where nothing was to be had, and she was too honest to\r\nsay to herself that the world would never know--that there was\r\nnothing to brave: she was not one to do that in secret to which she\r\nwould not hold her face. Yet all the time she had a doubt whether\r\nthis young man, whom it would certainly be improper to encourage\r\nby addressing from any level but one of lofty superiority, did\r\nnot belong to a higher sphere than theirs; while certainly no man\r\ncould be more unpresuming, or less forward even when opposing his\r\nopinion to theirs. Still--if an angel were to come down and take\r\ncharge of their horses, would ladies be justified in treating him\r\nas other than a servant?\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is just the sort of night,\u201D Malcolm resumed, \u201Cwhen I could\r\nalmost persuade myself I was not quite sure I wasn\u2019t dreaming. It\r\nmakes a kind of border land betwixt waking and sleeping, knowing\r\nand dreaming, in our brain. In a night like this I fancy we feel\r\nsomething like the colour of what God feels when he is making the\r\nlovely chaos of a new world, a new kind of world, such as has never\r\nbeen before.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI think we had better go in,\u201D said Clementina to Florimel, and\r\nturned away.\r\n\r\nFlorimel made no objection, and they walked towards the wood.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou really must get rid of him as soon as you can,\u201D said Clementina,\r\nwhen again the moonless night of the pines had received them: \u201Che\r\nis certainly more than half a lunatic. It is almost full moon now,\u201D\r\nshe added, looking up. \u201CI have never seen him so bad.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel\u2019s clear laugh rang through the wood.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t be alarmed, Clementina,\u201D she said. \u201CHe has talked like that\r\never since I knew him; and if he is mad, at least he is no worse\r\nthan he has always been. It is nothing but poetry--yeast on the\r\nbrain, my father used to say. We should have a fish-poet of him--\r\na new thing in the world, he said. He would never be cured till he\r\nbroke out in a book of poetry. I should be afraid my father would\r\nbreak the catechism and not rest in his grave till the resurrection,\r\nif I were to send Malcolm away.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor Malcolm, he was at first not a little mazed at the utter blankness\r\nof the wall against which his words had dashed themselves. Then he\r\nsmiled queerly to himself, and said:\r\n\r\n\u201CI used to think ilka bonny lassie bude to be a poetess--for hoo\r\nsud she be bonnie but by the informin\u2019 hermony o\u2019 her bein\u2019?--an\u2019\r\nwhat\u2019s that but the poetry o\u2019 _the_ Poet, the Makar, as they ca\u2019d a\r\npoet i\u2019 the auld Scots tongue?--but haith! I ken better an\u2019 waur\r\nnoo! There\u2019s gane the twa bonniest _I_ ever saw, an\u2019 I s\u2019 lay my heid\r\nthere\u2019s mair poetry in auld man-faced Miss Horn nor in a dizzin\r\nlike them. Ech! but it\u2019s some sair to bide. It\u2019s sair upon a man to\r\nsee a bonny wuman \u2019at has nae poetry, nae inward lichtsome hermony\r\nin her. But it\u2019s dooms sairer yet to come upo\u2019 ane wantin\u2019 cowmon\r\nsense! Saw onybody ever sic a gran\u2019 sicht as my Leddy Clementina!\r\n--an\u2019 wha can say but she\u2019s weel named frae the hert oot?--as\r\nguid at the hert, I\u2019ll sweir, as at the een! but eh me! to hear\r\nthe blether o\u2019 nonsense \u2019at comes oot atween thae twa bonny yetts\r\no\u2019 music--an\u2019 a\u2019 cause she winna gi\u2019e her hert rist an\u2019 time\r\neneuch to grow bigger, but maun aye be settin\u2019 a\u2019 things richt afore\r\ntheir time, an\u2019 her ain fitness for the job! It\u2019s sic a faithless\r\nkin\u2019 o\u2019 a w\u2019y that! I could jist fancy I saw her gaein\u2019 a\u2019 roon\u2019\r\nthe trees o\u2019 a simmer nicht, pittin\u2019 hiney upo\u2019 the peers an\u2019 the\r\npeaches, \u2019cause she cudna lippen to natur\u2019 to ripe them sweet eneuch\r\n--only \u2019at she wad never tak the hiney frae the bees. She\u2019s jist\r\nthe pictur o\u2019 Natur\u2019 hersel\u2019 turnt some dementit. I cud jist fancy\r\nI saw her gaein\u2019 aboot amo\u2019 the ripe corn, on sic a nicht as this\r\no\u2019 the mune, happin\u2019 \u2019t frae the frost. An\u2019 I s\u2019 warran\u2019 no ae\r\nmesh in oor nets wad she lea\u2019 ohn clippit open gien the twine had\r\na herrin\u2019 by the gills. She\u2019s e\u2019en sae pitifu\u2019 owre the sinner \u2019at\r\nshe winna gi\u2019e him a chance o\u2019 growin\u2019 better. I won\u2019er gien she\r\nbelieves \u2019at there\u2019s ae great thoucht abune a\u2019, an\u2019 aneth a\u2019, an\u2019\r\nroon\u2019 a\u2019, an\u2019 in a\u2019thing. She cudna be in sic a mist o\u2019 benevolence\r\nand parritch-hertitness gien she cud lippen till a wiser. It\u2019s nae\r\nwon\u2019er she kens naething aboot poetry but the meeserable sids an\u2019\r\nsawdist an\u2019 leavin\u2019s the gran\u2019 leddies sing an\u2019 ca\u2019 sangs! Nae mair\r\nis \u2019t ony won\u2019er she sud tak me for dementit, gien she h\u2019ard what\r\nI was singin\u2019! only I canna think she did that, for I was but croonin\u2019\r\ntill mysel\u2019.\u201D--Malcolm was wrong there, for he was singing out\r\nloud and clear.--\u201CThat was but a kin\u2019 o\u2019 an unknown tongue atween\r\nHim an\u2019 me an\u2019 no anither.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nTHE SWIFT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorimel succeeded so far in reassuring her friend as to the safety\r\nif not sanity of her groom, that she made no objection to yet another\r\nreading from \u201CSt Ronan\u2019s Well\u201D--upon which occasion an incident\r\noccurred that did far more to reassure her than all the attestations of\r\nhis mistress.\r\n\r\nClementina, in consenting, had proposed, it being a warm sunny\r\nafternoon, that they should that time go down to the lake, and sit\r\nwith their work on the bank, while Malcolm read. This lake, like the\r\nwhole place, and some of the people in it, was rather strange --not\r\nresembling any piece of water that Malcolm at least had ever seen. More\r\nthan a mile in length, but quite narrow, it lay on the sea-shore--a\r\nlake of deep fresh water, with nothing between it and the sea but a\r\nbank of sand, up which the great waves came rolling in south-westerly\r\nwinds, one now and then toppling over--to the disconcerting no doubt of\r\nthe pikey multitude within.\r\n\r\nThe head only of the mere came into Clementina\u2019s property, and they sat\r\non the landward side of it, on a sandy bank, among the half-exposed\r\nroots of a few ancient firs, where a little stream that fed the lake\r\nhad made a small gully, and was now trotting over a bed of pebbles\r\nin the bottom of it. Clementina was describing to Florimel the\r\npeculiarities of the place, how there was no outlet to the lake, how\r\nthe water went filtering through the sand into the sea, how in some\r\nparts it was very deep, and what large pike there were in it. Malcolm\r\nsat a little aside as usual, with his face towards the ladies, and the\r\nbook open in his hand, waiting a sign to begin, but looking at the\r\nlake, which here was some fifty yards broad, reedy at the edge, dark\r\nand deep in the centre. All at once he sprang to his feet, dropping the\r\nbook, ran down to the brink of the water, undoing his buckled belt and\r\npulling off his coat as he ran, threw himself over the bordering reeds\r\ninto the pool, and disappeared with a great plash.\r\n\r\nClementina gave a scream, and started up with distraction in her face:\r\nshe made no doubt that in the sudden ripeness of his insanity he had\r\ncommitted suicide. But Florimel, though startled by her friend\u2019s cry,\r\nlaughed, and crowded out assurances that Malcolm knew well enough what\r\nhe was about. It was longer, however, than she found pleasant, before\r\na black head appeared--yards away, for he had risen at a great slope,\r\nswimming towards the other side. What _could_ he be after? Near the\r\nmiddle he swam more softly, and almost stopped. Then first they spied a\r\nsmall dark object on the surface. Almost the same moment it rose into\r\nthe air. They thought Malcolm had flung it up. Instantly they perceived\r\nthat it was a bird--a swift. Somehow it had dropped into the water, but\r\na lift from Malcolm\u2019s hand had restored it to the air of its bliss.\r\n\r\nBut instead of turning and swimming back, Malcolm held on, and getting\r\nout on the farther side, ran down the beach and rushed into the sea,\r\nrousing once more the apprehensions of Clementina. The shore sloped\r\nrapidly, and in a moment he was in deep water. He swam a few yards out,\r\nswam ashore again, ran round the end of the lake, found his coat, and\r\ngot from it his pocket-handkerchief. Having therewith dried his hands\r\nand face, he wrang out the sleeves of his shirt a little, put on his\r\ncoat, returned to his place, and said, as he took up the book and sat\r\ndown,\r\n\r\n\u201CI beg your pardon, my ladies; but just as I heard my Lady Clementina\r\nsay _pikes_, I saw the little swift in the water. There was no time to\r\nlose. Swiftie had but a poor chance.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he proceeded to find the place in the book.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t imagine we are going to have you read in such a plight as\r\nthat!\u201D cried Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will take good care, my lady. I have books of my own, and I handle\r\nthem like babies.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou foolish man! It is of you in your wet clothes, not of the book I\r\nam thinking,\u201D said Clementina indignantly.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m much obliged to you, my lady, but there\u2019s no fear of me. You saw\r\nme wash the fresh water out. Salt water never hurts.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must go and change nevertheless,\u201D said Clementina.\r\n\r\nMalcolm looked to his mistress. She gave him a sign to obey, and he\r\nrose. He had taken three steps towards the house when Clementina\r\nrecalled him.\r\n\r\n\u201COne word, if you please,\u201D she said. \u201CHow is it that a man who risks\r\nhis life for that of a little bird, can be so heartless to a great\r\nnoble creature like that horse of yours? I cannot understand it!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady,\u201D returned Malcolm with a smile, \u201CI was no more risking my\r\nlife than you would be in taking a fly out of the milk-jug. And for\r\nyour question, if your ladyship will only think, you cannot fail to\r\nsee the difference. Indeed I explained my treatment of Kelpie to your\r\nladyship that first morning in the park, when you so kindly rebuked me\r\nfor it, but I don\u2019t think your ladyship listened to a word I said.\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina\u2019s face flushed, and she turned to her friend with a \u201CWell!\u201D\r\nin her eyes. But Florimel kept her head bent over her embroidery; and\r\nMalcolm, no further notice being taken of him walked away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nST RONAN\u2019S WELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day the reading was resumed, and for several days was\r\nregularly continued. Each day, as their interest grew, longer time was\r\ndevoted to it. They were all simple enough to accept what the author\r\ngave them, nor, had a critic of the time been present to instruct them\r\nthat in this last he had fallen off, would they have heeded him much:\r\nfor Malcolm, it was the first story by the Great Unknown he had seen. A\r\nquestion however occurring, not of art but of morals, he was at once on\r\nthe alert. It arose when they reached that portion of the tale in which\r\nthe true heir to an earldom and its wealth offers to leave all in the\r\npossession of the usurper, on the one condition of his ceasing to annoy\r\na certain lady, whom, by villainy of the worst, he had gained the power\r\nof rendering unspeakably miserable. Naturally enough, at this point\r\nMalcolm\u2019s personal interest was suddenly excited: here were elements\r\nstrangely correspondent with the circumstances of his present position.\r\nTyrrel\u2019s offer of acquiescence in things as they were, and abandonment\r\nof his rights, which, in the story, is so amazing to the man of the\r\nworld to whom it is first propounded, drew an exclamation of delight\r\nfrom both ladies--from Clementina because of its unselfishness, from\r\nFlorimel because of its devotion: neither of them was at any time ready\r\nto raise a moral question, and least of all where the heart approved.\r\nBut Malcolm was interested after a different fashion from theirs. Often\r\nduring the reading he had made remarks and given explanations--not so\r\nmuch to the annoyance of Lady Clementina as she had feared, for since\r\nhis rescue of the swift, she had been more favourably disposed towards\r\nhim, and had judged him a little more justly--not that she understood\r\nhim, but that the gulf between them had contracted. He paused a moment,\r\nthen said:\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you think it was right, my ladies? Ought Mr Tyrrel to have made\r\nsuch an offer?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was most generous of him,\u201D said Clementina, not without indignation\r\n--and with the tone of one whose answer should decide the question.\r\n\r\n\u201CSplendidly generous,\u201D replied Malcolm; \u201C--but--I so well remember when\r\nMr Graham first made me see that the question of duty does not always\r\nlie between a good thing and a bad thing: there would be no room for\r\ncasuistry then, he said. A man has very often to decide between one\r\ngood thing and another. But indeed I can hardly tell without more time\r\nto think, whether that comes in here. If a man wants to be generous, it\r\nmust at least be at his own expense.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut surely,\u201D said Florimel, not in the least aware that she was\r\nchanging sides, \u201Ca man ought to hold by the rights that birth and\r\ninheritance give him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is by no means so clear, my lady,\u201D returned Malcolm, \u201Cas you\r\nseem to think. A man _may_ be bound to hold by things that are his\r\nrights, but certainly not because they are rights. One of the grandest\r\nthings in having rights is that, being your rights, you may give them\r\nup--except, of course, they involve duties with the performance of\r\nwhich the abnegation would interfere.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have been trying to think,\u201D said Lady Clementina, \u201Cwhat can be the\r\ntwo good things here to choose between.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is the right question, and logically put, my lady,\u201D rejoined\r\nMalcolm, who, from his early training, could not help sometimes putting\r\non the schoolmaster. \u201CThe two good things are--let me see--yes--on\r\nthe one hand the protection of the lady to whom he owed all possible\r\ndevotion of man to woman, and on the other what he owed to his tenants,\r\nand perhaps to society in general--yes --as the owner of wealth and\r\nposition. There is generosity on the one side and dry duty on the\r\nother.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut this was no case of mere love to the lady, I think,\u201D said\r\nClementina. \u201CDid Mr Tyrrel not owe Miss Mowbray what reparation lay in\r\nhis power? Was it not his tempting of her to a secret marriage, while\r\nyet she was nothing more than a girl, that brought the mischief upon\r\nher?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is the point,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cthat makes the one difficulty.\r\nStill, I do not see how there can be much of a question. He could have\r\nno right to do fresh wrong for the mitigation of the consequences of\r\npreceding wrong--to sacrifice others to atone for injuries done by\r\nhimself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere would be the wrong to others?\u201D said Florimel, now back to her\r\nformer position. \u201CWhy could it matter to tenants or society which of\r\nthe brothers happened to be an earl?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COnly this, that, in the one case, the landlord of his tenants, the\r\nearl in society, would be an honourable man, in the other, a villain--a\r\ndifference which might have consequences.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut,\u201D said Lady Clementina, \u201Cis not generosity something more than\r\nduty--something higher, something beyond it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D answered Malcolm, \u201Cso long as it does not go against duty, but\r\nkeeps in the same direction, is in harmony with it. I doubt much,\r\nthough, whether, as we grow in what is good, we shall not come soon to\r\nsee that generosity is but our duty, and nothing very grand and beyond\r\nit. But the man who chooses to be generous at the expense of justice,\r\neven if he give up at the same time everything of his own, is but a\r\npoor creature beside him who, for the sake of the right, will not only\r\nconsent to appear selfish in the eyes of men, but will go against his\r\nown heart and the comfort of those dearest to him. The man who accepts\r\na crown _may be_ more noble than he who lays one down and retires to\r\nthe desert. Of the worthies who do things by faith, some are sawn\r\nasunder, and some subdue kingdoms. The look of the thing is nothing.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel made a neat little yawn over her work. Clementina\u2019s hands\r\nrested a moment in her lap, and she looked thoughtful. But she resumed\r\nher work, and said no more. Malcolm began to read again. Presently\r\nClementina interrupted him. She had not been listening.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy should a man want to be better than his neighbours, any more than\r\nto be richer?\u201D she said, as if uttering her thoughts aloud.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, indeed,\u201D responded Malcolm, \u201Cexcept he wants to become a\r\nhypocrite?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen, why do you talk for duty against generosity?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh!\u201D said Malcolm, for a moment perplexed. He did not at once catch\r\nthe relation of her ideas. \u201CDoes a man ever do his duty,\u201D he rejoined\r\nat length, \u201Cin order to be better than his neighbours.\u201D If he does, he\r\nwon\u2019t do it long. A man does his duty because he must. He has no choice\r\nbut do it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf a man has no choice, how is it that so many men choose to do\r\nwrong?\u201D asked Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CIn virtue of being slaves and stealing the choice,\u201D replied Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are playing with words,\u201D said Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I am, at least I am not playing with things,\u201D returned Malcolm. \u201CIf\r\nyou like it better, my lady, I will say that, in declaring he has no\r\nchoice, the man with all his soul chooses the good, recognizing it as\r\nthe very necessity of his nature.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I know in myself that I have a choice, all you say goes for\r\nnothing,\u201D persisted Clementina. \u201CI am not at all sure I would not do\r\nwrong for the sake of another. The more one preferred what was right,\r\nthe greater would be the sacrifice.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf it was for the grandeur of it, my lady, that would be for the man\u2019s\r\nown sake, not his friend\u2019s.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLeave that out then,\u201D said Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe more a man loved another--say a woman, as here in the story--then\r\nit seems to me, the more willing would he be that she should continue\r\nto suffer rather than cease by wrong. Think, my lady: the essence of\r\nwrong is injustice: to help another by wrong is to do injustice to\r\nsomebody you do not know well enough to love for the sake of one you do\r\nknow well enough to love. What honest man could think of that twice?\r\nThe woman capable of accepting such a sacrifice would be contemptible.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe need not know of it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe would know that she needed but to know of it to despise him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen might it not be noble in him to consent for her sake to be\r\ncontemptible in her eyes?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf no others were concerned. And then there would be no injustice,\r\ntherefore nothing wrong, and nothing contemptible.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMight not what he did be wrong in the abstract, without having\r\nreference to any person?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is no wrong man can do but is a thwarting of the living Right.\r\nSurely you believe, my lady, that there is a living Power of right,\r\nwhose justice is the soul of our justice, who _will_ have right done,\r\nand causes even our own souls to take up arms against us when we do\r\nwrong.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIn plain language, I suppose you mean--Do I believe in a God?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is what I mean, if by a God you mean a being who cares about us,\r\nand loves justice--that is, fair play--one whom therefore we wrong to\r\nthe very heart when we do a thing that is not just.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI would gladly believe in such a being, if things were so that I\r\ncould. As they are, I confess it seems to me the best thing to doubt\r\nit. I do doubt it very much. How can I help doubting it, when I see so\r\nmuch suffering, oppression, and cruelty in the world? If there were\r\nsuch a being as you say, would he permit the horrible things we hear of\r\non every hand?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI used to find that a difficulty. Indeed it troubled me sorely until\r\nI came to understand things better. I remember Mr Graham saying once\r\nsomething like this--I did not understand it for months after: \u2018Every\r\nkind-hearted person who thinks a great deal of being comfortable, and\r\ntakes prosperity to consist in being well-off, must be tempted to doubt\r\nthe existence of a God.--And perhaps it is well they should be so\r\ntempted,\u2019 he added.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy did he add that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI think because such are in danger of believing in an evil God. And\r\nif men believed in an evil God, and had not the courage to defy him,\r\nthey must sink to the very depths of savagery. At least that is what I\r\nventured to suppose he meant.\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina opened her eyes wide, but said nothing. Religious people,\r\nshe found, could think as boldly as she.\r\n\r\n\u201CI remember all about it so well!\u201D Malcolm added, thoughtfully. \u201CWe had\r\nbeen talking about the Prometheus of \u00C6schylus--how he would not give in\r\nto Jupiter.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am trying to understand,\u201D said Clementina, and ceased--and a silence\r\nfell which for a few moments Malcolm could not break. For suddenly he\r\nfelt as if he had fallen under the power of a spell. Something seemed\r\nto radiate from her silence which invaded his consciousness. It was as\r\nif the wind which dwells in the tree of life had waked in the twilight\r\nof heaven, and blew upon his spirit. It was not that now first he saw\r\nthat she was beautiful; the moment his eyes fell upon her that morning\r\nin the park, he saw her beautiful as he had never seen woman before.\r\nNeither was it that now first he saw her good; even in that first\r\ninterview her heart had revealed itself to him as very lovely. But\r\nthe foolishness which flowed from her lips, noble and unselfish as it\r\nwas, had barred the way betwixt his feelings and her individuality as\r\neffectually as if she had been the loveliest of Venuses lying uncarved\r\nin the lunar marble of Carrara. There _are_ men to whom silliness is\r\nan absolute freezing mixture; to whose hearts a plain, sensible woman\r\nat once appeals as a woman, while no amount of beauty can serve as\r\nsweet oblivious antidote to counteract the nausea produced by folly.\r\nMalcolm had found Clementina irritating, and the more irritating\r\nthat she was so beautiful. But at the first sound from her lips that\r\nindicated genuine and truthful thought, the atmosphere had begun to\r\nchange; and at the first troubled gleam in her eyes, revealing that she\r\npursued some dim-seen thing of the world of reality, a nameless potency\r\nthrobbed into the spiritual space betwixt her and him, and embraced\r\nthem in an aether of entrancing relation. All that had been needed to\r\nawake love to her was, that her soul, her self, should look out of its\r\nwindows--and now he had caught a glimpse of it. Not all her beauty,\r\nnot all her heart, not all her courage, could draw him while she would\r\nride only a hobby-horse, however tight its skin might be stuffed with\r\nemotions. But now who could tell how soon she might be charging in the\r\nfront line of the Amazons of the Lord--on as real a horse as any in the\r\nheavenly army? For was she not thinking--the rarest human operation in\r\nthe world?\r\n\r\n\u201CI will try to speak a little more clearly, my lady,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CIf\r\nease and comfort, and the pleasures of animal and intellectual being,\r\nwere the best things to be had, as they are the only things most people\r\ndesire, then that maker who did not care that his creatures should\r\npossess or were deprived of such, could not be a good God. But if the\r\nneed with the lack of such things should be the means, the only means,\r\nof their gaining something in its very nature so much better that----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut,\u201D interrupted Clementina, \u201Cif they don\u2019t care about anything\r\nbetter--if they are content as they are?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShould he then who called them into existence be limited in his\r\nfurther intents for the perfecting of their creation, by their notions\r\nconcerning themselves who cannot add to their life one cubit?--such\r\nnotions being often consciously dishonest? If he knows them worthless\r\nwithout something that he can give, shall he withhold his hand because\r\nthey do not care that he should stretch it forth? Should a child not be\r\ntaught to ride because he is content to run on foot?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut the means, according to your own theory, are so frightful!\u201D said\r\nClementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut suppose he knows that the barest beginnings of the good he intends\r\nthem would not merely reconcile them to those means, but cause them\r\nto choose his will at any expense of suffering! I tell you, Lady\r\nClementina,\u201D continued Malcolm, rising, and approaching her a step or\r\ntwo, \u201Cif I had not the hope of one day being good like God himself,\r\nif I thought there was no escape out of the wrong and badness I feel\r\nwithin me and know I am not able to rid myself of without supreme help,\r\nnot all the wealth and honours of the world could reconcile me to life.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou do not know what you are talking of,\u201D said Clementina, coldly and\r\nsoftly, without lifting her head.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou mean you would kill yourself but for your belief in God?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBy life, I meant _being_, my lady. If there were no God, I dared\r\nnot kill myself, lest worse should be waiting me in the awful voids\r\nbeyond. If there be a God, living or dying is all one--so it be what he\r\npleases.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have read of saints,\u201D said Clementina, with cool dissatisfaction in\r\nher tone, \u201Cuttering such sentiments,\u201D----\u201C_Sentiments!_\u201D said Malcolm\r\nto himself----\u201C--and I do not doubt such were felt or at least imagined\r\nby them; but I fail to understand how, even supposing these things\r\ntrue, a young man like yourself should, in the midst of a busy world,\r\nand with an occupation which, to say the least,----\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nHere she paused. After a moment Malcolm ventured to help her.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs so far from an ideal one--would you say, my lady?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSomething like that,\u201D answered Clementina, and concluded,--\u201CI wonder\r\nhow _you_ can have arrived at such ideas.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is nothing wonderful in it, my lady,\u201D returned Malcolm. \u201CWhy\r\nshould not a youth, a boy, a child--for as a child I thought about what\r\nthe kingdom of heaven could mean--desire with all his might that his\r\nheart and mind should be clean, his will strong, his thoughts just, his\r\nhead clear, his soul dwelling in the place of life? Why should I not\r\ndesire that my life should be a complete thing, and an outgoing of life\r\nto my neighbour? Some people are content not to do mean actions: I want\r\nto become incapable of a mean thought or feeling; and so I shall be\r\nbefore all is done.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CStill, how did you come to begin so much earlier than others?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAll I know as to that, my lady, is that I had the best man in the\r\nworld to teach me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd why did not I have such a man to teach me? I could have learned of\r\nsuch a man too.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you are able now, my lady, it does not follow that it would have\r\nbeen the best thing for you sooner. Some children learn far better for\r\nnot being begun early, and will get before others who have been at it\r\nfor years. As you grow ready for it, somewhere or other you will find\r\nwhat is needful for you--in a book, or a friend, or, best of all in\r\nyour own thoughts--the eternal thought speaking in your thought.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt flashed through her mind, \u201CCan it be that I have found it now --on\r\nthe lips of a groom?\u201D\r\n\r\nWas it her own spirit or another that laughed strangely within her?\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, as you seem to know so much better than other people,\u201D she said,\r\n\u201CI want you to explain to me how the God in whom you profess to believe\r\ncan make use of such cruelties. It seems to me more like the revelling\r\nof a demon.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady!\u201D remonstrated Malcolm, \u201CI never pretended to explain. All\r\nI say is, that, if I had reason for hoping there was a God, and if\r\nI found, from my own experience and the testimony of others, that\r\nsuffering led to valued good, I should think, hope, expect to find that\r\nhe caused suffering for reasons of the highest, purest and kindest\r\nimport, such as when understood must be absolutely satisfactory to the\r\nsufferers themselves. If a man cannot believe that, and if he thinks\r\nthe pain the worst evil of all, then of course he cannot believe there\r\nis a good God. Still, even then, if he would lay claim to being a lover\r\nof truth, he ought to give the idea--the mere _idea_ of God fair play,\r\nlest there should be a good God after all, and he all his life doing\r\nhim the injustice of refusing him his trust and obedience.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd how are we to give the mere idea of him fair play?\u201D asked\r\nClementina, rather contemptuously. But I think she was fighting\r\nemotion, confused and troublesome.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy looking to the heart of whatever claims to be a revelation of him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt would take a lifetime to read the half of such.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will correct myself, and say--whatever of the sort has best claims\r\non _your_ regard--whatever any person you look upon as good, believes\r\nand would have you believe--at the same time doing diligently what you\r\n_know_ to be right; for, if there be a God, that must be his will, and,\r\nif there be not, it remains our duty.\u201D\r\n\r\nAll this time, Florimel was working away at her embroidery, a little\r\nsmile of satisfaction flickering on her face. She was pleased to hear\r\nher clever friend talking so with her strange vassal. As to what they\r\nwere saying, she had no doubt it was all right, but to her it was not\r\ninteresting. She was mildly debating with herself whether she should\r\ntell her friend about Lenorme.\r\n\r\nClementina\u2019s work now lay on her lap and her hands on her work, while\r\nher eyes at one time gazed on the grass at her feet, at another\r\nsearched Malcolm\u2019s face with a troubled look. The light of Malcolm\u2019s\r\ncandle was beginning to penetrate into her dusky room, the power of\r\nhis faith to tell upon the weakness of her unbelief. There is no\r\nstrength in unbelief. Even the unbelief of what is false is no source\r\nof might. It is the truth shining from behind that gives the strength\r\nto disbelieve. But into the house where the refusal of the bad is\r\nfollowed by no embracing of the good-- the house empty and swept and\r\ngarnished--the bad will return, bringing with it seven evils that are\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nIf something of that sacred mystery, holy in the heart of the Father,\r\nwhich draws together the souls of man and woman, was at work between\r\nthem, let those scoff at the mingling of love and religion who know\r\nnothing of either; but man or woman who, loving woman or man, has\r\nnever in that love lifted the heart to the Father, and everyone\r\nwhose divine love has not yet cast at least an arm round the human\r\nlove, must take heed what they think of themselves, for they are yet\r\nbut paddlers in the tide of the eternal ocean. Love is a lifting no\r\nless than a swelling of the heart. What changes, what metamorphoses,\r\ntransformations, purifications, glorifications, this or that love must\r\nundergo ere it take its eternal place in the kingdom of heaven, through\r\nall its changes yet remaining, in its one essential root, the same, let\r\nthe coming redemption reveal. The hope of all honest lovers will lead\r\nthem to the vision. Only let them remember that love must dwell in the\r\nwill as well as in the heart.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the nature of Malcolm\u2019s influence upon Lady Clementina,\r\nshe resented it, thinking towards and speaking to him repellently.\r\nSomething in her did not like him. She knew he did not approve of her,\r\nand she did not like being disapproved of. Neither did she approve of\r\nhim. He was pedantic--and far too good for an honest and brave youth:\r\nnot that she could say she had seen dishonesty or cowardice in him,\r\nor that she could have told which vice she would prefer to season his\r\ngoodness withal, and bring him to the level of her ideal. And then,\r\nfor all her theories of equality, he was a groom--therefore to a lady\r\nought to be repulsive--at least when she found him intruding into the\r\nchambers of her thoughts --personally intruding--yes, and met there\r\nby some traitorous feelings whose behaviour she could not understand.\r\nShe resented it all, and felt towards Malcolm as if he were guilty of\r\nforcing himself into the sacred presence of her bosom\u2019s queen--whereas\r\nit was his angel that did so, his Idea, over which he had no control.\r\nClementina would have turned that Idea out, and when she found she\r\ncould not, her soul started up wrathful, in maidenly disgust with her\r\nheart, and cast resentment upon everything in him whereon it would\r\nhang. She had not yet, however, come to ask herself any questions; she\r\nhad only begun to fear that a woman to whom a person from the stables\r\ncould be interesting, even in the form of an unexplained riddle,\r\nmust be herself a person of low tastes; and that, for all her pride\r\nin coming of honest people, there must be a drop of bad blood in her\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\nFor a time her eyes had been fixed on her work, and there had been\r\nsilence in the little group.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady!\u201D said Malcolm, and drew a step nearer to Clementina.\r\n\r\nShe looked up. How lovely she was with the trouble in her eyes! Thought\r\nMalcolm, \u201CIf only she were what she might be! If the form were but\r\nfilled with the spirit! the body with life!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady!\u201D he repeated, just a little embarrassed, \u201CI should like\r\nto tell you one thing that came to me only lately--came to me when\r\nthinking over the hard words you spoke to me that day in the park. But\r\nit is something so awful that I dare not speak of it except you will\r\nmake your heart solemn to hear it.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe stopped, with his eyes questioning hers. Clementina\u2019s first thought\r\nonce more was madness, but as she steadily returned his look, her face\r\ngrew pale, and she gently bowed her head in consent.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will try then,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201C--Everybody knows what few think\r\nabout, that once there lived a man who, in the broad face of prejudiced\r\nrespectability, truth-hating hypocrisy, common-place religion, and\r\ndull book-learning, affirmed that he knew the secret of life, and\r\nunderstood the heart and history of men--who wept over their sorrows,\r\nyet worshipped the God of the whole earth, saying that he had known him\r\nfrom eternal days. The same said that he came to do what the Father\r\ndid, and that he did nothing but what he had learned of the Father.\r\nThey killed him, you know, my lady, in a terrible way that one is\r\nafraid even to think of. But he insisted that he laid down his life;\r\nthat he allowed them to take it. Now I ask whether that grandest thing,\r\ncrowning his life, the yielding of it to the hand of violence, he had\r\nnot learned also from his Father. Was his death the only thing he had\r\nnot so learned? If I am right, and I do not say _if_ in doubt, then the\r\nsuffering of those three terrible hours was a type of the suffering of\r\nthe Father himself in bringing sons and daughters through the cleansing\r\nand glorifying fires, without which the created cannot be made the very\r\nchildren of God, partakers of the divine nature and peace. Then from\r\nthe lowest, weakest tone of suffering, up to the loftiest pitch, the\r\ndivinest acme of pain, there is not one pang to which the sensorium of\r\nthe universe does not respond; never an untuneful vibration of nerve\r\nor spirit but thrills beyond the brain or the heart of the sufferer to\r\nthe brain, the heart of the universe; and God, in the simplest, most\r\nliteral, fullest sense, and not by sympathy alone, suffers _with_ his\r\ncreatures.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, but he is able to bear it; they are not: I cannot bring myself\r\nto see the right of it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNor will you, my lady, so long as you cannot bring yourself to see\r\nthe good they get by it.--My lady, when I was trying my best with poor\r\nKelpie, you would not listen to me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are ungenerous,\u201D said Clementina, flushing.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady,\u201D persisted Malcolm, \u201Cyou would not understand me. You\r\ndenied me a heart because of what seemed in your eyes cruelty. I\r\nknew that I was saving her from death at the least, probably from a\r\nlife of torture: God may be good, though to you his government may\r\nseem to deny it. There is but one way God cares to govern--the way\r\nof the Father-king--and that way is at hand.--But I have yet given\r\nyou only the one half of my theory: If God feels pain, then he puts\r\nforth his will to bear and subject that pain; if the pain comes to\r\nhim from his creature, living in him, will the endurance of God be\r\nconfined to himself, and not, in its turn, pass beyond the bounds of\r\nhis individuality, and react upon the sufferer to his sustaining? I\r\ndo not mean that sustaining which a man feels from knowing his will\r\none with God\u2019s and God _with_ him, but such sustaining as those his\r\ncreatures also may have who do not or cannot know whence the sustaining\r\ncomes. I believe that the endurance of God goes forth to uphold, that\r\nhis patience is strength to his creatures, and that, while the whole\r\ncreation may well groan, its suffering is more bearable therefore than\r\nit seems to the repugnance of our regard.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is a dangerous doctrine,\u201D said Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill it then make the cruel man more cruel to be told that God is\r\ncaring for the tortured creature from the citadel of whose life he\r\nwould force an answer to save his own from the sphinx that must at last\r\ndevour him, let him answer ever so wisely? Or will it make the tender\r\nless pitiful to be consoled a little in the agony of beholding what\r\nthey cannot alleviate? Many hearts are from sympathy as sorely in need\r\nof comfort as those with whom they suffer. And to such I have one word\r\nmore--to your heart, my lady, if it will consent to be consoled: The\r\nanimals, I believe, suffer less than we, because they scarcely think of\r\nthe past, and not at all of the future. It is the same with children,\r\nMr Graham says; they suffer less than grown people, and for the same\r\nreason. To get back something of this privilege of theirs, we have to\r\nbe obedient and take no thought for the morrow.\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina took up her work. Malcolm walked away.\r\n\r\n\u201CMalcolm,\u201D cried his mistress, \u201Care you not going on with the book?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI hope your ladyship will excuse me,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CI would rather\r\nnot read more just at present.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt may seem incredible that one so young as Malcolm should have been\r\nable to talk thus, and indeed my report may have given words more\r\nformal and systematic than his really were. For the _matter_ of them,\r\nit must be remembered that he was not young in the effort to do and\r\nunderstand; and that the advantage to such a pupil of such a teacher as\r\nMr Graham is illimitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nA PERPLEXITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Malcolm\u2019s departure, Clementina attempted to find what Florimel\r\nthought of the things her strange groom had been saying: she found\r\nonly that she neither thought at all about them, nor had a single true\r\nnotion concerning the matter of their conversation. Seeking to interest\r\nher in it and failing, she found however that she had greatly deepened\r\nits impression upon herself.\r\n\r\nFlorimel had not yet quite made up her mind whether or not she should\r\nopen her heart to Clementina, but she approached the door of it in\r\nrequesting her opinion upon the matter of marriage between persons of\r\nsocial conditions widely parted--\u201Cfrightfully sundered,\u201D she said. Now\r\nClementina was a radical of her day, a reformer, a leveller--one who\r\ncomplained bitterly that some should be so rich, and some so poor. In\r\nthis she was perfectly honest. Her own wealth, from a vague sense of\r\nunrighteousness in the possession of it, was such a burden to her,\r\nthat she threw it away where often it made other people stumble if\r\nnot fall. She professed to regard all men as equal, and believed that\r\nshe did so. She was powerful in her contempt of the distinctions made\r\nbetween certain of the classes, but had signally failed in some bold\r\nendeavours to act as if they had no existence except in the whims\r\nof society. As yet no man had sought her nearer regard for whom she\r\nwould deign to cherish even friendship. As to marriage, she professed,\r\nright honestly, an entire disinclination, even aversion to it, saying\r\nto herself that if ever she should marry it must be, for the sake of\r\nprotest and example, one notably beneath her in social condition. He\r\nmust be a gentleman, but his claims to that rare distinction should lie\r\nonly in himself, not his position--in what he was, not what he had. But\r\nit is one thing to have opinions, and another to be called upon to show\r\nthem beliefs; it is one thing to declare all men equal, and another to\r\ntell the girl who looks up to you for advice, that she ought to feel\r\nherself at perfect liberty to marry--say a groom; and when Florimel\r\nproposed the general question, Clementina might well have hesitated.\r\nAnd indeed she did hesitate--but in vain she tried to persuade herself\r\nthat it was solely for the sake of her young and inexperienced friend\r\nthat she did so. As little could she honestly say that it was from\r\ndoubt of the principles she had so long advocated. Had Florimel been\r\nopen with her, and told her what sort of inferior was in her thoughts,\r\ninstead of representing the gulf between them as big enough to swallow\r\nthe city of Rome; had she told her that he was a gentleman, a man of\r\ngenius and gifts, noble and large-hearted, and indeed better-bred than\r\nany other man she knew, the fact of his profession would only have\r\nclenched Lady Clementina\u2019s decision in his favour; and if Florimel had\r\nbeen honest enough to confess the encouragement she had given him--nay,\r\nthe absolute love-passages there had been, Clementina would at once\r\nhave insisted that her friend should write an apology for her behaviour\r\nto him, should dare the dastard world, and offer to marry him when\r\nhe would. But, Florimel putting the question as she did, how should\r\nClementina imagine anything other than that it referred to Malcolm?\r\nand a strange confusion of feeling was the consequence. Her thoughts\r\nheaved in her like the half-shaped monsters of a spiritual chaos, and\r\namongst them was one she could not at all identify. A direct answer\r\nshe found impossible. She found also that in presence of Florimel, so\r\nmuch younger than herself, and looking up to her for advice, she dared\r\nnot even let the questions now pressing for entrance appear before her\r\nconsciousness. She therefore declined giving an answer of any sort--was\r\nnot prepared with one, she said; much was to be considered; no two\r\ncases were just alike.\r\n\r\nThey were summoned to tea, after which she retired to her room, shut\r\nthe door, and began to think--an operation which, seldom easy if worth\r\nanything, was in the present case peculiarly difficult, both because\r\nClementina was not used to it, and the subject-object of it was\r\nherself. I suspect that self-examination is seldom the most profitable,\r\ncertainly it is sometimes the most unpleasant, and always the most\r\ndifficult of moral actions--that is, to perform after a genuine\r\nfashion. I know that very little of what passes for it has the remotest\r\nclaim to reality; and I will not say it has never to be done; but I am\r\ncertain that a good deal of the energy spent by some devout and upright\r\npeople on trying to understand themselves and their own motives, would\r\nbe expended to better purpose, and with far fuller attainment even in\r\nregard to that object itself, in the endeavour to understand God, and\r\nwhat he would have us to do.\r\n\r\nLady Clementina\u2019s attempt was as honest as she dared make it. It went\r\nsomething after this fashion:\r\n\r\n\u201CHow is it possible I should counsel a young creature like that, with\r\nall her gifts and privileges, to marry a groom--to bring the stable\r\ninto her chamber? If I did--if she did, has she the strength to hold\r\nher face to it?--Yes, I know how different he is from any other groom\r\nthat ever rode behind a lady! but does she understand him? Is she\r\ncapable of such a regard for him as could outlast a week of closer\r\nintimacy? At her age it is impossible she should know what she was\r\ndoing in daring such a thing. It would be absolute ruin to her. And how\r\ncould I advise her to do what I could not do myself?--But then if she\u2019s\r\nin love with him?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe rose and paced the room--not hurriedly--she never did anything\r\nhurriedly--but yet with unleisurely steps, until, catching sight\r\nof herself in the glass, she turned away as from an intruding and\r\nunwelcome presence, and threw herself on her couch, burying her face\r\nin the pillow. Presently, however, she rose again, her face glowing,\r\nand again walked up and down the room--almost swiftly now. I can but\r\nindicate the course of her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf what he says be true!--It opens another and higher life. --What\r\na man he is! and so young!--Has he not convicted me of feebleness\r\nand folly, and made me ashamed of myself?--What better thing could\r\nman or woman do for another than lower her in her own haughty eyes,\r\nand give her a chance of becoming such as she had but dreamed of the\r\nshadow of?--He is a gentleman--every inch! Hear him talk!--Scotch, no\r\ndoubt,--and--well--a _little_ long-winded--a bad fault at his age!\r\nBut see him ride!--see him swim!--and to save a bird!--But then he is\r\nhard--severe at best! All religious people are so severe! They think\r\nthey are safe themselves, and so can afford to be hard on others! He\r\nwould serve his wife the same as his mare if he thought she required\r\nit!--And I _have_ known women for whom it might be the best thing. I am\r\na fool! a soft-hearted idiot! He told me I would give a baby a lighted\r\ncandle if it cried for it.--Or didn\u2019t he? I believe he never uttered a\r\nword of the sort; he only thought it.\u201D--As she said this, there came\r\na strange light in her eyes, and the light seemed to shine from all\r\naround them as well as from the orbs themselves.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she stood still as a statue in the middle of the room, and\r\nher face grew white as the marble of one. For a minute she stood\r\nthus--without a definite thought in her brain. The first that came\r\nwas something like this: \u201CThen Florimel _does_ love him!--and wants\r\nhelp to decide whether she shall marry him or not! Poor weak little\r\nwretch!--Then if I were in love with him, I would marry him--would\r\nI?--It is well, perhaps, that I\u2019m not!--But she! he is ten times too\r\ngood for her! He would be utterly thrown away on her! But I am _her_\r\ncounsel, not his; and what better could come to her than have such\r\na man for a husband; and instead of that contemptible Liftore, with\r\nhis grand earldom ways and proud nose! He has little to be proud of\r\nthat must take to his rank for it! Fancy a right man condescending to\r\nbe proud of his own rank! Pooh! But this groom is a man! all a man!\r\ngrand from the centre out, as the great God made him!--Yes, it must\r\nbe a great God that made such a man as that!--that is, if he _is_ the\r\nsame he looks--the same all through!--Perhaps there are more Gods than\r\none, and one of them is the devil, and made Liftore! But am I bound to\r\ngive her advice? Surely not! I may refuse. And rightly too! A woman\r\nthat marries from advice, instead of from a mighty love, is wrong. I\r\nneed _not_ speak. I shall just tell her to consult her own heart-- and\r\nconscience, and follow them.--But, gracious me! Am _I_ then going to\r\nfall in love with the fellow?--this stable-man who pretends to know his\r\nmaker! Certainly not. There is _nothing_ of the kind in my thoughts.\r\nBesides, how should _I_ know what falling in love means? I never was in\r\nlove in my life, and don\u2019t mean to be. If I were so foolish as imagine\r\nmyself in any danger, would I be such a fool as be caught in it? I\r\nshould think not indeed! What if I _do_ think of this man in a way I\r\nnever thought of anyone before, is there anything odd in that? How\r\nshould I help it when he is unlike anyone I ever saw before? One must\r\nthink of people as one finds them. Does it follow that I have power\r\nover myself no longer, and must go where any chance feeling may choose\r\nto lead me?\u201D\r\n\r\nHere came a pause. Then she started, and once more began walking up and\r\ndown the room, now hurriedly indeed.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will _not_ have it!\u201D she cried aloud--and checked herself, dashed at\r\nthe sound of her own voice. But her soul went on loud enough for the\r\nthought-universe to hear. \u201CThere _can\u2019t_ be a God, or he would never\r\nsubject his women to what they don\u2019t choose. If a God had made them,\r\nhe would have them queens over themselves at least-- and I _will_ be\r\nqueen, and then perhaps a God did make me. A slave to things inside\r\nmyself!--thoughts and feelings I refuse, and which I _ought_ to have\r\ncontrol over! I don\u2019t want this in me, yet I can\u2019t drive it out! I\r\n_will_ drive it out. It is not me. A slave on my own ground! worst\r\nslavery of all!--It will not go.--That must be because I do not will\r\nit strong enough. And if I don\u2019t _will_ it --my God!--what does that\r\nmean?--That I am a slave already?\u201D\r\n\r\nAgain she threw herself on her couch, but only to rise and yet again\r\npace the room.\r\n\r\n\u201CNonsense! it is _not_ love. It is merely that nobody could help\r\nthinking about one who had been so much before her mind for so long\r\n--one too who had made her think. Ah! there, I do believe, lies the\r\nreal secret of it all!--There\u2019s the main cause of my trouble --and\r\nnothing worse! I must not be foolhardy though, and remain in danger,\r\nespecially as, for anything I can tell, he may be in love with that\r\nfoolish child. People, they say, like people that are not at all like\r\nthemselves. Then I am sure he might like me!--She _seems_ to be in love\r\nwith him! I know she cannot be half a quarter in real love with him:\r\nit\u2019s not in her.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe did not rejoin Florimel that evening: it was part of the\r\nunderstanding between the ladies that each should be at absolute\r\nliberty. She slept little during the night, starting awake as often\r\nas she began to slumber, and before the morning came was a good deal\r\nhumbled. All sorts of means are kept at work to make the children\r\nobedient and simple and noble. Joy and sorrow are servants in God\u2019s\r\nnursery; pain and delight, ecstasy and despair minister in it; but\r\namongst them there is none more marvellous in its potency than that\r\nmingling of all pains and pleasures to which we specially give the name\r\nof Love.\r\n\r\nWhen she appeared at breakfast, her countenance bore traces of her\r\nsuffering, but a headache, real enough, though little heeded in the\r\ncommotion upon whose surface it floated, gave answer to the not very\r\nsympathetic solicitude of Florimel. Happily the day of their return\r\nwas near at hand. Some talk there had been of protracting their stay,\r\nbut to that Clementina avoided any farther allusion. She must put an\r\nend to an intercourse which she was compelled to admit was, at least,\r\nin danger of becoming dangerous. This much she had with certainty\r\ndiscovered concerning her own feelings, that her heart grew hot and\r\ncold at the thought of the young man belonging more to the mistress who\r\ncould not understand him than to herself who imagined she could; and it\r\nwanted no experience in love to see that it was therefore time to be on\r\nher guard against herself, for to herself she was growing perilous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE MIND OF THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next was the last day of the reading. They must finish the tale\r\nthat morning, and on the following set out to return home, travelling\r\nas they had come. Clementina had not the strength of mind to deny\r\nherself that last indulgence--a long four days\u2019 ride in the company of\r\nthis strangest of attendants. After that, if not the deluge, yet a few\r\nmiles of Sahara.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018It is the opinion of many that he has entered into a Moravian\r\nmission, for the use of which he had previously drawn considerable\r\nsums,\u2019\u201D read Malcolm, and paused, with book half closed.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that all?\u201D asked Florimel.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot quite, my lady,\u201D he answered. \u201CThere isn\u2019t much more, but I was\r\njust thinking whether we hadn\u2019t come upon something worth a little\r\nreflection--whether we haven\u2019t here a window into the mind of the\r\nauthor of Waverley, whoever he may be, Mr Scott, or another.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou mean?\u201D said Clementina, interrogatively, and looked up from her\r\nwork, but not at the speaker.\r\n\r\n\u201CI mean, my lady, that perhaps we here get a glimpse of the author\u2019s\r\nown opinions, or feelings rather, perhaps.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do not see what of the sort you can find there,\u201D returned Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CNeither should I, my lady, if Mr Graham had not taught me how to find\r\nShakspere in his plays. A man\u2019s own nature, he used to say, must lie\r\nat the heart of what he does, even though not another man should be\r\nsharp enough to find him there. Not a hypocrite, the most consummate,\r\nhe would say, but has his hypocrisy written in every line of his\r\ncountenance and motion of his fingers. The heavenly Lavaters can read\r\nit, though the earthly may not be able.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you think you can find him out?\u201D said Clementina, dryly.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot the hypocrite, my lady, but Mr Scott here. He is only round a\r\nsingle corner. And one thing is--he believes in a God.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do you make that out?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe means this Mr Tyrrel for a fine fellow, and on the whole approves\r\nof him--does he not, my lady?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf course all that duelling is wrong. But then Mr Scott only half\r\ndisapproves of it.--And it is almost a pity it is wrong,\u201D remarked\r\nMalcolm with a laugh; \u201Cit is such an easy way of settling some\r\ndifficult things. Yet I hate it. It\u2019s so cowardly. I may be a better\r\nshot than the other, and know it all the time. He may know it too,\r\nand have twice my courage. And I may think him in the wrong, when he\r\n_knows_ himself in the right.--There _is_ one man I have felt as if I\r\nshould like to kill. When I was a boy I killed the cats that ate my\r\npigeons.\u201D\r\n\r\nA look of horror almost distorted Lady Clementina\u2019s countenance.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what to say next, my lady,\u201D he went on, with a smile,\r\n\u201Cbecause I have no way of telling whether you looked shocked for the\r\ncats I killed, or the pigeons they killed, or the man I would rather\r\nsee killed than have him devour more of my--white doves,\u201D he concluded\r\nsadly, with a little shake of the head.--\u201CBut, please God,\u201D he resumed,\r\n\u201CI shall manage to keep them from him, and let him live to be as old as\r\nMethuselah if he can, even if he should grow in cunning and wickedness\r\nall the time. I wonder how he will feel when he comes to see what a\r\nsneaking cat he is. But this is not what we set out for.--Mr Tyrrel,\r\nthen, the author\u2019s hero, joins the Moravians at last.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat are they?\u201D questioned Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CSimple, good, practical Christians, I believe,\u201D answered Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut he only does it when disappointed in love.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, my lady; he is not disappointed. The lady is only dead.\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina stared a moment--then dropped her head as if she understood.\r\nPresently she raised it again and said,\r\n\r\n\u201CBut, according to what you said the other day, in doing so he was\r\nforsaking altogether the duties of the station in which God had called\r\nhim.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is true. It would have been a far grander thing to do his duty\r\nwhere he was, than to find another place and another duty. An earldom\r\nallotted is better than a mission preferred.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd at least you must confess,\u201D interrupted Clementina, \u201Cthat he only\r\ntook to religion because he was unhappy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly, my lady, it is the nobler thing to seek God in the days of\r\ngladness, to look up to him in trustful bliss when the sun is shining.\r\nBut if a man be miserable, if the storm is coming down on him, what is\r\nhe to do? There is nothing mean in seeking God then, though it would\r\nhave been nobler to seek him before.--But to return to the matter\r\nin hand: the author of Waverley makes his noble-hearted hero, whom\r\nassuredly he had no intention of disgracing, turn Moravian; and my\r\nconclusion from it is that, in his judgment, nobleness leads in the\r\ndirection of religion; that he considers it natural for a noble mind to\r\nseek comfort there for its deepest sorrows.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, it may be so; but what is religion without consistency in\r\naction?\u201D said Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CNothing,\u201D answered Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen how can you, professing to believe as you do, cherish such\r\nfeelings towards any man as you have just been confessing?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t cherish them, my lady. But I succeed in avoiding hate better\r\nthan suppressing contempt, which perhaps is the worse of the two. There\r\nmay be some respect in hate.\u201D\r\n\r\nHere he paused, for here was a chance that was not likely to recur.\r\nHe might say before two ladies what he could not say before one. If\r\nhe could but rouse Florimel\u2019s indignation! Then at any suitable time\r\nonly a word more would be needful to direct it upon the villain.\r\nClementina\u2019s eyes continued fixed upon him. At length he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will try to make two pictures in your mind, my lady, if you will\r\nhelp me to paint them. In _my_ mind they are not _painted_ pictures.\r\n--A long sea-coast, my lady, and a stormy night;--the sea-horses\r\nrushing in from the north-east, and the snow-flakes beginning to fall.\r\nOn the margin of the sea a long dune or sand-bank, and on the top of\r\nit, her head bare, and her thin cotton dress nearly torn from her by\r\nthe wind, a young woman, worn and white, with an old faded tartan shawl\r\ntight about her shoulders, and the shape of a baby inside it, upon her\r\narm.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh! she doesn\u2019t mind the cold,\u201D said Florimel. \u201CWhen I was there, I\r\ndidn\u2019t mind it a bit.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe does not mind the cold,\u201D answered Malcolm; \u201Cshe is far too\r\nmiserable for that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut she has no business to take the baby out on such a night,\u201D\r\ncontinued Florimel, carelessly critical. \u201CYou ought to have painted her\r\nby the fireside. They have all of them firesides to sit at. I have seen\r\nthem through the windows many a time.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShame or cruelty had driven her from it,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cand there she\r\nwas.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you mean you saw her yourself wandering about?\u201D asked Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CTwenty times, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina was silent.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, what comes next?\u201D said Florimel.\r\n\r\n\u201CNext comes a young gentleman;--but this is a picture in another frame,\r\nalthough of the same night;--a young gentleman in evening dress,\r\nsipping his madeira, warm and comfortable, in the bland temper that\r\nshould follow the best of dinners, his face beaming with satisfaction\r\nafter some boast concerning himself, or with silent success in the\r\nconcoction of one or two compliments to have at hand when he joins the\r\nladies in the drawing-room.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNobody can help such differences,\u201D said Florimel. \u201CIf there were\r\nnobody rich, who would there be to do anything for the poor? It\u2019s not\r\nthe young gentleman\u2019s fault that he is better born and has more money\r\nthan the poor girl.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Malcolm; \u201Cbut what if the poor girl has the young\r\ngentleman\u2019s child to carry about from morning to night.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, well! I suppose she\u2019s paid for it,\u201D said Florimel, whose innocence\r\nmust surely have been supplemented by some stupidity, born of her\r\nflippancy.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo be quiet, Florimel,\u201D said Clementina. \u201CYou don\u2019t know what you are\r\ntalking about.\u201D\r\n\r\nHer face was in a glow, and one glance at it set Florimel\u2019s in a flame.\r\nShe rose without a word, but with a look of mingled confusion and\r\noffence, and walked away. Clementina gathered her work together. But\r\nere she followed her, she turned to Malcolm, looked him calmly in the\r\nface, and said,\r\n\r\n\u201CNo one can blame you for hating such a man.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed, my lady, but some one would--the only one for whose praise or\r\nblame we ought to care more than a straw or two. He tells us we are\r\nneither to judge nor to hate. But--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot stay and talk with you,\u201D said Clementina. \u201CYou must pardon me\r\nif I follow your mistress.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnother moment and he would have told her all, in the hope of her\r\nwarning Florimel. But she was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nTHE RIDE HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorimel was offended with Malcolm: he had put her confidence in him\r\nto shame, speaking of things to which he ought not once to have even\r\nalluded. But Clementina was not only older than Florimel, but in her\r\nloving endeavours for her kind, had heard many a pitiful story, and was\r\nnow saddened by the tale, not shocked at the teller. Indeed, Malcolm\u2019s\r\nmode of acquainting her with the grounds of the feeling she had\r\nchallenged pleased both her heart and her sense of what was becoming;\r\nwhile, as a partisan of women, finding a man also of their part, she\r\nwas ready to offer him the gratitude of all womankind--in her one\r\ntypical self.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a rough diamond is here!\u201D she thought.\r\n\r\n\u201CRough!\u201D echoed her heart: \u201Chow is he rough? What fault could the\r\nmost fastidious find with his manners? True, he speaks as a servant\r\n--and where would be his manners if he did not? But neither in tone,\r\nexpression, nor way of thinking, is he in the smallest degree servile.\r\nHe is like a great pearl, clean out of the sea--bred, it is true, in\r\nthe midst of strange surroundings, but pure as the moonlight; and if\r\na man, so environed, yet has grown so grand, what might he not become\r\nwith such privileges as----!\u201D\r\n\r\nGood Clementina--what did she mean? Did she imagine that such mere\r\ngifts as she might give him, could do more for him than the great sea,\r\nwith the torment and conquest of its winds and tempests? more than his\r\nown ministrations of love, and victories over passion and pride? What\r\nthe final touches of the shark-skin are to the marble that stands lord\r\nof the flaming bow, that only can wealth and position be to the man\r\nwho has yielded neither to the judgments of the world nor the drawing\r\nof his own inclinations, and so has submitted himself to the chisel\r\nand mallet of his maker. Society is the barber who trims a man\u2019s hair,\r\noften very badly too--and pretends he made it grow. If her owner should\r\ntake her, body and soul, and make of her being a gift to his--ah, then,\r\nindeed! But Clementina was not yet capable of perceiving that, while\r\nwhat she had in her thought to offer _might_ hurt him, it _could_ do\r\nhim little good. Her feeling concerning him, however, was all the time\r\nfar indeed from folly. Not for a moment did she imagine him in love\r\nwith her. Possibly she admired him too much to attribute to him such\r\nan intolerable and insolent presumption as that would have appeared to\r\nher own inferior self. Still, she was far indeed from certain, were\r\nshe, as befits the woman so immeasurably beyond even the aspiration of\r\nthe man, to make him offer implicit of hand and havings, that he would\r\nreach out his to take them. And certainly that she was not going to\r\ndo--in which determination, whether she knew it or not, there was as\r\nmuch modesty and gracious doubt of her own worth as there was pride and\r\nmaidenly recoil. In one resolve she was confident, that her behaviour\r\ntowards him should be such as to keep him just where he was, affording\r\nhim no smallest excuse for taking one step nearer: and they would soon\r\nbe in London, where she would see nothing, or next to nothing more of\r\nhim. But should she ever cease to thank God, that was, if ever she came\r\nto find him, that in this groom he had shown her what he could do in\r\nthe way of making a man! Heartily she wished she knew a nobleman or two\r\nlike him. In the meantime she meant to enjoy--with carefulness --the\r\nride to London, after which things should be as before.\r\n\r\nThe morning arrived; they finished breakfast; the horses came round\r\nand stood at the door--all but Kelpie. The ladies mounted. Ah, what a\r\nmorning to leave the country and go back to London! The sun shone clear\r\non the dark pine-woods; the birds were radiant in song; all under the\r\ntrees the ferns were unrolling each its mystery of ever generating\r\nlife; the soul of the summer was there whose mere idea sends the heart\r\ninto the eyes, while itself flits mocking from the cage of words. A\r\ngracious mystery it was--in the air, in the sun, in the earth, in their\r\nown hearts. The lights of heaven mingled and played with the shadows\r\nof the earth, which looked like the souls of the trees that had been\r\nout wandering all night, and had been overtaken by the sun ere they\r\ncould re-enter their dark cells. Every motion of the horses under them\r\nwas like a throb of the heart of the earth, every bound like a sigh\r\nof her bliss. Florimel shouted almost like a boy with ecstasy, and\r\nClementina\u2019s moonlight went very near changing into sunlight as she\r\ngazed, and breathed, and knew that she was alive.\r\n\r\nThey started without Malcolm, for he must always put his mistress up,\r\nand then go back to the stable for Kelpie. In a moment they were in the\r\nwood, crossing its shadows. It was like swimming their horses through\r\na sea of shadows. Then came a little stream and the horses splashed it\r\nabout like children from very gamesomeness. Half a mile more and there\r\nwas a saw-mill, with a mossy wheel, a pond behind, dappled with sun and\r\nshade, a dark rush of water along a brown trough, and the air full of\r\nthe sweet smell of sawn wood. Clementina had not once looked behind,\r\nand did not know whether Malcolm had yet joined them or not. All at\r\nonce the wild vitality of Kelpie filled the space beside her, and the\r\nvoice of Malcolm was in her ears. She turned her head. He was looking\r\nvery solemn.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you let me tell you, my lady, what this always makes me think\r\nof?\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat in particular do you mean?\u201D returned Clementina coldly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis smell of new-sawn wood that fills the air, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt makes me think of Jesus in his father\u2019s workshop,\u201D said Malcolm\r\n\u201C--how he must have smelled the same sweet scent of the trees of the\r\nworld broken for the uses of men, that is now so sweet to me. Oh, my\r\nlady! it makes the earth very holy and very lovely to think that as\r\nwe are in the world, so was he in the world. Oh, my lady! think:--if\r\nGod should be so nearly one with us that it was nothing strange to him\r\nthus to visit his people! that we are not the offspring of the soulless\r\ntyranny of law that knows not even its own self, but the children of an\r\nunfathomable wonder, of which science gathers only the foambells on the\r\nshore--children in the house of a living Father, so entirely our Father\r\nthat he cares even to death that we should understand and love him!\u201D\r\n\r\nHe reined Kelpie back, and as she passed on, his eyes caught a glimmer\r\nof emotion in Clementina\u2019s. He fell behind, and all that day did not\r\ncome near her again.\r\n\r\nFlorimel asked her what he had been saying, and she compelled herself\r\nto repeat a part of it.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is always saying such odd out-of-the-way things!\u201D remarked\r\nFlorimel. \u201CI used sometimes, like you, to fancy him a little astray,\r\nbut I soon found I was wrong. I wish you could have heard him tell a\r\nstory he once told my father and me. It was one of the wildest you ever\r\nheard. I can\u2019t tell to this day whether he believed it himself or not.\r\nHe told it quite as if he did.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCould you not make him tell it again, as we ride along? It would\r\nshorten the way.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you want the way shortened?--I don\u2019t. But indeed it would not do to\r\ntell it so. It ought to be heard just where I heard it--at the foot of\r\nthe ruined castle where the dreadful things in it took place. You must\r\ncome and see me at Lossie House in the autumn, and then he shall tell\r\nit you. Besides, it ought to be told in Scotch, and there you will soon\r\nlearn enough to follow it: half the charm depends on that.\u201D\r\n\r\nAlthough Malcolm did not again approach Clementina that day, he\r\nwatched almost her every motion as she rode. Her lithe graceful back\r\nand shoulders--for she was a rebel against the fashion of the day in\r\ndress as well as in morals, and, believing in the natural stay of the\r\nmuscles, had found them responsive to her trust-- the noble poise of\r\nher head, and the motions of her arms, easy yet decided, were ever\r\npresent to him, though sometimes he could hardly have told whether his\r\nsight or his mind--now in the radiance of the sun, now in the shadow of\r\nthe wood, now against the green of the meadow, now against the blue of\r\nthe sky, and now in the faint moonlight, through which he followed, as\r\na ghost in the realms of Hades might follow the ever flitting phantom\r\nof his love. Day glided after day. Adventure came not near them. Soft\r\nand lovely as a dream the morning dawned, the noon flowed past, the\r\nevening came and the death that followed was yet sweeter than the life\r\nthat had gone before. Through it all, day-dream and nightly trance,\r\nradiant air and moony mist, before him glode the shape of Clementina,\r\nits every motion a charm. After that shape he could have been content,\r\noh, how content! to ride on and on through the ever unfolding vistas of\r\nan eternal succession. Occasionally his mistress would call him to her,\r\nand then he would have one glance of the day-side of the wondrous world\r\nhe had been following. Somewhere within it must be the word of the\r\nliving One. Little he thought that all the time she was thinking more\r\nof him who had spoken that word in her hearing. That he was the object\r\nof her thoughts not a suspicion crossed the mind of the simple youth.\r\nHow could he imagine a lady like her taking a fancy to what, for all\r\nhis marquisate, he was still in his own eyes, a raw young fisherman,\r\nonly just learning how to behave himself decently! No doubt, ever since\r\nshe began to listen to reason, the idea of her had been spreading like\r\na sweet odour in his heart, but not because she had listened to _him_.\r\nThe very fulness of his admiration had made him wrathful with the\r\nintellectual dishonesty--for in her it could not be stupidity--that\r\nquenched his worship, and the first dawning sign of a _reasonable_\r\nsoul drew him to her feet, where, like Pygmalion before his statue, he\r\ncould have poured out his heart in thanks, that she consented to be a\r\nwoman. But even the intellectual phantom, nay, even the very phrase\r\nof being in love with her, had never risen upon the dimmest verge of\r\nhis consciousness--and that although her being had now become to him\r\nof all but absorbing interest. I say _all but_, because Malcolm knew\r\nsomething of One whose idea she was, who had uttered her from the\r\nimmortal depths of his imagination. The man to whom no window into the\r\ntreasures of the Godhead has yet been opened, may well scoff at the\r\nnotion of such a love, for he has this advantage, that, while one like\r\nMalcolm can never cease to love, he, gifted being, can love to-day and\r\nforget to-morrow--or next year--where is the difference? Malcolm\u2019s\r\nmain thought was--what a grand thing it would be to rouse a woman like\r\nClementina to lift her head into the\r\n\r\n\r\n        regions mild of calm and serene air,\r\n  Above the smoke and stir of this dim spot\r\n  Which men call Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone think that love has no right to talk religion, I answer for\r\nMalcolm at least, asking, Whereof shall a man speak, if not out of the\r\nabundance of his heart? That man knows little either of love or of\r\nreligion who imagines they ought to be kept apart. Of what sort, I ask,\r\nis either, if unfit to approach the other? Has God decreed, created a\r\nlove that must separate from himself? Is Love then divided? Or shall\r\nnot love to the heart created, lift up the heart to the Heart creating?\r\nAlas for the love that is not treasured in heaven! for the moth and the\r\nrust will devour it. Ah, these pitiful old moth-eaten loves!\r\n\r\nAll the journey then Malcolm was thinking how to urge the beautiful\r\nlady into finding for herself whether she had a father in heaven or\r\nnot. A pupil of Mr Graham, he placed little value in argument that ran\r\nin any groove but that of persuasion, or any value in persuasion that\r\nhad any end but action.\r\n\r\nOn the second day of the journey, he rode up to his mistress, and told\r\nher, taking care that Lady Clementina should hear, that Mr Graham\r\nwas now preaching in London, adding that for his part he had never\r\nbefore heard anything fit to call preaching. Florimel did not show\r\nmuch interest, but asked where, and Malcolm fancied he could see Lady\r\nClementina make a mental note of the place.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf only,\u201D he thought, \u201Cshe would let the power of that man\u2019s faith\r\nhave a chance of influencing her, all would be well.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe ladies talked a good deal, but Florimel was not in earnest about\r\nanything, and for Clementina to have turned the conversation upon those\r\npossibilities, dim-dawning through the chaos of her world, which had\r\nbegun to interest her, would have been absurd--especially since such\r\nwas her confusion and uncertainty, that she could not tell whether\r\nthey were clouds or mountains, shadows or continents. Besides, why\r\ngive a child sovereigns to play with when counters or dominoes would\r\ndo as well? Clementina\u2019s thoughts could not have passed into Florimel,\r\nand become her thoughts. Their hearts, their natures must come nearer\r\nfirst. Advise Florimel to disregard rank, and marry the man she loved!\r\nAs well counsel the child to give away the cake he would cry for with\r\nintensified selfishness the moment he had parted with it! Still, there\r\nwas that in her feeling for Malcolm which rendered her doubtful in\r\nFlorimel\u2019s presence.\r\n\r\nBetween the grooms little passed. Griffith\u2019s contempt for Malcolm found\r\nits least offensive expression in silence, its most offensive in the\r\nshape of his countenance. He could not make him the simplest reply\r\nwithout a sneer. Malcolm was driven to keep mostly behind. If by any\r\nchance he got in front of his fellow-groom, Griffith would instantly\r\ncross his direction and ride between him and the ladies. His look\r\nseemed to say he had to protect them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nPORTLAND PLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the journey was not so pleasant: it rained. It was\r\nnot cold, however, and the ladies did not mind it much. It accorded\r\nwith Clementina\u2019s mood; and as to Florimel, but for the thought of\r\nmeeting Caley, her fine spirits would have laughed the weather to\r\nscorn. Malcolm was merry. His spirits always rose at the appearance\r\nof bad weather, as indeed with every show of misfortune a response\r\nantagonistic invariably awoke in him. On the present occasion he had\r\neven to repress the constantly recurring impulse to break out in\r\nsong. His bosom\u2019s lord sat lightly in his throne. Griffith was the\r\nonly miserable one of the party. He was tired, and did not relish the\r\nthought of the work to be done before getting home. They entered London\r\nin a wet fog, streaked with rain, and dyed with smoke. Florimel went\r\nwith Clementina for the night, and Malcolm carried a note from her to\r\nLady Bellair, after which, having made Kelpie comfortable, he went to\r\nhis lodgings.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the curiosity-shop, the woman received him with evident\r\nsurprise, and when he would have passed through to the stair, stopped\r\nhim with the unwelcome information that, finding he did not return, and\r\nknowing nothing about himself or his occupation, she had, as soon as\r\nthe week for which he had paid in advance was out, let the room to an\r\nold lady from the country.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is no great matter to me,\u201D said Malcolm, thoughtful over the\r\nwoman\u2019s want of confidence in him, for he had rather liked her, \u201Conly I\r\nam sorry you could not trust me a little.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s all you know, young man,\u201D she returned. \u201CPeople as lives in\r\nLondon must take care of theirselves--not wait for other people to do\r\nit. They\u2019d soon find theirselves nowheres in partic\u2019lar. I\u2019ve took care\r\non your things, an\u2019 laid \u2019em all together, an\u2019 the sooner you find\r\nanother place for \u2019em the better, for they do take up a deal o\u2019 room.\u201D\r\n\r\nHis personal property was not so bulky, however, but that in ten\r\nminutes he had it all in his carpet-bag and a paper parcel, carrying\r\nwhich he re-entered the shop.\r\n\r\n\u201CWould you oblige me by allowing these to lie here till I come for\r\nthem?\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nThe woman was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019d rather see the last on \u2019em,\u201D she answered. \u201CTo tell the truth,\r\nI don\u2019t like the look on \u2019em. You acts a part, young man. I\u2019m on the\r\nsquare myself. But you\u2019ll find plenty to take you in.--No, I can\u2019t do\r\nit. Take \u2019em with you.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm turned from her, and with his bag in one hand and the parcel\r\nunder the other arm, stepped from the shop into the dreary night. There\r\nhe stood in the drizzle. It was a by-street into which gas had not\r\nyet penetrated, and the oil lamps shone red and dull through the fog.\r\nHe concluded to leave the things with Merton, while he went to find a\r\nlodging.\r\n\r\nMerton was a decent sort of fellow--_not_ in his master\u2019s confidence,\r\nand Malcolm found him quite as sympathetic as the small occasion\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt ain\u2019t no sort o\u2019 night,\u201D he said, \u201Cto go lookin\u2019 for a bed. Let\u2019s\r\ngo an\u2019 speak to my old woman: she\u2019s a oner at contrivin\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe lived over the stable, and they had but to go up the stair. Mrs\r\nMerton sat by the fire. A cradle with a baby was in front of it. On the\r\nother side sat Caley, in suppressed exultation, for here came what she\r\nhad been waiting for--the first fruits of certain arrangements between\r\nher and Mrs Catanach. She greeted Malcolm distantly, but neither\r\ndisdainfully nor spitefully.\r\n\r\n\u201CI trust you\u2019ve brought me back my lady, MacPhail,\u201D she said; then\r\nadded, thawing into something like jocularity, \u201CI shouldn\u2019t have looked\r\nto you to go running away with her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI left my lady at Lady Clementina Thornicroft\u2019s an hour ago,\u201D answered\r\nMalcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, of course! Lady Clem\u2019s everything now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI believe my lady\u2019s not coming home till to-morrow,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CAll the better for us,\u201D returned Caley. \u201CHer room ain\u2019t ready for\r\nher.--But I didn\u2019t know you lodged with Mrs Merton, MacPhail,\u201D she\r\nsaid, with a look at the luggage he had placed on the floor.\r\n\r\n\u201CLawks, miss!\u201D cried the good woman, \u201Cwherever should we put him up, as\r\nhas but the next room?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll have to find that out, mother,\u201D said Merton. \u201CSure you\u2019ve got\r\nenough to shake down for him! With a truss of straw to help, you\u2019ll\r\nmanage it somehow--eh, old lady?--I\u2019ll be bound!\u201D And with that he told\r\nMalcolm\u2019s condition.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I suppose we must manage it somehow,\u201D answered his wife, \u201Cbut\r\nI\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t make him over-comfortable.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t see but we _could_ take him in at the house,\u201D said Caley,\r\nreflectively. \u201CThere is a small room empty in the garret, I know. It\r\nain\u2019t much more than a closet, to be sure, but if he could put up with\r\nit for a night or two, just till he found a better, I would run across\r\nand see what they say.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm wondered at the change in her, but could not hesitate. The\r\nleast chance of getting settled in the house was a thing not to be\r\nthrown away. He thanked her heartily. She rose and went, and they sat\r\nand talked till her return. She had been delayed, she said, by the\r\nhousekeeper; \u201Cthe cross old patch\u201D had objected to taking in anyone\r\nfrom the stables.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure,\u201D she went on, \u201Cthere ain\u2019t the ghost of a reason why you\r\nshouldn\u2019t have the room, except that it ain\u2019t good enough. Nobody else\r\nwants it, or is likely to. But it\u2019s all right now, and if you\u2019ll come\r\nacross in about an hour, you\u2019ll find it ready for you. One of the\r\ngirls in the kitchen--I forget her name--offered to make it tidy for\r\nyou. Only take care--I give you warning: she\u2019s a great admirer of Mr\r\nMacPhail.\u201D\r\n\r\nTherewith she took her departure, and at the appointed time Malcolm\r\nfollowed her. The door was opened to him by one of the maids whom\r\nhe knew by sight, and in her guidance he soon found himself in that\r\npart of a house he liked best--immediately under the roof. The room\r\nwas indeed little more than a closet in the slope of the roof with\r\nonly a sky-light. But just outside the door was a storm-window, from\r\nwhich, over the top of a lower range of houses, he had a glimpse\r\nof the mews-yard. The place smelt rather badly of mice, while, as\r\nthe sky-light was immediately above his bed, and he had no fancy\r\nfor drenching that with an infusion of soot, he could not open it.\r\nThese, however, were the sole faults he had to find with the place.\r\nEverything looked nice and clean, and his education had not tended to\r\nfastidiousness. He took a book from his bag, and read a good while;\r\nthen went to bed, and fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he woke early, as was his habit, sprang at once on\r\nthe floor, dressed, and went quietly down. The household was yet\r\nmotionless. He had begun to descend the last stair, when all at once\r\nhe turned deadly sick, and had to sit down, grasping the balusters. In\r\na few minutes he recovered, and made the best speed he could to the\r\nstable, where Kelpie was now beginning to demand her breakfast.\r\n\r\nBut Malcolm had never in his life before felt sick, and it seemed awful\r\nto him. Something that had appeared his own, a portion --hardly a\r\nportion, rather an essential element of himself--had suddenly deserted\r\nhim, left him a prey to the inroad of something that was not of\r\nhimself, bringing with it faintness of heart, fear and dismay. He found\r\nhimself for the first time in his life trembling; and it was to him a\r\nthing as appalling as strange. While he sat on the stair he could not\r\nthink; but as he walked to the mews he said to himself:\r\n\r\n\u201CAm I then the slave of something that is not myself--something to\r\nwhich my fancied freedom and strength are a mockery? Was my courage,\r\nmy peace, all the time dependent on something not me, which could be\r\nseparated from me, and but a moment ago was separated from me, and\r\nleft me as helplessly dismayed as the veriest coward in creation? I\r\nwonder what Alexander would have thought if, as he swung himself on\r\nBucephalus, he had been taken as I was on the stair.\u201D\r\n\r\nAfterwards, talking the thing over with Mr Graham, he said:\r\n\r\n\u201CI saw that I had no hand in my own courage. If I had any courage, it\r\nwas simply that I was born with it. If it left me, I could not help\r\nit: I could neither prevent nor recall it; I could only wait until it\r\nreturned. Why, then, I asked myself, should I feel ashamed that, for\r\nfive minutes, as I sat on the stair, Kelpie was a terror to me, and I\r\nfelt as if I dared not go near her? I had almost reached the stable\r\nbefore I saw into it a little. Then I did see that if I had had nothing\r\nto do with my own courage, it was quite time I had something to do with\r\nit. If a man had no hand in his own nature, character, being, what\r\ncould he be better than a divine puppet--a happy creature, possibly--a\r\nheavenly animal, like the grand horses and lions of the book of the\r\nRevelation--but not one of the gods that the sons of God, the partakers\r\nof the divine nature, are? For this end came the breach in my natural\r\ncourage-- that I might repair it from the will and power God had given\r\nme, that I might have a hand in the making of my own courage, in the\r\ncreating of myself. Therefore I must see to it.\u201D\r\n\r\nNor had he to wait for his next lesson, namely, the opportunity of\r\ndoing what he had been taught in the first. For just as he reached\r\nthe stable, where he heard Kelpie clamouring with hoofs and teeth,\r\nafter her usual manner when she judged herself neglected, the sickness\r\nreturned, and with it such a fear of the animal he heard thundering and\r\nclashing on the other side of the door, as amounted to nothing less\r\nthan horror. She was a man-eating horse!--a creature with bloody teeth,\r\nbrain-spattered hoofs, and eyes of hate! A flesh-loving devil had\r\npossessed her and was now crying out for her groom that he might devour\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe gathered, with agonized effort, every power within him to an awful\r\ncouncil, and thus he said to himself:\r\n\r\n\u201CBetter a thousand times my brain plastered the stable-wall than I\r\nshould hold them in the head of a dastard. How can God look at me with\r\nany content if I quail in the face of his four-footed creature! Does\r\nhe not demand of me action according to what I _know_, not what I may\r\nchance at any moment to _feel_? God is my strength, and I will lay hold\r\nof that strength and use it, or I have none, and Kelpie may take me and\r\nwelcome.\u201D\r\n\r\nTherewith the sickness abated so far that he was able to open the\r\nstable-door; and, having brought them once into the presence of their\r\nterror, his will arose and lorded it over his shrinking quivering\r\nnerves, and like slaves they obeyed him. Surely the Father of his\r\nspirit was most in that will when most that will was Malcolm\u2019s own!\r\nIt is when a man is most a man, that the cause of the man, the God\r\nof his life, the very Life himself, the original life-creating Life,\r\nis closest to him, is most within him. The individual, that his\r\nindividuality may blossom, and not soon be \u201Cmassed into the common\r\nclay,\u201D must have the vital indwelling of the primary Individuality\r\nwhich is its origin. The fire that is the hidden life of the bush will\r\nnot consume it.\r\n\r\nMalcolm tottered to the corn-bin, staggered up to Kelpie, fell up\r\nagainst her hind quarters as they dropped from a great kick, but got\r\ninto the stall beside her. She turned eagerly, darted at her food,\r\nswallowed it greedily, and was quiet as a lamb while he dressed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nPORTLOSSIE AND SCAURNOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime things were going rather badly at Portlossie and Scaurnose;\r\nand the factor was the devil of them. Those who had known him longest\r\nsaid he must be _fey_, that is _doomed_, so strangely altered was\r\nhis behaviour. Others said he took more counsel with his bottle than\r\nhad been his wont, and got no good from it. Almost all the fishers\r\nfound him surly, and upon some he broke out in violent rage, while\r\nto certain whom he regarded as Malcolm\u2019s special friends, he carried\r\nhimself with cruel oppression. The notice to leave at midsummer clouded\r\nthe destiny of Joseph Mair and his family, and every householder in\r\nthe two villages believed that to take them in would be to call down\r\nthe like fate upon himself. But Meg Partan at least was not to be\r\nintimidated. Her outbursts of temper were but the hurricanes of a\r\ntropical heart--not much the less true and good and steadfast that\r\nit was fierce. Let the factor rage as he would, Meg was absolute in\r\nher determination that, if the cruel sentence was carried out, which\r\nshe hardly expected, her house should be the shelter of those who had\r\nreceived her daughter when her severity had driven her from her home.\r\nThat would leave her own family and theirs three months to look out\r\nfor another abode. Certain of Blue Peter\u2019s friends ventured a visit\r\nof intercession to the factor, and were received with composure and\r\ntreated with consideration until their object appeared, when his wrath\r\nburst forth so wildly that they were glad to escape without having\r\nto defend their persons: only the day before had he learned with\r\ncertainty from Miss Horn that Malcolm was still in the service of the\r\nmarchioness, and in constant attendance upon her when she rode. It\r\nalmost maddened him. He had for some time taken to drinking more toddy\r\nafter his dinner, and it was fast ruining his temper: his wife, who had\r\nfrom the first excited his indignation against Malcolm, was now reaping\r\nher reward. To complete the troubles of the fisher-folk, the harbour at\r\nPortlossie had, by a severe equinoctial storm, been so filled with sand\r\nas to be now inaccessible at lower than half tide, nobody as yet having\r\nmade it his business to see it attended to.\r\n\r\nBut, in the midst of his anxieties about Florimel and his interest in\r\nClementina, Malcolm had not been forgetting them. As soon as he was\r\na little settled in London, he had written to Mr Soutar, and he to\r\narchitects and contractors, on the subject of a harbour at Scaurnose.\r\nBut there were difficulties, and the matter had been making but slow\r\nprogress. Malcolm, however, had insisted, and in consequence of his\r\ndetermination to have the possibilities of the thing thoroughly\r\nunderstood, three men appeared one morning on the rocks at the bottom\r\nof the cliff on the west side of the Nose. The children of the village\r\ndiscovered them, and carried the news; whereupon, the men being all\r\nout in the bay, the women left their work and went to see what the\r\nstrangers were about. The moment they were satisfied that they could\r\nmake nothing of their proceedings, they naturally became suspicious.\r\nTo whom the fancy first occurred, nobody ever knew, but such was the\r\nunhealthiness of the moral atmosphere of the place, caused by the\r\ninjustice and severity of Mr Crathie, that, once suggested, it was\r\nuniversally received that they were sent by the factor--and that for\r\na purpose only too consistent with the treatment Scaurnose, they\r\nsaid, had invariably received ever since first it was the dwelling of\r\nfishers! Had not their fathers told them how unwelcome they were to the\r\nlords of the land? And what rents had they not to pay! and how poor was\r\nthe shelter for which they did so much--without a foot of land to grow\r\na potato in! To crown all, the factor was at length about to drive them\r\nin a body from the place--Blue Peter first, one of the best as well as\r\nthe most considerable men among them! His notice to quit was but the\r\nbeginning of a clearance. It was easy to see what those villains were\r\nabout--on that precious rock, their only friend, the one that did its\r\nbest to give them the sole shadow of harbourage they had, cutting off\r\nthe wind from the north-east a little, and breaking the eddy round the\r\npoint of the Nose! What _could_ they be about but marking the spots\r\nwhere to bore the holes for the blasting-powder that should scatter it\r\nto the winds, and let death and destruction, and the wild sea howling\r\nin upon Scaurnose, that the cormorant and the bittern might possess\r\nit, the owl and the raven dwell in it? But it would be seen what their\r\nhusbands and fathers would say to it when they came home! In the\r\nmeantime they must themselves do what they could. What were they men\u2019s\r\nwives for, if not to act for their husbands when they happened to be\r\naway?\r\n\r\nThe result was a shower of stones upon the unsuspecting surveyors,\r\nwho forthwith fled, and carried the report of their reception to Mr\r\nSoutar at Duff Harbour. He wrote to Mr Crathie, who till then had heard\r\nnothing of the business; and the news increased both his discontent\r\nwith his superiors, and his wrath with those whom he had come to regard\r\nas his rebellious subjects. The stiff-necked people of the Bible was to\r\nhim always now, as often he heard the words, the people of Scaurnose\r\nand the Seaton of Portlossie. And having at length committed this\r\novert outrage, would he not be justified by all in taking more active\r\nmeasures against them?\r\n\r\nWhen the fishermen came home and heard how their women had conducted\r\nthemselves, they accepted their conjectures, and approved of their\r\ndefence of the settlement. It was well for the land-loupers, they said,\r\nthat they had only the women to deal with.\r\n\r\nBlue Peter did not so soon hear of the affair as the rest, for his\r\nAnnie had not been one of the assailants. But when the hurried retreat\r\nof the surveyors was described to him in somewhat graphic language by\r\none of those concerned in causing it, he struck his clenched fist in\r\nthe palm of his other hand, and cried,\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel saired! There! that\u2019s what comes o\u2019 yer new----\u201D\r\n\r\nHe had all but broken his promise, as he had already broken his faith\r\nto Malcolm, when his wife laid her hand on his mouth and stopped the\r\nissuing word. He started with sudden conviction and stood for a moment\r\nin absolute terror at sight of the precipice down which he had been\r\non the point of falling, then straightway excusing himself to his\r\nconscience on the ground of non intent, was instantly angrier with\r\nMalcolm than before. He could not reflect that the disregarded cause\r\nof the threatened sin was the greater sin of the two. The breach of\r\nthat charity which thinketh no evil may be a graver fault than a hasty\r\nbreach of promise.\r\n\r\nPeter had not been improving since his return from London. He found\r\nless satisfaction in his _religious exercises_; was not unfrequently\r\nclouded in temper, occasionally even to sullenness; referred things\r\noftener than formerly to the vileness of the human nature, but was far\r\nless willing than before to allow that he might himself be wrong; while\r\nsomehow the Bible had no more the same plenitude of relation to the\r\nwants of his being, and he rose from the reading of it unrefreshed. Men\r\nasked each other what had come to Blue Peter, but no one could answer\r\nthe question. For himself, he attributed the change, which he could not\r\nbut recognise, although he did not understand it, to the withdrawing\r\nof the spirit of God, in displeasure that he had not merely allowed\r\nhimself to be inveigled into a playhouse, but, far worse, had enjoyed\r\nthe wickedness he saw there. When his wife reasoned that God knew he\r\nhad gone in ignorance, trusting his friend, he cried,\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s that to him wha judges richteous judgment? What\u2019s a\u2019 oor puir\r\nmeeserable excuzes i\u2019 the een \u2019at can see throu\u2019 the wa\u2019s o\u2019 the hert!\r\nIgnorance is no innocence.\u201D\r\n\r\nThus he lied for God, pleading his cause on the principles of hell. But\r\nthe eye of his wife was single, and her body full of light; therefore\r\nto her it was plain that neither the theatre nor his conscience\r\nconcerning it was the cause of the change: it had to do with his\r\nfeelings towards Malcolm. He wronged his friend in his heart, half knew\r\nit, but would not own it. Fearing to search himself, he took refuge\r\nin resentment, and to support his hard judgment, put false and cruel\r\ninterpretations on whatever befell. So that, with love and anger and\r\nwrong acknowledged, his heart was full of bitterness.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a\u2019 the drumblet (_muddied, troubled_) luve o\u2019 \u2019im!\u201D said Annie\r\nto herself. \u201CPuir fallow! gien only Ma\u2019colm wad come hame, an\u2019 lat him\r\nken he\u2019s no the villain he taks him for. I\u2019ll no believe mysel\u2019 \u2019at the\r\nlaad I kissed like my ain mither\u2019s son afore he gaed awa\u2019 wad turn like\r\nthat upo\u2019 \u2019s \u2019maist the meenute he was oot o\u2019 sicht, an\u2019 a\u2019 for a feow\r\nwords aboot a fulish play-actin\u2019. Lord bliss us a\u2019! markises is men!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll see, Peter, my man,\u201D she said, when the neighbour took her\r\nleave, \u201Cwhether the wife, though she hasna been to the ill place, an\u2019\r\nthat\u2019s surely Lon\u2019on, canna tell the true frae the fause full better\r\nnor her man, \u2019at kens sae muckle mair nor she wants to ken? Lat sit an\u2019\r\nlat see.\u201D\r\n\r\nBlue Peter made no reply; but perhaps the deepest depth in his fall\r\nwas that he _feared_ his wife might be right, and he have one day to\r\nstand ashamed before both her and his friend. But there are marvellous\r\ndifferences in the _quality_ of the sins of different men, and a\r\nnoble nature like Peter\u2019s would have to sink far indeed to be beyond\r\nredemption. Still there was one element mingling with his wrongness\r\nwhose very triviality increased the difficulty of long-delaying\r\nrepentance: he had been not a little proud at finding himself the\r\nfriend of a marquis. From the first they had been friends, when the one\r\nwas a youth and the other a child, and had been out together in many\r\na stormy and dangerous sea. More than once or twice, driven from the\r\nchurlish ocean to the scarce less inhospitable shore, they had lain all\r\nnight in each other\u2019s arms to keep the life awake within their frozen\r\ngarments. And now this marquis spoke English to him! It rankled!\r\n\r\nAll the time Blue Peter was careful to say nothing to injure Malcolm\r\nin the eyes of his former comrades. His manner when his name was\r\nmentioned, however, he could not honestly school to the conveyance of\r\nthe impression that things were as they had been betwixt them. Folk\r\nmarked the difference, and it went to swell the general feeling that\r\nMalcolm had done ill to forsake a seafaring life for one upon which all\r\nfishermen must look down with contempt. Some in the Seaton went so far\r\nin their enmity as even to hint at an explanation of his conduct in the\r\ntruth of the discarded scandal which had laid Lizzy\u2019s child at his door.\r\n\r\nBut amongst them was one who, having wronged him thus, and been\r\nconvinced of her error, was now so fiercely his partisan as to be\r\nready to wrong the whole town in his defence: that was Meg Partan,\r\nproperly Mistress Findlay, Lizzy\u2019s mother. Although the daughter had\r\nnever confessed, the mother had yet arrived at the right conclusion\r\nconcerning the father of her child--how, she could hardly herself have\r\ntold, for the conviction had grown by accretion; a sign here and a sign\r\nthere, impalpable save to maternal sense, had led her to the truth; and\r\nnow, if anyone had a word to say against Malcolm, he had better not say\r\nit in the hearing of the Partaness.\r\n\r\nOne day Blue Peter was walking home from the upper town of\r\nPortlossie, not with the lazy gait of the fisherman off work, poised\r\nbackwards, with hands in trouser-pocket, but stooping care-laden\r\nwith listless-swinging arms. Thus Meg Partan met him--and of course\r\nattributed his dejection to the factor.\r\n\r\n\u201CDeil ha\u2019e \u2019im for an upsettin\u2019 rascal \u2019at hasna pride eneuch to haud\r\nhim ohn lickit the gentry\u2019s shune! The man maun be fey! I houp he may,\r\nan\u2019 I wuss I saw the beerial o\u2019 \u2019im makin\u2019 for the kirkyaird. It\u2019s nae\r\nill to wuss weel to a\u2019 body \u2019at wad be left! His nose is turnt twise\r\nthe colour i\u2019 the last twa month. He\u2019ll be drinkin\u2019 byous. Gien only\r\nMa\u2019colm MacPhail had been at hame to haud him in order!\u201D\r\n\r\nPeter said nothing, and his silence, to one who spake out whatever\r\ncame, seemed fuller of restraints and meanings than it was. She\r\nchallenged it at once.\r\n\r\n\u201CNoo, what mean ye by sayin\u2019 naething, Peter? Guid kens it\u2019s the warst\r\nthing man or woman can say o\u2019 onybody to haud their tongue. It\u2019s a\r\nthing I never was blamed wi\u2019 mysel\u2019, an\u2019 I wadna du \u2019t.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s verra true,\u201D said Peter.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe mair weicht\u2019s intill \u2019t whan I lay \u2019t to the door o\u2019 anither,\u201D\r\npersisted Meg. \u201CPeter, gien ye ha\u2019e onything again\u2019 my freen\u2019 Ma\u2019colm\r\nMacPhail, oot wi\u2019 \u2019t like a man, an\u2019 no playac\u2019 the gunpoother-plot\r\nower again. Ill wull\u2019s the warst poother ye can lay i\u2019 the boddom o\u2019\r\nony man\u2019s boat. But say \u2019at ye like, I s\u2019 uphaud Ma\u2019colm again\u2019 the\r\nhaill poustie o\u2019 ye. Gien he was but here! I say \u2019t again, honest laad!\u201D\r\n\r\nBut she could not rouse Peter to utterance, and losing what little\r\ntemper she had, she rated him soundly, and sent him home saying with\r\nthe prophet Jonah, \u201CDo I not well to be angry?\u201D for that also he placed\r\nto Malcolm\u2019s account. Nor was his home any more a harbour for his riven\r\nboat, seeing his wife only longed for the return of him with whom his\r\nspirit chode: she regarded him as an exiled king, one day to reappear,\r\nand justify himself in the eyes of all, friends and enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nTORTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough unable to eat any breakfast, Malcolm persuaded himself that he\r\nfelt nearly as well as usual when he went to receive his mistress\u2019s\r\norders. Florimel had had enough of horseback--for several days to come\r\nindeed--and would not ride. So he saddled Kelpie, and rode to Chelsea\r\nto look after his boat. To get rid of the mare, he rang the stable-bell\r\nat Mr Lenorme\u2019s, and the gardener let him in. As he was putting her\r\nup, the man told him that the housekeeper had heard from his master.\r\nMalcolm went to the house to learn what he might, and found to his\r\nsurprise that, if he had gone on the continent, he was there no longer,\r\nfor the letter, which contained only directions concerning some of his\r\npictures, was dated from Newcastle, and bore the Durham postmark of a\r\nweek ago. Malcolm remembered that he had heard Lenorme speak of Durham\r\ncathedral, and in the hope that he might be spending some time there,\r\nbegged the housekeeper to allow him to go to the study to write to her\r\nmaster. When he entered, however, he saw something that made him change\r\nhis plan, and, having written, instead of sending the letter, as he\r\nhad intended, inclosed to the postmaster at Durham, he left it upon\r\nan easel. It contained merely an earnest entreaty to be made and kept\r\nacquainted with his movements, that he might at once let him know if\r\nanything should occur that he ought to be informed concerning.\r\n\r\nHe found all on board the yacht in ship-shape, only Davy was absent.\r\nTravers explained that he sent him on shore for a few hours every day.\r\nHe was a sharp boy, he said, and the more he saw, the more useful he\r\nwould be, and as he never gave him any money, there was no risk of his\r\nmistaking his hours.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen do you expect him?\u201D asked Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CAt four o\u2019clock,\u201D answered Travers.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is four now,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\nA shrill whistle came from the Chelsea shore.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd there\u2019s Davy,\u201D said Travers.\r\n\r\nMalcolm got into the dinghy and rowed ashore.\r\n\r\n\u201CDavy,\u201D he said, \u201CI don\u2019t want you to be all day on board, but I can\u2019t\r\nhave you be longer away than an hour at a time.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, ay, sir,\u201D said Davy.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow attend to me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, ay, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know Lady Lossie\u2019s house?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, sir; but I ken hersel\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow is that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI ha\u2019e seen her mair nor twa or three times, ridin\u2019 wi\u2019 yersel\u2019, to\r\nyon hoose yon\u2019er.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWould you know her again?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy wad I--fine that. What for no, sir?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a good way to see a lady across the Thames and know her again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COw! but I tuik the spy-glaiss till her,\u201D answered Davy, reddening.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are sure of her, then?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI _am_ that, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen come with me, and I will show you where she lives. I will not\r\nride faster than you can run. But mind you don\u2019t look as if you\r\nbelonged to me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNa, na, sir. There\u2019s fowk takin\u2019 nottice.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you mean by that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a wee laddie been efter mysel\u2019 twise or thrice.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you do anything?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe wasna big eneuch to lick, sae I jist got him the last time an\u2019 pu\u2019d\r\nhis niz, an\u2019 I dinna think he\u2019ll come efter me again.\u201D\r\n\r\nTo see what the boy could do, Malcolm let Kelpie go at a good trot: but\r\nDavy kept up without effort, now shooting ahead, now falling behind,\r\nnow stopping to look in at a window, and now to cast a glance at a\r\ngame of pitch and toss. No mere passer-by could have suspected that\r\nthe sailor-boy belonged to the horseman. He dropped him not far from\r\nPortland Place, telling him to go and look at the number, but not stare\r\nat the house.\r\n\r\nAll the time he had had no return of the sickness, but, although thus\r\nactively occupied, had felt greatly depressed. One main cause of\r\nthis was, however, that he had not found his religion stand him in\r\nsuch stead as he might have hoped. It was not yet what it must be to\r\nprove its reality. And now his eyes were afresh opened to see that\r\nin his nature and thoughts lay large spaces wherein God ruled not\r\nsupreme--desert places, where who could tell what might appear? For\r\nin such regions wild beasts range, evil herbs flourish, and demons go\r\nabout. If in very deed he lived and moved and had his being in God,\r\nthen assuredly there ought not to be one cranny in his nature, one\r\nrealm of his consciousness, one well-spring of thought, where the will\r\nof God was a stranger. If all were as it should be, then surely there\r\nwould be no moment, looking back on which he could not at least say,\r\n\r\n\r\n  Yet like some sweet beguiling melody,\r\n  So sweet, we know not we are listening to it,\r\n  Thou, the meanwhile, wast blending with my thought,\r\n  Yea, with my life and life\u2019s own secret joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CIn that agony o\u2019 sickness, as I sat upo\u2019 the stair,\u201D he said to\r\nhimself, for still in his own thoughts he spoke his native tongue,\r\n\u201Cwhaur was my God in a\u2019 my thouchts? I did cry till \u2019im, I min\u2019 weel,\r\nbut it was my reelin\u2019 brain an\u2019 no my trustin\u2019 hert \u2019at cried. Aih me!\r\nI doobt gien the Lord war to come to me noo, he wadna fin\u2019 muckle faith\r\ni\u2019 my pairt o\u2019 the yerth. Aih! I wad like to lat him see something like\r\nlippenin\u2019! I wad fain trust him till his hert\u2019s content. But I doobt\r\nit\u2019s only speeritual ambeetion, or better wad hae come o\u2019 \u2019t by this\r\ntime. Gien that sickness come again, I maun see, noo \u2019at I\u2019m forewarned\r\no\u2019 my ain wakeness, what I can du. It maun be something better nor last\r\ntime, or I\u2019ll tine hert a\u2019thegither. Weel, maybe I need to be heumblet.\r\nThe Lord help me!\u201D\r\n\r\nIn the evening he went to the schoolmaster, and gave him a pretty full\r\naccount of where he had been and what had taken place since last he saw\r\nhim, dwelling chiefly on his endeavours with Lady Clementina.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr Graham\u2019s lodging to the north-eastern gate of the Regent\u2019s\r\nPark, the nearest way led through a certain passage, which, although a\r\nthoroughfare to persons on foot, was little known. Malcolm had early\r\ndiscovered it, and always used it. Part of this short cut was the\r\nyard and back-premises of a small public-house. It was between eleven\r\nand twelve as he entered it for the second time that night. Sunk in\r\nthought and suspecting no evil, he was struck down from behind, and\r\nlost his consciousness. When he came to himself he was lying in the\r\npublic house, with his head bound up, and a doctor standing over him,\r\nwho asked him if he had been robbed. He searched his pockets, and\r\nfound that his old watch was gone, but his money left. One of the\r\nmen standing about said he would see him home. He half thought he\r\nhad seen him before, and did not like the look of him, but accepted\r\nthe offer, hoping to get on the track of something thereby. As soon\r\nas they entered the comparative solitude of the park he begged his\r\ncompanion, who had scarcely spoken all the way, to give him his arm,\r\nand leaned upon it as if still suffering, but watched him closely.\r\nAbout the middle of the park, where not a creature was in sight, he\r\nfelt him begin to fumble in his coat-pocket, and draw something from\r\nit. But when, unresisted, he snatched away his other arm, Malcolm\u2019s\r\nfist followed it, and the man fell, nor made any resistance while he\r\ntook from him a short stick, loaded with lead, and his own watch, which\r\nhe found in his waistcoat-pocket. Then the fellow rose with apparent\r\ndifficulty, but the moment he was on his legs, ran like a hare, and\r\nMalcolm let him run, for he felt unable to follow him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he reached home, he went to bed, for his head ached\r\nseverely; but he slept pretty well, and in the morning flattered\r\nhimself he felt much as usual. But it was as if all the night that\r\nhorrible sickness had been lying in wait on the stair to spring upon\r\nhim, for, the moment he reached the same spot on his way down, he\r\nalmost fainted. It was worse than before. His very soul seemed to turn\r\nsick. But although his heart died within him, somehow, in the confusion\r\nof thought and feeling occasioned by intense suffering, it seemed while\r\nhe clung to the balusters as if with both hands he were clinging to the\r\nskirts of God\u2019s garment; and through the black smoke of his fainting,\r\nhis soul seemed to be struggling up towards the light of his being.\r\nPresently the horrible sense subsided as before, and again he sought\r\nto descend the stair and go to Kelpie. But immediately the sickness\r\nreturned, and all he could do after a long and vain struggle, was to\r\ncrawl on hands and knees up the stairs and back to his room. There he\r\ncrept upon his bed, and was feebly committing Kelpie to the care of her\r\nmaker, when consciousness forsook him.\r\n\r\nIt returned, heralded by frightful pains all over his body, which by\r\nand by subsiding, he sank again to the bottom of the black Lethe.\r\n\r\nMeantime Kelpie had got so wildly uproarious that Merton tossed her\r\nhalf a truss of hay, which she attacked like an enemy, and ran to the\r\nhouse to get somebody to call Malcolm. After what seemed endless delay,\r\nthe door was opened by his admirer, the scullery-maid, who, as soon as\r\nshe heard what was the matter, hastened to his room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nTHE PHILTRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore he again came to himself, Malcolm had a dream, which, although\r\nvery confused, was in parts more vivid than any he had ever had. His\r\nsurroundings in it were those in which he actually lay, and he was ill,\r\nbut he thought it the one illness he had before. His head ached, and he\r\ncould rest in no position he tried. Suddenly he heard a step he knew\r\nbetter than any other approaching the door of his chamber: it opened,\r\nand his grandfather in great agitation entered, not following his\r\nhands, however, in the fashion usual to blindness, but carrying himself\r\nlike any sight-gifted man. He went straight to the wash-stand, took up\r\nthe water-bottle, and with a look of mingled wrath and horror dashed it\r\non the floor. The same instant a cold shiver ran through the dreamer,\r\nand his dream vanished. But instead of waking in his bed, he found\r\nhimself standing in the middle of the floor, his feet wet, the bottle\r\nin shivers about them, and, strangest of all, the neck of the bottle in\r\nhis hand. He lay down again, grew delirious, and tossed about in the\r\nremorseless persecution of centuries. But at length his tormentors left\r\nhim, and when he came to himself, he knew he was in his right mind.\r\n\r\nIt was evening, and some one was sitting near his bed. By the light of\r\nthe long-snuffed tallow candle, he saw the glitter of two great black\r\neyes watching him, and recognised the young woman who had admitted him\r\nto the house the night of his return, and whom he had since met once or\r\ntwice as he came and went. The moment she perceived that he was aware\r\nof her presence, she threw herself on her knees at his bedside, hid her\r\nface, and began to weep. The sympathy of his nature rendered yet more\r\nsensitive by weakness and suffering, Malcolm laid his hand on her head,\r\nand sought to comfort her.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t be alarmed about me,\u201D he said, \u201CI shall soon be all right again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t bear it,\u201D she sobbed. \u201CI can\u2019t bear to see you like that, and\r\nall my fault.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C_Your_ fault! What _can_ you mean?\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I did go for the doctor, for all it may be the hanging of me,\u201D she\r\nsobbed. \u201CMiss Caley said I wasn\u2019t to, but I would and I did. They can\u2019t\r\nsay I meant it--can they?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t understand,\u201D said Malcolm, feebly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe doctor says somebody\u2019s been an\u2019 p\u2019isoned you,\u201D said the girl, with\r\na cry that sounded like a mingled sob and howl; \u201Can\u2019 he\u2019s been a-pokin\u2019\r\nof all sorts of things down your poor throat.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd again she cried aloud in her agony.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, never mind; I\u2019m not dead you see; and I\u2019ll take better care of\r\nmyself after this. Thank you for being so good to me; you\u2019ve saved my\r\nlife.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! you won\u2019t be so kind to me when you know all, Mr MacPhail,\u201D sobbed\r\nthe girl. \u201CIt was myself gave you the horrid stuff, but God knows I\r\ndidn\u2019t mean to do you no harm no more than your own mother.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat made you do it then?\u201D asked Malcolm:\r\n\r\n\u201CThe witch-woman told me to. She said that--that--if I gave it you--you\r\nwould--you would----\u201D\r\n\r\nShe buried her face in the bed, and so stifled a fresh howl of pain and\r\nshame.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd it was all lies--lies!\u201D she resumed, lifting her face again, which\r\nnow flashed with rage, \u201Cfor I know you\u2019ll hate me worse than ever now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy poor girl, I never hated you,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, but you did as bad: you never looked at me. And now you\u2019ll hate me\r\nout and out. And the doctor says if you die, he\u2019ll have it all searched\r\ninto, and Miss Caley she look at me as if she suspect me of a hand in\r\nit; and they won\u2019t let alone till they\u2019ve got me hanged for it; and\r\nit\u2019s all along of love of you; and I tell you the truth, Mr MacPhail,\r\nand you can do anything with me you like --I don\u2019t care--only you won\u2019t\r\nlet them hang me--will you?--Oh, please don\u2019t.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe said all this with clasped hands, and the tears streaming down her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nMalcolm\u2019s impulse was of course to draw her to him and comfort her, but\r\nsomething warned him.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, you see I\u2019m not going to die just yet,\u201D he said as merrily as he\r\ncould; \u201Cand if I find myself going, I shall take care the blame falls\r\non the right person. What was the witch-woman like? Sit down on the\r\nchair there, and tell me all about her.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe obeyed with a sigh, and gave him such a description as he could\r\nnot mistake. He asked where she lived, but the girl had never met her\r\nanywhere but in the street, she said.\r\n\r\nQuestioning her very carefully as to Caley\u2019s behaviour to her, Malcolm\r\nwas convinced that she had a hand in the affair. Indeed, she had\r\nhappily more to do with it than even Mrs Catanach knew, for she had\r\ntraversed her treatment to the advantage of Malcolm. The mid-wife had\r\nmeant the potion to work slowly, but the lady\u2019s-maid had added to the\r\npretended philtre a certain ingredient in whose efficacy she had reason\r\nto trust; and the combination, while it wrought more rapidly, had yet\r\napparently set up a counteraction favourable to the efforts of the\r\nstruggling vitality which it stung to an agonised resistance.\r\n\r\nBut Malcolm\u2019s strength was now exhausted. He turned faint, and the\r\ngirl had the sense to run to the kitchen and get him some soup. As he\r\ntook it, her demeanour and regards made him anxious, uncomfortable,\r\nembarrassed. It is to any true man a hateful thing to repel a woman\r\n--it is such a reflection upon her.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve told you everything, Mr MacPhail, and it\u2019s gospel truth I\u2019ve told\r\nyou,\u201D said the girl, after a long pause.--It was a relief when first\r\nshe spoke, but the comfort vanished as she went on, and with slow,\r\nperhaps unconscious movements approached him.--\u201CI would have died for\r\nyou, and here that devil of a woman has been making me kill you! Oh,\r\nhow I hate her! Now you will never love me a bit---not one tiny little\r\nbit for ever and ever!\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was a tone of despairful entreaty in her words that touched\r\nMalcolm deeply.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am more indebted to you than I can speak or you imagine,\u201D he said.\r\n\u201CYou have saved me from my worst enemy. Do not tell any other what you\r\nhave told me, or let anyone know that we have talked together. The day\r\nwill come when I shall be able to show you my gratitude.\u201D\r\n\r\nSomething in his tone struck her, even through the folds of her\r\npassion. She looked at him a little amazed, and for a moment the tide\r\nebbed. Then came a rush that overmastered her. She flung her hands\r\nabove her head, and cried,\r\n\r\n\u201CThat means you will do anything but love me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot love you as you mean,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CI promise to be your\r\nfriend, but more is out of my power.\u201D\r\n\r\nA fierce light came into the girl\u2019s eyes. But that instant a terrible\r\ncry, such as Malcolm had never heard, but which he knew must be\r\nKelpie\u2019s, rang through the air, followed by the shouts of men, the\r\ntones of fierce execration, and the clash and clang of hoofs.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood God!\u201D he exclaimed, and forgetting everything else, sprang from\r\nthe bed, and ran to the window outside his door.\r\n\r\nThe light of their lanterns dimly showed a confused crowd in the yard\r\nof the mews, and amidst the hellish uproar of their coarse voices he\r\ncould hear Kelpie plunging and kicking. Again she uttered the same\r\nringing scream. He threw the window open and cried to her that he\r\nwas coming, but the noise was far too great for his enfeebled voice.\r\nHurriedly he added a garment or two to his half-dress, rushed to the\r\nstair, passing his new friend, who watched anxiously at the head of it,\r\nwithout seeing her, and shot from the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nTHE DEMONESS AT BAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the yard of the mews, the uproar had nothing abated.\r\nBut when he cried out to Kelpie, through it all came a whinny of\r\nappeal, instantly followed by a scream. When he got up to the lanterns,\r\nhe found a group of wrathful men with stable-forks surrounding the poor\r\nanimal, from whom the blood was streaming before and behind. Fierce as\r\nshe was, she dared not move, but stood trembling, with the sweat of\r\nterror pouring from her. Yet her eye showed that not even terror had\r\ncowed her. She was but biding her time. Her master\u2019s first impulse was\r\nto scatter the men right and left, but on second thoughts, of which\r\nhe was even then capable, he saw that they might have been driven to\r\napparent brutality in defence of their lives, and besides he could not\r\ntell what Kelpie might do if suddenly released. So he caught her by the\r\nbroken halter, and told them to fall back. They did so carefully--it\r\nseemed unwillingly. But the mare had eyes and ears only for her master.\r\nWhat she had never done before, she nosed him over face and shoulders,\r\ntrembling all the time. Suddenly one of her tormentors darted forward,\r\nand gave her a terrible prod in the off hind quarter. But he paid\r\ndearly for it. Ere he could draw back, she lashed out, and shot him\r\nhalf across the yard with his knee joint broken. The whole set of them\r\nrushed at her.\r\n\r\n\u201CLeave her alone,\u201D shouted Malcolm, \u201Cor I will take her part. Between\r\nus we\u2019ll do for a dozen of you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe devil\u2019s in her,\u201D said one of them.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll find more of him in that rascal groaning yonder. You had better\r\nsee to him. He\u2019ll never do such a thing again, I fancy. Where is\r\nMerton?\u201D\r\n\r\nThey drew off and went to help their comrade, who lay senseless.\r\n\r\nWhen Malcolm would have led Kelpie in, she stopped suddenly at the\r\nstable-door, and started back shuddering, as if the memory of what\r\nshe had endured there overcame her. Every fibre of her trembled. He\r\nsaw that she must have been pitifully used before she broke loose and\r\ngot out. But she yielded to his coaxing, and he led her to her stall\r\nwithout difficulty. He wished Lady Clementina herself could have been\r\nhis witness how she knew her friend and trusted him. Had she seen how\r\nthe poor bleeding thing rejoiced over him, she could not have doubted\r\nthat his treatment had been in part at least a success.\r\n\r\nKelpie had many enemies amongst the men of the mews. Merton had gone\r\nout for the evening, and they had taken the opportunity of getting into\r\nher stable and tormenting her. At length she broke her fastenings; they\r\nfled, and she rushed out after them.\r\n\r\nThey carried the maimed man to the hospital, where his leg was\r\nimmediately amputated.\r\n\r\nMalcolm washed and dried his poor animal, handling her as gently as\r\npossible, for she was in a sad plight. It was plain he must not have\r\nher here any longer: worse to her at least was sure to follow. He went\r\nup, trembling himself now, to Mrs Merton. She told him she was just\r\nrunning to fetch him when he arrived: she had no idea how ill he was.\r\nBut he felt all the better for the excitement, and after he had taken\r\na cup of strong tea, wrote to Mr Soutar to provide men on whom he\r\ncould depend, if possible the same who had taken her there before, to\r\nawait Kelpie\u2019s arrival at Aberdeen. There he must also find suitable\r\nhousing and attention for her at any expense until further directions,\r\nor until, more probably, he should claim her himself. He added many\r\ninstructions to be given as to her treatment.\r\n\r\nUntil Merton returned he kept watch, then went back to the chamber of\r\nhis torture, which, like Kelpie, he shuddered to enter. The cook let\r\nhim in, and gave him his candle, but hardly had he closed his door when\r\na tap came to it, and there stood Rose, his preserver. He could not\r\nhelp feeling embarrassed when he saw her.\r\n\r\n\u201CI see you don\u2019t trust me,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do trust you,\u201D he answered. \u201CWill you bring me some water. I dare\r\nnot drink anything that has been standing.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with inquiring eyes, nodded her head, and went. When\r\nshe returned, he drank the water.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere! you see I trust you,\u201D he said with a laugh. \u201CBut there are\r\npeople about who for certain reasons want to get rid of me: will you be\r\non my side?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat I will,\u201D she answered eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have not got my plans laid yet; but will you meet me somewhere near\r\nthis to-morrow night? I shall not be at home, perhaps, all day.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe stared at him with great eyes, but agreed at once, and they\r\nappointed time and place. He then bade her good night, and the moment\r\nshe left him lay down on the bed to think. But he did not trouble\r\nhimself yet to unravel the plot against him, or determine whether the\r\nviolence he had suffered had the same origin with the poisoning. Nor\r\nwas the question merely how to continue to serve his sister without\r\ndanger to his life; for he had just learned what rendered it absolutely\r\nimperative that she should be removed from her present position. Mrs\r\nMerton had told him that Lady Lossie was about to accompany Lady\r\nBellair and Lord Liftore to the continent. That must not be, whatever\r\nmeans might be necessary to prevent it. Before he went to sleep things\r\nhad cleared themselves up considerably.\r\n\r\nHe woke much better, and rose at his usual hour. Kelpie rejoiced him by\r\naffording little other sign of the cruelty she had suffered than the\r\nangry twitching of her skin when hand or brush approached a wound. The\r\nworst fear was that some few white hairs might by and by in consequence\r\nfleck her spotless black. Having urgently committed her to Merton\u2019s\r\ncare, he mounted Honour, and rode to the Aberdeen wharf. There to\r\nhis relief, time growing precious, he learned that the same smack in\r\nwhich Kelpie had come was to sail the next morning for Aberdeen. He\r\narranged at once for her passage, and, before he left, saw to every\r\ncontrivance he could think of for her safety and comfort. He warned the\r\ncrew concerning her temper, but at the same time prejudiced them in her\r\nfavour by the argument of a few sovereigns. He then rode to the Chelsea\r\nReach, where the Psyche had now grown to be a feature of the river in\r\nthe eyes of the dwellers upon its banks.\r\n\r\nAt his whistle, Davy tumbled into the dinghy like a round ball over\r\nthe gunwale, and was rowing for the shore ere his whistle had ceased\r\nringing in Malcolm\u2019s own ears. He left him with his horse, went on\r\nboard, and gave various directions to Travers; then took Davy with\r\nhim, and bought many things at different shops, which he ordered to be\r\ndelivered to Davy when he should call for them. Having next instructed\r\nhim to get everything on board as soon as possible, and appointed to\r\nmeet him at the same place and hour he had arranged with Rose, he went\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nA little anxious lest Florimel might have wanted him, for it was now\r\npast the hour at which he usually waited her orders, he learned to his\r\nrelief that she was gone shopping with Lady Bellair, upon which he set\r\nout for the hospital, whither they had carried the man Kelpie had so\r\nterribly mauled. He went, not merely led by sympathy, but urged by a\r\nsuspicion also which he desired to verify or remove. On the plea of\r\nidentification, he was permitted to look at him for a moment, but not\r\nto speak to him. It was enough: he recognised him at once as the same\r\nwhose second attack he had foiled in the Regent\u2019s Park. He remembered\r\nhaving seen him about the stable, but had never spoken to him. Giving\r\nthe nurse a sovereign, and Mr Soutar\u2019s address, he requested her to let\r\nthat gentleman know as soon as it was possible to conjecture the time\r\nof his leaving. Returning, he gave Merton a hint to keep his eye on the\r\nman, and some money to spend for him as he judged best. He then took\r\nKelpie for an airing. To his surprise she fatigued him so much that\r\nwhen he had put her up again he was glad to go and lie down.\r\n\r\nWhen it came near the time for meeting Rose and Davy, he got his\r\nthings together in the old carpet-bag, which held all he cared for,\r\nand carried it with him. As he drew near the spot, he saw Davy already\r\nthere, keeping a sharp look out on all sides. Presently Rose appeared,\r\nbut drew back when she saw Davy. Malcolm went to her.\r\n\r\n\u201CRose,\u201D he said, \u201CI am going to ask you to do me a great favour. But\r\nyou cannot except you are able to trust me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do trust you,\u201D she answered.\r\n\r\n\u201CAll I can tell you now is that you must go with that boy to-morrow.\r\nBefore night you shall know more. Will you do it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will,\u201D answered Rose. \u201CI dearly love a secret.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI promise to let you understand it, if you do just as I tell you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBe at this very spot then to-morrow morning, at six o\u2019clock. Come\r\nhere, Davy. This boy will take you where I shall tell him.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe looked from the one to the other.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll risk it,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CPut on a clean frock, and take a change of linen with you and your\r\ndressing things. No harm shall come to you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not afraid,\u201D she answered, but looked as if she would cry.\r\n\r\n\u201COf course you will not tell anyone.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will not, Mr MacPhail.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are trusting me a great deal, Rose; but I am trusting you too\r\n--more than you think.--Be off with that bag, Davy, and be here at six\r\nto-morrow morning, to carry this young woman\u2019s for her.\u201D\r\n\r\nDavy vanished.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, Rose,\u201D continued Malcolm, \u201Cyou had better go and make your\r\npreparations.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that all, sir?\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. I shall see you to-morrow. Be brave.\u201D\r\n\r\nSomething in Malcolm\u2019s tone and manner seemed to work strangely on the\r\ngirl. She gazed up at him half frightened, but submissive, and went at\r\nonce, looking, however, sadly disappointed.\r\n\r\nMalcolm had intended to go and tell Mr Graham of his plans that same\r\nnight, but he found himself too much exhausted to walk to Camden Town.\r\nAnd thinking over it, he saw that it might be as well if he took the\r\nbold measure he contemplated without revealing it to his friend, to\r\nwhom the knowledge might be the cause of inconvenience. He therefore\r\nwent home and to bed, that he might be strong for the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe rose early the next morning, and having fed and dressed Kelpie,\r\nstrapped her blanket behind her saddle, and, by all the macadamized\r\nways he could find, rode her to the wharf--near where the Thames-tunnel\r\nhad just been commenced. He had no great difficulty with her on the\r\nway, though it was rather nervous work at times. But of late her\r\nsubmission to her master had been decidedly growing. When he reached\r\nthe wharf he rode her straight along the gangway on to the deck of the\r\nsmack, as the easiest if not perhaps the safest way of getting her\r\non board. As soon as she was properly secured, and he had satisfied\r\nhimself as to the provision they had made for her, impressed upon the\r\ncaptain the necessity of being bountiful to her, and brought a loaf of\r\nsugar on board for her use, he left her with a lighter heart than he\r\nhad had ever since first he fetched her from the same deck.\r\n\r\nIt was a long way to walk home, but he felt much better, and thought\r\nnothing of it. And all the way, to his delight, the wind met him in the\r\nface. A steady westerly breeze was blowing. If God makes his angels\r\nwinds, as the Psalmist says, here was one sent to wait upon him. He\r\nreached Portland Place in time to present himself for orders at the\r\nusual hour. On these occasions, his mistress not unfrequently saw him\r\nherself; but to make sure, he sent up the request that she would speak\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am sorry to hear that you have been ill, Malcolm,\u201D she said kindly,\r\nas he entered the room, where happily he found her alone.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am quite well now, thank you, my lady,\u201D he returned. \u201CI thought\r\nyour ladyship would like to hear something I happened to come to the\r\nknowledge of the other day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes? What was that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI called at Mr Lenorme\u2019s to learn what news there might be of him. The\r\nhousekeeper let me go up to his painting-room; and what should I see\r\nthere, my lady, but the portrait of my lord marquis more beautiful than\r\never, the brown smear all gone, and the likeness, to my mind, greater\r\nthan before!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen Mr Lenorme is come home!\u201D cried Florimel, scarce attempting to\r\nconceal the pleasure his report gave her.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat I cannot say,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CHis housekeeper had a letter from\r\nhim a few days ago from Newcastle. If he is come back, I do not think\r\nshe knows it. It seems strange, for who would touch one of his pictures\r\nbut himself?--except, indeed, he got some friend to set it to rights\r\nfor your ladyship. Anyhow, I thought you would like to see it again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will go at once,\u201D Florimel said, rising hastily. \u201CGet the horses,\r\nMalcolm, as fast as you can.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf my Lord Liftore should come before we start?\u201D he suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201CMake haste,\u201D returned his mistress, impatiently.\r\n\r\nMalcolm did make haste, and so did Florimel. What precisely was in\r\nher thoughts who shall say, when she could not have told herself? But\r\ndoubtless the chance of seeing Lenorme urged her more than the desire\r\nto see her father\u2019s portrait. Within twenty minutes they were riding\r\ndown Grosvenor Place, and happily heard no following hoof-beats. When\r\nthey came near the river, Malcolm rode up to her and said,\r\n\r\n\u201CWould your ladyship allow me to put up the horses in Mr Lenorme\u2019s\r\nstable? I think I could show your ladyship a point or two that may have\r\nescaped you.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel thought for a moment, and concluded it would be less awkward,\r\nwould indeed tend rather to her advantage with Lenorme, should he\r\nreally be there, to have Malcolm with her.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well,\u201D she answered. \u201CI see no objection. I will ride round with\r\nyou to the stable, and we can go in the back way.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey did so. The gardener took the horses, and they went up to the\r\nstudy. Lenorme was not there, and everything was just as when Malcolm\r\nwas last in the room. Florimel was much disappointed, but Malcolm\r\ntalked to her about the portrait, and did all he could to bring back\r\nvivid the memory of her father. At length with a little sigh she made a\r\nmovement to go.\r\n\r\n\u201CHas your ladyship ever seen the river from the next room?\u201D said\r\nMalcolm, and, as he spoke, threw open the door of communication, near\r\nwhich they stood.\r\n\r\nFlorimel, who was always ready to _see_, walked straight into the\r\ndrawing-room, and went to a window.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is that yacht lying there still!\u201D remarked Malcolm. \u201CDoes she\r\nnot remind you of the Psyche, my lady?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEvery boat does that,\u201D answered his mistress. \u201CI dream about her. But\r\nI couldn\u2019t tell her from many another.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPeople used to boats, my lady, learn to know them like the faces of\r\ntheir friends.--What a day for a sail!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you suppose that one is for hire?\u201D said Florimel.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe can ask,\u201D replied Malcolm; and with that went to another window,\r\nraised the sash, put his head out, and whistled. Over tumbled Davy into\r\nthe dinghy at the Psyche\u2019s stern, unloosed the painter, and was rowing\r\nfor the shore ere the minute was out.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, they\u2019re answering your whistle already!\u201D said Florimel.\r\n\r\n\u201CA whistle goes farther, and perhaps is more imperative than any other\r\ncall,\u201D returned Malcolm evasively. \u201CWill your ladyship come down and\r\nhear what they say?\u201D\r\n\r\nA wave from the slow-silting lagoon of her girlhood came washing over\r\nthe sands between, and Florimel flew merrily down the stair and across\r\nhall and garden and road to the river-bank, where was a little wooden\r\nstage or landing place, with a few steps, at which the dinghy was just\r\narriving.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you take us on board and show us your boat?\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, ay, sir,\u201D answered Davy.\r\n\r\nWithout a moment\u2019s hesitation, Florimel took Malcolm\u2019s offered hand,\r\nand stepped into the boat. Malcolm took the oars, and shot the little\r\ntub across the river. When they got alongside the cutter, Travers\r\nreached down both his hands for hers, and Malcolm held one of his for\r\nher foot, and Florimel sprang on deck.\r\n\r\n\u201CYoung woman on board, Davy?\u201D whispered Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, ay, sir--doon i\u2019 the fore,\u201D answered Davy, and Malcolm stood by\r\nhis mistress.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe _is_ like the Psyche,\u201D said Florimel, turning to him, \u201Conly the\r\nmast is not so tall.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHer topmast is struck, you see my lady--to make sure of her passing\r\nclear under the bridges.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAsk them if we couldn\u2019t go down the river a little way,\u201D said\r\nFlorimel. \u201CI should so like to see the houses from it!\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm conferred a moment with Travers and returned.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey are quite willing, my lady,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat fun!\u201D cried Florimel, her girlish spirit all at the surface. \u201CHow\r\nI should like to run away from horrid London altogether, and never hear\r\nof it again!--Dear old Lossie House! and the boats! and the fishermen!\u201D\r\nshe added meditatively.\r\n\r\nThe anchor was already up, and the yacht drifting with the falling\r\ntide. A moment more and she spread a low treble-reefed main-sail\r\nbehind, a little jib before, and the western breeze filled and swelled\r\nand made them alive, and with wind and tide she went swiftly down the\r\nsmooth stream. Florimel clapped her hands with delight. The shores and\r\nall their houses fled up the river. They slid past row-boats, and great\r\nheavy barges loaded to the lip, with huge red sails and yellow, glowing\r\nand gleaming in the hot sun. For one moment the shadow of Vauxhall\r\nBridge gloomed like a death-cloud, chill and cavernous, over their\r\nheads; then out again they shot into the lovely light and heat of the\r\nsummer world.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s well we ain\u2019t got to shoot Putney or Battersea,\u201D said Travers\r\nwith a grim smile, as he stood shaping her course by inches with his\r\nmagic-like steering, in the midst of a little covey of pleasure-boats:\r\n\u201Cwith this wind we might ha\u2019 brought either on \u2019em about our ears like\r\nan old barn.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThis _is_ life!\u201D cried Florimel, as the river bore them nearer and\r\nnearer to the vortex--deeper and deeper into the tumult of London.\r\n\r\nHow solemn the silent yet never resting highway!--almost majestic\r\nin the stillness of its hurrying might as it rolled heedless past\r\nhouses and wharfs that crowded its brinks. They darted through under\r\nWestminster Bridge, and boats and barges more and more numerous covered\r\nthe stream. Waterloo Bridge, Blackfriars\u2019 Bridge they passed. Sunlight\r\nall, and flashing water, and gleaming oars, and gay boats, and endless\r\nmotion! out of which rose calm, solemn, reposeful, the resting yet\r\nhovering dome of St Paul\u2019s, with its satellite spires, glittering in\r\nthe tremulous hot air that swathed in multitudinous ripples the mighty\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nSouthwark Bridge--and only London Bridge lay between them and the open\r\nriver, still widening as it flowed to the aged ocean. Through the\r\ncentre arch they shot, and lo! a world of masts, waiting to woo with\r\nwhite sails the winds that should bear them across deserts of water to\r\nlands of wealth and mystery. Through the labyrinth led the highway of\r\nthe stream, and downward they still swept--past the Tower, and past the\r\nwharf where that morning Malcolm had said good-bye for a time to his\r\nfour-footed subject and friend. The smack\u2019s place was empty. With her\r\nhugest of sails, she was tearing and flashing away, out of their sight,\r\nfar down the river before them.\r\n\r\nThrough dingy dreary Limehouse they sank, and coasted the melancholy,\r\nhouseless Isle of Dogs; but on all sides were ships and ships, and when\r\nthey thinned at last, Greenwich rose before them. London and the parks\r\nlooked unendurable from this more varied life, more plentiful air,\r\nand above all more abundant space. The very spirit of freedom seemed\r\nto wave his wings about the yacht, fanning full her sails. Florimel\r\nbreathed as if she never could have enough of the sweet wind; each\r\nbreath gave her all the boundless region whence it blew; she gazed\r\nas if she would fill her soul with the sparkling gray of the water,\r\nthe sun-melted blue of the sky, and the incredible green of the flat\r\nshores. For minutes she would be silent, her parted lips revealing\r\nher absorbed delight, then break out in a volley of questions, now\r\naddressing Malcolm, now Travers. She tried Davy too, but Davy knew\r\nnothing except his duty here. The Thames was like an unknown eternity\r\nto the creature of the Wan Water-- about which, however, he could have\r\ntold her a thousand things. Down and down the river they flew, and not\r\nuntil miles and miles of meadows had come between her and London, not\r\nindeed until Gravesend appeared, did it occur to Florimel that perhaps\r\nit might be well to think by-and-by of returning. But she trusted\r\neverything to Malcolm, who of course would see that everything was as\r\nit ought to be.\r\n\r\nHer excitement began to flag a little. She was getting tired. The\r\nbottle had been strained by the ferment of the wine. She turned to\r\nMalcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CHad we not better be putting about?\u201D she said. \u201CI should like to go\r\non for ever--but we must come another day, better provided. We shall\r\nhardly be in time for lunch.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was nearly four o\u2019clock, but she rarely looked at her watch, and\r\nindeed wound it up only now and then.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you go below and have some lunch, my lady?\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere can\u2019t be anything on board!\u201D she answered.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome and see, my lady,\u201D rejoined Malcolm, and led the way to the\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw the little cabin, she gave a cry of delight.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, it is just like our own cabin in the Psyche,\u201D she said, \u201Conly\r\nsmaller! Is it not, Malcolm?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is smaller, my lady,\u201D returned Malcolm, \u201Cbut then there is a little\r\nstate-room beyond.\u201D\r\n\r\nOn the table was a nice meal--cold, but not the less agreeable in the\r\nsummer weather. Everything looked charming. There were flowers; the\r\nlinen was snowy; and the bread was the very sort Florimel liked best.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is a perfect fairy-tale!\u201D she cried. \u201CAnd I declare here is our\r\ncrest on the forks and spoons!--What does it all mean, Malcolm?\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Malcolm had slipped away, and gone on deck again, leaving her to\r\nfood and conjecture, while he brought Rose up from the fore-cabin for a\r\nlittle air. Finding her fast asleep, however, he left her undisturbed.\r\n\r\nFlorimel finished her meal, and set about examining the cabin more\r\nclosely. The result was bewilderment. How could a yacht, fitted with\r\nsuch completeness, such luxury, be lying for hire in the Thames? As for\r\nthe crest on the plate, that was a curious coincidence: many people had\r\nthe same crest. But both materials and colours were like those of the\r\nPysche! Then the pretty bindings on the book-shelves attracted her:\r\nevery book was either one she knew or one of which Malcolm had spoken\r\nto her! He must have had a hand in the business! Next she opened the\r\ndoor of the state-room; but when she saw the lovely little white berth,\r\nand the indications of every comfort belonging to a lady\u2019s chamber,\r\nshe could keep her pleasure to herself no longer. She hastened to the\r\ncompanion-way, and called Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat does it all mean?\u201D she said, her eyes and cheeks glowing with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt means, my lady, that you are on board your own yacht, the Pysche.\r\nI brought her with me from Portlossie, and have had her fitted up\r\naccording to the wish you once expressed to my lord, your father, that\r\nyou could sleep on board. Now you might make a voyage of many days in\r\nher.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Malcolm!\u201D was all Florimel could answer. She was too pleased to\r\nthink as yet of any of the thousand questions that might naturally have\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, you\u2019ve got the Arabian Nights, and all my favourite books there!\u201D\r\nshe said at length.--\u201CHow long shall we have before we get among the\r\nships again?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe fancied she had given orders to return, and that the boat had been\r\nput about.\r\n\r\n\u201CA good many hours, my lady,\u201D answered Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, of course!\u201D she returned; \u201Cit takes much longer against wind and\r\ntide.--But my time is my own,\u201D she added, rather in the manner of one\r\nasserting a freedom she did not feel, \u201Cand I don\u2019t see why I should\r\ntrouble myself. It will make some to-do, I daresay, if I don\u2019t appear\r\nat dinner; but it won\u2019t do anybody any harm. They wouldn\u2019t break their\r\nhearts if they never saw me again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot one of them, my lady,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\nShe lifted her head sharply, but took no farther notice of his remark.\r\n\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t be plagued any more,\u201D she said, holding counsel with herself,\r\nbut intending Malcolm to hear. \u201CI will break with them rather. Why\r\nshould I not be as free as Clementina? She comes and goes when and\r\nwhere she likes, and does what she pleases.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, indeed?\u201D said Malcolm; and a pause followed, during which\r\nFlorimel stood apparently thinking, but in reality growing sleepy.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will lie down a little,\u201D she said, \u201Cwith one of those lovely books.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe excitement, the air, and the pleasure generally had wearied her.\r\nNothing could have suited Malcolm better. He left her. She went to her\r\nberth, and fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke, it was some time before she could think where she was.\r\nA strange ghostly light was about her, in which she could see nothing\r\nplain; but the motion helped her to understand. She rose, and crept\r\nto the companion ladder, and up on deck. Wonder upon wonder! A clear\r\nfull moon reigned high in the heavens, and below there was nothing\r\nbut water, gleaming with her molten face, or rushing past the boat\r\nlead-coloured, gray, and white. Here and there a vessel --a snow-cloud\r\nof sails--would glide between them and the moon, and turn black from\r\ntruck to water-line. The mast of the Psyche had shot up to its full\r\nheight; the reef-points of the main-sail were loose, and the gaff was\r\ncrowned with its topsail; foresail and jib were full; and she was\r\nflying as if her soul thirsted within her after infinite spaces. Yet\r\nwhat more could she want? All around her was wave rushing upon wave,\r\nand above her blue heaven and regnant moon. Florimel gave a great sigh\r\nof delight.\r\n\r\nBut what did it--what could it mean? What was Malcolm about? Where was\r\nhe taking her? What would London say to such an escapade extraordinary?\r\nLady Bellair would be the first to believe she had run away with her\r\ngroom--she knew so many instances of that sort of thing! and Lord\r\nLiftore would be the next. It was too bad of Malcolm! But she did not\r\nfeel very angry with him, notwithstanding, for had he not done it to\r\ngive her pleasure? And assuredly he had not failed. He knew better than\r\nanyone how to please her--better even than Lenorme.\r\n\r\nShe looked around her. No one was to be seen but Davie, who was\r\nsteering. The main-sail hid the men, and Rose, having been on deck for\r\ntwo or three hours, was again below. She turned to Davy. But the boy\r\nhad been schooled, and only answered,\r\n\r\n\u201CI maunna say naething sae lang \u2019s I\u2019m steerin\u2019, mem.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe called Malcolm. He was beside her ere his name had left her lips.\r\nThe boy\u2019s reply had irritated her, and, coming upon this sudden and\r\nutter change in her circumstances, made her feel as one no longer lady\r\nof herself and her people, but a prisoner.\r\n\r\n\u201COnce more, what does this mean, Malcolm?\u201D she said, in high\r\ndispleasure. \u201CYou have deceived me shamefully! You left me to believe\r\nwe were on our way back to London--and here we are out at sea! Am I no\r\nlonger your mistress? Am I a child, to be taken where you please?--And\r\nwhat, pray, is to become of the horses you left at Mr Lenorme\u2019s?\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm was glad of a question he was prepared to answer.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey are in their own stalls by this time, my lady. I took care of\r\nthat.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen it was all a trick to carry me off against my will!\u201D she cried,\r\nwith growing indignation.\r\n\r\n\u201CHardly against your will, my lady,\u201D said Malcolm, embarrassed and\r\nthoughtful, in a tone deprecating and apologetic.\r\n\r\n\u201CUtterly against my will!\u201D insisted Florimel. \u201CCould I ever have\r\nconsented to go to sea with a boatful of men, and not a woman on board?\r\nYou have disgraced me, Malcolm.\u201D\r\n\r\nBetween anger and annoyance she was on the point of crying.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s not so bad as that, my lady.--Here, Rose!\u201D\r\n\r\nAt his word, Rose appeared.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve brought one of Lady Bellair\u2019s maids for your service, my lady,\u201D\r\nMalcolm went on. \u201CShe will do the best she can to wait on you.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel gave her a look.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t remember you,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, my lady. I was in the kitchen.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen you can\u2019t be of much use to me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA willing heart goes a long way, my lady,\u201D said Rose, prettily.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is fine,\u201D returned Florimel, rather pleased. \u201CCan you get me some\r\ntea?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel turned, and, much to Malcolm\u2019s content vouchsafing him not a\r\nword more, went below.\r\n\r\nPresently a little silver lamp appeared in the roof of the cabin, and\r\nin a few minutes Davy came, carrying the tea-tray, and followed by Rose\r\nwith the teapot. As soon as they were alone, Florimel began to question\r\nRose; but the girl soon satisfied her that she knew little or nothing.\r\nWhen Florimel pressed her how she could go she knew not where at the\r\ndesire of a fellow-servant, she gave such confused and apparently\r\ncontradictory answers, that Florimel began to think ill of both her and\r\nMalcolm, and to feel more uncomfortable and indignant; and the more she\r\ndwelt upon Malcolm\u2019s presumption, and speculated as to his possible\r\ndesign in it, she grew the angrier.\r\n\r\nShe went again on deck. By this time she was in a passion--little\r\nmollified by the sense of her helplessness.\r\n\r\n\u201CMacPhail,\u201D she said, laying the restraint of dignified utterance\r\nupon her words, \u201CI desire you to give me a good reason for your most\r\nunaccountable behaviour. Where are you taking me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTo Lossie House, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed!\u201D she returned with scornful and contemptuous surprise. \u201CThen I\r\norder you to change your course at once and return to London.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C_Cannot!_ Whose orders but mine are you under, pray?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYour father\u2019s, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have heard more than enough of that unfortunate--statement, and the\r\nmeasureless assumptions founded on it. I shall heed it no longer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am only doing my best to take care of you, my lady, as I promised\r\n_him_. You will know it one day if you will but trust me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have trusted you ten times too much, and have gained nothing in\r\nreturn but reasons for repenting it. Like all other servants made too\r\nmuch of you have grown insolent. But I shall put a stop to it. I cannot\r\npossibly keep you in my service after this. Am I to pay a master where\r\nI want a servant?\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm was silent.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must have some reason for this strange conduct,\u201D she went on. \u201CHow\r\ncan your supposed duty to my father justify you in treating me with\r\nsuch disrespect. Let me know your reasons. I have a right to know them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will answer you, my lady,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201C--Davy, go forward; I will\r\ntake the helm.--Now, my lady, if you will sit on that cushion.--Rose,\r\nbring my lady a fur-cloak you will find in the cabin.--Now, my lady, if\r\nyou will speak low that neither Davy nor Rose shall hear us--Travers is\r\ndeaf--I will answer you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI ask you,\u201D said Florimel, \u201Cwhy you have dared to bring me away like\r\nthis. Nothing but some danger threatening me could justify it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere you say it, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what is the danger, pray?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou were going on the continent with Lady Bellair and Lord Liftore\r\n--and without me to do as I had promised.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou insult me!\u201D cried Florimel. \u201CAre my movements to be subject to\r\nthe approbation of my groom? Is it possible my father could give his\r\nhenchman such authority over his daughter? I ask you again, where was\r\nthe danger?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIn your company, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSo!\u201D exclaimed Florimel, attempting to rise in sarcasm as she rose in\r\nwrath, lest she should fall into undignified rage. \u201CAnd what may be\r\nyour objection to my companions?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat Lady Bellair is not respected in any circle where her history is\r\nknown; and that her nephew is a scoundrel.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt but adds to the wrong you heap on me, that you compel me to hear\r\nsuch wicked abuse of my father\u2019s friends,\u201D said Florimel, struggling\r\nwith tears of anger. But for regard to her dignity she would have\r\nbroken out in fierce and voluble rage.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf your father knew Lord Liftore as I do, he would be the last man my\r\nlord marquis would see in your company.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause he gave you a beating, you have no right to slander him,\u201D said\r\nFlorimel spitefully.\r\n\r\nMalcolm laughed. He must either laugh or be angry.\r\n\r\n\u201CMay I ask how your ladyship came to hear of that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe told me himself,\u201D she answered.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen, my lady, he is a liar, as well as worse. It was I who gave _him_\r\nthe drubbing he deserved for his insolence to my--mistress. I am sorry\r\nto mention the disagreeable fact, but it is absolutely necessary you\r\nshould know what sort of man he is.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd, if there be a lie, which of the two is more likely to tell it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat question is for you, my lady, to answer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI never knew a servant who would not tell a lie,\u201D said Florimel.\r\n\r\n\u201CI was brought up a fisherman,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd,\u201D Florimel went on, \u201CI have heard my father say no gentleman ever\r\ntold a lie.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen Lord Liftore is no gentleman,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CBut I am not going\r\nto plead my own cause even to you, my lady. If you can doubt me, do.\r\nI have only one thing more to say:--that when I told you and my Lady\r\nClementina about the fisher-girl and the gentleman----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow dare you refer to that again? Even you ought to know there are\r\nthings a lady cannot hear. It is enough you affronted me with that\r\nbefore Lady Clementina--and after foolish boasts on my part of your\r\ngood breeding! Now you bring it up again, when I cannot escape your low\r\ntalk!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady, I am sorrier than you think; but which is worse--that you\r\nshould hear such a thing spoken of, or make a friend of the man who did\r\nit--and that is Lord Liftore?\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel turned away, and gave her seeming attention to the moonlit\r\nwaters, sweeping past the swift-sailing cutter. Malcolm\u2019s heart ached\r\nfor her: he thought she was deeply troubled. But she was not half so\r\nshocked as he imagined. Infinitely worse would have been the shock\r\nto him could he have seen how little the charge against Liftore had\r\ntouched her. Alas! evil communications had already in no small degree\r\ncorrupted her good manners. Lady Bellair had uttered no bad words in\r\nher hearing: had softened to decency every story that required it;\r\nhad not unfrequently tacked a worldly-wise moral to the end of one;\r\nand yet, and yet, such had been the tone of her telling, such the\r\nallotment of laughter and lamentation, such the acceptance of things as\r\nnecessary, and such the repudiation of things as Quixotic, puritanical,\r\nimpossible, that the girl\u2019s natural notions of the lovely and the clean\r\nhad got dismally shaken and confused. Happily it was as yet more her\r\njudgment than her heart that was perverted. But had she spoken out\r\nwhat was in her thoughts as she looked over the great wallowing water,\r\nshe would have merely said that for all that Liftore was no worse\r\nthan other men. They were all the same. It was very unpleasant; but\r\nhow could a lady help it? If men would behave so, were by nature like\r\nthat, women must not make themselves miserable about it. They need ask\r\nno questions. They were not supposed to be acquainted with the least\r\nfragment of the facts, and they must cleave to their ignorance, and\r\nlay what blame there might be on the women concerned. The thing was\r\ntoo indecent even to think about. Ostrich-like they must hide their\r\nheads--close their eyes and take the vice in their arms--to love,\r\nhonour, and obey, as if it were virtue\u2019s self, and men as pure as their\r\ndemands on their wives.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands that virtually reason thus: Only ignore the thing\r\neffectually, and for you it is not. Lie right thoroughly to yourself,\r\nand the thing is gone. The lie destroys the fact. So reasoned Lady\r\nMacbeth--until conscience at last awoke, and she could no longer keep\r\neven the smell of the blood from her. What need Lady Lossie care about\r\nthe fisher-girl, or any other concerned with his past, so long as he\r\nbehaved like a gentleman to her! Malcolm was a foolish meddling fellow,\r\nwhose interference was the more troublesome that it was honest.\r\n\r\nShe stood thus gazing on the waters that heaved and swept astern, but\r\nwithout knowing that she saw them, her mind full of such nebulous\r\nmatter as, condensed, would have made such thoughts as I have set down.\r\nAnd still and ever the water rolled and tossed away behind in the\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, my lady!\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cwhat it would be to have a soul as big\r\nand as clean as all this!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe made no reply, did not turn her head, or acknowledge that she heard\r\nhim, a few minutes more she stood, then went below in silence, and\r\nMalcolm saw no more of her that night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nHOPE CHAPEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday, during which Malcolm lay at the point of death some\r\nthree stories above his sister\u2019s room. There, in the morning, while\r\nhe was at the worst, she was talking with Clementina, who had called\r\nto see whether she would not go and hear the preacher of whom he had\r\nspoken with such fervour. Florimel laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou seem to take everything for gospel Malcolm says, Clementina!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly not,\u201D returned Clementina, rather annoyed. \u201CGospel\r\nnow-a-days is what nobody disputes and nobody heeds; but I do heed what\r\nMalcolm says, and intend to find out, if I _can_, whether there is any\r\nreality in it. I thought you had a high opinion of your groom!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI would take his word for anything a man\u2019s word can be taken for,\u201D\r\nsaid Florimel.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you don\u2019t set much store by his judgment?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, I daresay he\u2019s right. But I don\u2019t care for the things you like so\r\nmuch to talk with him about. He\u2019s a sort of poet, anyhow, and poets\r\nmust be absurd. They are always either dreaming or talking about their\r\ndreams. They care nothing for the realities of life. No--if you want\r\nadvice, you must go to your lawyer or clergyman, or some man of common\r\nsense, neither groom nor poet.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen, Florimel, it comes to this--that this groom of yours is one of\r\nthe truest of men, and one who possessed your father\u2019s confidence, but\r\nyou are so much his superior that you are capable of judging him, and\r\njustified in despising his judgment.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COnly in practical matters, Clementina.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd duty towards God is with you such a practical matter that you\r\ncannot listen to anything he has got to say about it.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor my part, I would give all I have to know there was a God worth\r\nbelieving in.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CClementina!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf course there is a God. It is very horrible to deny it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhich is worse--to deny _it_, or to deny _him_? Now, I confess to\r\ndoubting _it_--that is, the fact of a God; but you seem to me to deny\r\nGod himself, for you admit there is a God--think it very wicked to deny\r\nthat, and yet you don\u2019t take interest enough in him to wish to learn\r\nanything about him. You won\u2019t _think_, Florimel. I don\u2019t fancy you ever\r\nreally _think_.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel again laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am glad,\u201D she said, \u201Cthat you don\u2019t judge me _incapable_ of that\r\nhigh art. But it is not so very long since Malcolm used to hint\r\nsomething much the same about yourself, my lady!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen he was quite right,\u201D returned Clementina. \u201CI am only just\r\nbeginning to think, and if I can find a teacher, here I am, his pupil.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I suppose I can spare my groom quite enough to teach you all he\r\nknows,\u201D Florimel said, with what Clementina took for a marked absence\r\nof expression. She reddened. But she was not one to defend herself\r\nbefore her principles.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf he can, why should he not?\u201D she said. \u201CBut it was of his friend Mr\r\nGraham I was thinking---not himself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou cannot tell whether he has got anything to teach you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYour groom\u2019s testimony gives likelihood enough to make it my duty to\r\ngo and see. I intend to find the place this evening.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt must be some little ranting methodist conventicle. He would not be\r\nallowed to preach in a church, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf course not! The church of England is like the apostle that forbade\r\nthe man casting out devils, and got forbid himself for it --with this\r\ndifference, that she won\u2019t be forbid. Well, she chooses her portion\r\nwith Dives and not Lazarus. She is the most arrant respecter of persons\r\nI know, and her Christianity is worse than a farce. It was that first\r\nof all that drove me to doubt. If I could find a place where everything\r\nwas just the opposite, the poorer it was the better I should like\r\nit. It makes me feel quite wicked to hear a smug parson reading the\r\ngold ring and the goodly apparel, while the pew-openers beneath are\r\nillustrating in dumb show the very thing the apostle is pouring out\r\nthe vial of his indignation upon over their heads;--doing it calmly\r\nand without a suspicion, for the parson, while he reads, is rejoicing\r\nin his heart over the increasing aristocracy of his congregation. The\r\nfarce is fit to make a devil in torment laugh.\u201D\r\n\r\nOnce more, Florimel laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnother revolution, Clementina, and we shall have you heading the\r\ncanaille to destroy Westminster Abbey.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI would follow any leader to destroy falsehood,\u201D said Clementina. \u201CNo\r\ncanaille will take that up until it meddles with their stomachs or\r\ntheir pew-rents.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, Clementina, you are the worst Jacobin I ever heard talk. My\r\ngroom is quite an aristocrat beside you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot an atom more than I am. I do acknowledge an aristocracy-- but it\r\nis one neither of birth nor of intellect nor of wealth.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is there besides to make one?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSomething I hope to find before long. What if there be indeed a\r\nkingdom and an aristocracy of life and truth!--Will you or will you not\r\ngo with me to hear this schoolmaster?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will go anywhere with you, if it were only to be seen with such a\r\nbeauty,\u201D said Florimel, throwing her arms round her neck and kissing\r\nher.\r\n\r\nClementina gently returned the embrace, and the thing was settled.\r\n\r\nThe sound of their wheels, pausing in swift revolution with the clangor\r\nof iron hoofs on rough stones at the door of the chapel, refreshed the\r\ndiaconal heart like the sound of water in the desert. For the first\r\ntime in the memory of the oldest, the day-spring of success seemed on\r\nthe point of breaking over Hope Chapel. The ladies were ushered in by\r\nMr Marshal himself, to Clementina\u2019s disgust and Florimel\u2019s amusement,\r\nwith much the same attention as his own shop-walker would have shown\r\nto carriage-customers.--How could a man who taught light and truth be\r\nfound in such a mean _entourage_? But the setting was not the jewel.\r\nA real stone _might_ be found in a copper ring. So said Clementina to\r\nherself as she sat waiting her hoped for instructor.\r\n\r\nMrs Catanach settled her broad back into its corner, chuckling over her\r\nown wisdom and foresight. Her seat was at the pulpit end of the chapel,\r\nat right angles to almost all the rest of the pews --chosen because\r\nthence, if indeed she could not well see the preacher, she could get\r\na good glimpse of nearly everyone that entered. Keen-sighted both\r\nphysically and intellectually, she recognized Florimel the moment she\r\nsaw her.\r\n\r\n\u201CTwa doos mair to the boody-craw!\u201D she laughed to herself. \u201CAe man\r\nthrashin\u2019, an\u2019 twa birdies pickin\u2019!\u201D she went on, quoting the old\r\nnursery nonsense. Then she stooped, and let down her veil. Florimel\r\nhated her, and therefore might know her.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s the day o\u2019 the Lord wi\u2019 auld Sanny Grame!\u201D she resumed to\r\nherself, as she lifted her head. \u201CHe\u2019s stickit nae mair, but a chosen\r\ntrumpet at last! Foul fa\u2019 \u2019im for a wearifu\u2019 cratur for a\u2019 that! He\r\nhas nowther balm o\u2019 grace nor pith o\u2019 damnation. Yon laad Flemin\u2019, \u2019at\r\npreached i\u2019 the Baillies\u2019 Barn aboot the dowgs gaein\u2019 roon\u2019 an\u2019 roon\u2019\r\nthe wa\u2019s o\u2019 the New Jeroozlem, gien he had but hauden thegither an\u2019\r\nno gane to the worms sae sune, wad hae dung a score o\u2019 \u2019im. But Sanny\r\nangers me to that degree \u2019at but for rizons--like yon twa--I wad gang\r\noot i\u2019 the mids o\u2019 ane o\u2019 \u2019s palahvers, an\u2019 never come back, though I\r\nha\u2019e a haill quarter o\u2019 my sittin\u2019 to sit oot yet, an\u2019 it cost me dear,\r\nan\u2019 fits the auld back o\u2019 me no that ill.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Graham rose to read the psalm, great was Clementina\u2019s\r\ndisappointment: he looked altogether, as she thought, of a sort with\r\nthe place--mean and dreary--of the chapel very chapelly, and she\r\ndid not believe it could be the man of whom Malcolm had spoken. By\r\na strange coincidence however, a kind of occurrence as frequent as\r\nstrange, he read for his text that same passage about the gold ring and\r\nthe vile raiment, in which we learn how exactly the behaviour of the\r\nearly Jewish churches corresponded to that of the later English ones,\r\nand Clementina soon began to alter her involuntary judgment of him\r\nwhen she found herself listening to an utterance beside which her most\r\nvoluble indignation would have been but as the babble of a child.\r\n\r\nSweeping, incisive, withering, blasting denunciation, logic and poetry\r\ncombining in one torrent of genuine eloquence, poured confusion and\r\ndismay upon head and heart of all who set themselves up for pillars of\r\nthe church without practising the first principles of the doctrine of\r\nChrist--men who, professing to gather their fellows together in the\r\nname of Christ, conducted the affairs of the church on the principles\r\nof hell--men so blind and dull and slow of heart, that they would never\r\nknow what the outer darkness meant until it had closed around them--men\r\nwho paid court to the rich for their money, and to the poor for their\r\nnumbers--men who sought gain first, safety next, and the will of God\r\nnot at all --men whose presentation of Christianity was enough to drive\r\nthe world to a preferable infidelity.\r\n\r\nClementina listened with her very soul. All doubt as to whether this\r\nwas Malcolm\u2019s friend, vanished within two minutes of his commencement.\r\nIf she rejoiced a little more than was humble or healthful in\r\nfinding that such a man thought as she thought, she gained this\r\ngood notwithstanding--the presence and power of a man who believed\r\nin righteousness the doctrine he taught. Also she perceived that\r\nthe principles of equality he held, were founded on the infinite\r\npossibilities of the individual--and of the race only through the\r\nindividual; and that he held these principles with an absoluteness, an\r\nearnestness, a simplicity, that dwarfed her loudest objurgation to the\r\nuneasy murmuring of a sleeper. She could not but trust him, and her\r\nhope grew great that perhaps for her he held the key of the kingdom of\r\nheaven. She saw that if what this man said was true, then the gospel\r\nwas represented by men who knew nothing of its real nature, and by such\r\nshe had been led into a false judgment of it.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf such a man,\u201D said the schoolmaster in conclusion, \u201Cwould but once\r\nrepresent to himself that the man whom he regards as beneath him, _may_\r\nnevertheless be immeasurably above him--and _that_ after no arbitrary\r\njudgment, but according to the absolute facts of creation, the scale\r\nof the kingdom of God, in which _being_ is rank; if he could persuade\r\nhimself of the possibility that he may yet have to worship before the\r\nfeet of those on whom he looks down as on the creatures of another and\r\nmeaner order of creation, would it not sting him to rise, and, lest\r\nthis should be one of such, make offer of his chair to the poor man in\r\nthe vile raiment? Would he ever more, all his life long, dare to say,\r\n\u2018Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool?\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\nDuring the week that followed, Clementina reflected with growing\r\ndelight on what she had heard, and looked forward to hearing more of a\r\nkind correspondent on the approaching Sunday. Nor did the shock of the\r\ndisappearance of Florimel with Malcolm abate her desire to be taught by\r\nMalcolm\u2019s friend.\r\n\r\nLady Bellair was astounded, mortified, enraged. Liftore turned grey\r\nwith passion, then livid with mortification, at the news. Not one of\r\nall their circle, as Florimel had herself foreseen, doubted for a\r\nmoment that she had run away with that groom of hers. Indeed, upon\r\nexamination, it became evident that the scheme had been for some time\r\nin hand: the yacht they had gone on board had been lying there for\r\nmonths; and although she was her own mistress, and might marry whom she\r\npleased, it was no wonder she had run away, for how could she have held\r\nher face to it, or up after it?\r\n\r\nLady Clementina accepted the general conclusion, but judged it\r\nindividually. She had more reason to be distressed at what seemed to\r\nhave taken place than anyone else; indeed it stung her to the heart,\r\nwounding her worse than in its first stunning effects she was able to\r\nknow; yet she thought better rather than worse of Florimel because\r\nof it. What she did not like in her with reference to the affair was\r\nthe depreciatory manner in which she had always spoken of Malcolm. If\r\ngenuine, it was quite inconsistent with due regard for the man for\r\nwhom she was yet prepared to sacrifice so much; if, on the other hand,\r\nher slight opinion of his judgment was a pretence, then she had been\r\ndisloyal to the just prerogatives of friendship.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of that week was the sorest time Clementina had ever\r\npassed. But, like a true woman, she fought her own misery and sense\r\nof loss, as well as her annoyance and anxiety,--constantly saying to\r\nherself that, be the thing as it might, she could never cease to be\r\nglad that she had known Malcolm MacPhail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nA NEW PUPIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sermon Lady Clementina heard with such delight had followed one\r\nlevelled at the common and right worldly idea of success harboured\r\nby each, and unquestioned by one of the chief men of the community:\r\ntogether they caused a strange uncertain sense of discomfort in the\r\nmind diaconal. Slow to perceive that that idea, nauseous in his\r\npresentment of it, was the very same cherished and justified by\r\nthemselves; unwilling also to believe that in his denunciation of\r\nrespecters of persons they themselves had a full share, they yet felt\r\na little uneasy from the vague whispers of their consciences on the\r\nside of the neglected principles enounced, clashing with the less vague\r\nconviction that if those whispers were encouraged and listened to, the\r\nruin of their hopes for their chapel, and their influence in connection\r\nwith it, must follow. They eyed each other doubtfully, and there\r\nappeared a general tendency amongst them to close-pressed lips and\r\nsingle shakes of the head. But there were other forces at work--tending\r\nin the same direction.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the influence of the schoolmaster upon the\r\ncongregation gathered in Hope Chapel, there was one on whom his\r\nconverse, supplemented by his preaching, had taken genuine hold.\r\nFrederick Marshal had begun to open his eyes to the fact that, regarded\r\nas a profession, the ministry, as they called it in their communion,\r\nwas the meanest way of making a living in the whole creation, one\r\ndeserving the contempt of every man honest enough to give honourable\r\nwork, that is, work worth the money, for the money paid him. Also he\r\nhad a glimmering insight, on the other hand, into the truth of what the\r\ndominie said--that it was the noblest of martyrdoms to the man who,\r\nsent by God, loved the truth with his whole soul, and was never happier\r\nthan when bearing witness of it, except, indeed, in those blessed\r\nmoments when receiving it of the Father. In consequence of this opening\r\nof his eyes the youth recoiled with dismay from the sacrilegious\r\nmockery of which he had been guilty in meditating the presumption of\r\nteaching holy things of which the sole sign that he knew anything was\r\nnow afforded by this same recoil. At last he was not far from the\r\nkingdom of heaven, though whether he was to be sent to persuade men\r\nthat that kingdom was amongst them, and must be in them, remained a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the latter of those two sermons, Frederick, as\r\nthey sat at breakfast, succeeded, with no small effort, for he feared\r\nhis mother, in blurting out to his father the request that he might be\r\ntaken into the counting house; and when indignantly requested, over\r\nthe top of the teapot, to explain himself, declared that he found it\r\nimpossible to give his mind to a course of education which could only\r\nend in the disappointment of his parents, seeing he was at length\r\nsatisfied that he had no call to the ministry. His father was not\r\ndispleased at the thought of having him at the shop; but his mother\r\nwas for some moments speechless with angry tribulation. Recovering\r\nherself, with scornful bitterness she requested to know to what tempter\r\nhe had been giving ear--for tempted he must have been ere son of hers\r\nwould have been guilty of backsliding from _the cause_, of taking his\r\nhand from the plough and looking behind him. The youth returned such\r\nanswers as, while they satisfied his father he was right, served only\r\nto convince his mother, where yet conviction was hardly needed, that\r\nshe had to thank the dominie for his defection, his apostasy from the\r\nchurch to the world.\r\n\r\nIncapable of perceiving that now first there was hope of a genuine\r\ndisciple in the child of her affection, she was filled with the gall\r\nof disappointment, and with spite against the man who had taught her\r\nson how worse than foolish it is to aspire to teach before one has\r\nlearned; nor did she fail to cast scathing reflections on her husband,\r\nin that he had brought home a viper in his bosom, a wolf into his\r\nfold, the wretched minion of a worldly church to lead her son away\r\ncaptive at his will; and partly no doubt from his last uncomfortable\r\nsermons, but mainly from the play of Mrs Marshal\u2019s tongue on her\r\nhusband\u2019s tympanum, the deacons in full conclave agreed that no further\r\nrenewal of the invitation to preach \u201Cfor them\u201D should be made to the\r\nschoolmaster--just the end of the business Mr Graham had expected, and\r\nfor which he had provided. On Tuesday morning he smiled to himself, and\r\nwondered whether, if he were to preach in his own schoolroom the next\r\nSunday evening, anyone would come to hear him. On Saturday he received\r\na cool letter of thanks for his services, written by the ironmonger in\r\nthe name of the deacons, enclosing a cheque, tolerably liberal as ideas\r\nwent, in acknowledgment of them. The cheque Mr Graham returned, saying\r\nthat, as he was not a preacher by profession, he had no right to take\r\nfees. It was a half-holiday: he walked up to Hampstead Heath, and was\r\npaid for everything, in sky and cloud, fresh air, and a glorious sunset.\r\n\r\nWhen the end of her troubled week came, and the Sunday of her\r\nexpectation brought lovely weather, with a certain vague suspicion of\r\npeace, into the regions of Mayfair and Spitalfields, Clementina walked\r\nacross the Regent\u2019s Park to Hope Chapel, and its morning observances;\r\nbut thought herself poorly repaid for her exertions by having to listen\r\nto a dreadful sermon and worse prayers from Mr Masquar--one of the\r\nchief priests of Commonplace--a comfortable idol to serve, seeing he\r\naccepts as homage to himself all that any man offers to his own person,\r\nopinions, or history. But Clementina contrived to endure it, comforting\r\nherself that she had made a mistake in supposing Mr Graham preached in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nIn the evening her carriage once again drew up with clang and clatter\r\nat the door of the chapel. But her coachman was out of temper at having\r\nto leave the bosom of his family circle--as he styled the table that\r\nupheld his pot of beer and jar of tobacco--of a Sunday, and sought\r\nrelief to his feelings in giving his horses a lesson in crawling; the\r\nresult of which was fortunate for his mistress: when she entered, the\r\nobnoxious Mr Masquar was already reading the hymn. She turned at once\r\nand made for the door.\r\n\r\nBut her carriage was already gone. A strange sense of loneliness and\r\ndesolation seized her. The place had grown hateful to her, and she\r\nwould have fled from it. Yet she lingered in the porch. The eyes\r\nof the man in the pulpit, with his face of false solemnity and low\r\nimportance--she seemed to feel the look of them on her back, yet she\r\nlingered. Now that Malcolm was gone, how was she to learn when Mr\r\nGraham would be preaching?\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you please, ma\u2019am,\u201D said a humble and dejected voice.\r\n\r\nShe turned and saw the seamed and smoky face of the pew-opener, who\r\nhad been watching her from the lobby, and had crept out after her. She\r\ndropped a courtesy, and went on hurriedly, with an anxious look now and\r\nthen over her shoulder--\r\n\r\n\u201COh, ma\u2019am! we shan\u2019t see _him_ no more. Our people here--they\u2019re very\r\ngood people, but they don\u2019t like to be told the truth. It seems to me\r\nas if they knowed it so well they thought as how there was no need for\r\nthem to mind it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t mean that Mr Graham has given up preaching here?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey\u2019ve given up astin\u2019 of \u2019im to preach, lady. But if ever there was\r\na good man in that pulpit, Mr Graham he do be that man!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know where he lives?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, ma\u2019am; but it would be hard to direct you.\u201D Here she looked in\r\nat the door of the chapel with a curious half-frightened glance, as if\r\nto satisfy herself that the inner door was closed. \u201CBut,\u201D she went on,\r\n\u201Cthey won\u2019t miss me now the service is begun, and I can be back before\r\nit\u2019s over. I\u2019ll show you where, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI should be greatly obliged to you,\u201D said Clementina, \u201Conly I am sorry\r\nto give you the trouble.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTo tell the truth, I\u2019m only too glad to get away,\u201D she returned, \u201Cfor\r\nthe place it do look like a cementery, now _he\u2019s_ out of it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWas he so kind to you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe never spoke word to me, as to myself like, no, nor never gave me\r\nsixpence, like Mr Masquar do; but he give me strength in my heart to\r\nbear up, and that\u2019s better than meat or money.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was a good half-hour\u2019s walk, and during it Clementina held what\r\nconversation she might with her companion. It was not much the woman\r\nhad to say of a general sort. She knew little beyond her own troubles\r\nand the help that met them, but what else are the two main forces whose\r\ncomposition results in upward motion? Her world was very limited--the\r\nhouses in which she went charing, the chapel she swept and dusted, the\r\nneighbours with whom she gossipped, the little shops where she bought\r\nthe barest needs of her bare life; but it was at least large enough to\r\nleave behind her; and if she was not one to take the kingdom of heaven\r\nby force, she was yet one to creep quietly into it. The earthly life of\r\nsuch as she-- immeasurably less sordid than that of the poet who will\r\nnot work for his daily bread, or that of the speculator who, having\r\nsettled money on his wife, risks that of his neighbour--passing away\r\nlike a cloud, will hang in their west, stained indeed, but with gold,\r\nblotted, but with roses. Dull as it all was now, Clementina yet gained\r\nfrom her unfoldings a new out-look upon life, its needs, its sorrows,\r\nits consolations, and its hopes; nor was there any vulgar pity in the\r\nsmile of the one, or of degrading acknowledgment in the tears of the\r\nother, when a piece of gold passed from hand to hand, as they parted.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday-sealed door of the stationer\u2019s shop--for there was no\r\nprivate entrance to the house--was opened by another sad-faced woman.\r\nWhat a place to seek the secret of life in! Lovelily enfolds the husk\r\nits kernel; but what the human eye turns from as squalid and unclean\r\nmay enfold the seed that clasps, couched in infinite withdrawment, the\r\nvital germ of all that is lovely and graceful, harmonious and strong,\r\nall without which no poet would sing, no martyr burn, no king rule in\r\nrighteousness, no geometrician pore over the marvellous _must_.\r\n\r\nThe woman led her through the counter into a little dingy room behind\r\nthe shop, looking out on a yard a few feet square, with a water-butt,\r\nhalf-a-dozen flower-pots, and a maimed plaster Cupid perched on the\r\nwindow-sill. There sat the schoolmaster, in conversation with a lady,\r\nwhom the woman of the house, awed by her sternness and grandeur, had,\r\nout of regard to her lodger\u2019s feelings, shown into her parlour and not\r\ninto his bedroom.\r\n\r\nCherishing the hope that the patent consequences of his line of action\r\nmight have already taught him moderation, Mrs Marshal, instead of\r\ngoing to chapel to hear Mr Masquar, had paid Mr Graham a visit, with\r\nthe object of enlisting his sympathies if she could, at all events his\r\nservices, in the combating of the scruples he had himself aroused in\r\nthe bosom of her son. What had passed between them I do not care to\r\nrecord, but when Lady Clementina--unannounced of the landlady--entered,\r\nthere was light enough, notwithstanding the non-reflective properties\r\nof the water-butt, to reveal Mrs Marshal flushed and flashing, Mr\r\nGraham grave and luminous, and to enable the chapel-business-eye of\r\nMrs Marshal, which saw every stranger that entered \u201CHope,\u201D at once to\r\nrecognise her as having made one of the congregation the last Sunday\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nEvidently one of Mr Graham\u2019s party, she was not prejudiced in her\r\nfavour. But there was that in her manner which impressed her-- that\r\nsomething ethereal and indescribable which she herself was constantly\r\naping, and, almost involuntarily, she took upon herself such honours\r\nas the place, despicable in her eyes, would admit of. She rose, made a\r\nsweeping courtesy, and addressed Lady Clementina with such a manner as\r\npeople of Mrs Marshal\u2019s ambitions put off and on like their clothes.\r\n\r\n\u201CPray, take a seat, ma\u2019am, such as it is,\u201D she said, with a wave of her\r\nhand. \u201CI believe I have had the pleasure of seeing you at our place.\u201D\r\n\r\nLady Clementina sat down: the room was too small to stand in, and Mrs\r\nMarshal seemed to take the half of it.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am not aware of the honour,\u201D she returned, doubtful what the woman\r\nmeant--perhaps some shop or dress-maker\u2019s. Clementina was not one who\r\ndelighted in freezing her humbler fellow-creatures, as we know; but\r\nthere was something altogether repulsive in the would-be-grand but\r\nreally arrogant behaviour of her fellow-visitor.\r\n\r\n\u201CI mean,\u201D said Mrs Marshal, a little abashed, for ambition is not\r\nstrength, \u201Cat our little Bethel in Kentish Town! Not that _we_ live\r\nthere!\u201D she explained with a superior smile.\r\n\r\n\u201COh! I think I understand. You must mean the chapel where this\r\ngentleman was preaching.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat _is_ my meaning,\u201D assented Mrs Marshal.\r\n\r\n\u201CI went there to-night,\u201D said Clementina, turning with some timidity\r\nto Mr Graham. \u201CThat I did not find you there, sir, will, I hope,\r\nexplain----\u201D Here she paused, and turned again to Mrs Marshal. \u201CI see\r\nyou think with me, ma\u2019am, that a true teacher is worth following.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs she said this she turned once more to Mr Graham, who sat listening\r\nwith a queer, amused, but right courteous smile.\r\n\r\n\u201CI hope you will pardon me,\u201D she continued, \u201Cfor venturing to call upon\r\nyou, and, as I have the misfortune to find you occupied, allow me to\r\ncall another day. If you would set me a time, I should be more obliged\r\nthan I can tell you,\u201D she concluded, her voice trembling a little.\r\n\r\n\u201CStay now, if you will, madam,\u201D returned the schoolmaster, with a bow\r\nof oldest-fashioned courtesy. \u201CThis lady has done laying her commands\r\nupon me, I believe.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAs you think proper to call them commands, Mr Graham, I conclude you\r\nintend to obey them,\u201D said Mrs Marshal, with a forced smile and an\r\nattempt at pleasantry.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot for the world, madam,\u201D he answered. \u201CYour son is acting the part\r\nof a gentleman--yes, I make bold to say, of one who is very nigh the\r\nkingdom of heaven, if not indeed within its gate, and before I would\r\ncheck him I would be burnt at the stake--even were your displeasure the\r\nfire, madam,\u201D he added, with a kindly bow. \u201CYour son is a line fellow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe would be, if he were left to himself. Good evening, Mr Graham.\r\nGood-bye, rather, for I _think_ we are not likely to meet again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIn heaven, I hope, madam; for by that time we shall be able to\r\nunderstand each other,\u201D said the schoolmaster, still kindly.\r\n\r\nMrs Marshal made no answer beyond a facial flash as she turned to\r\nClementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood evening, ma\u2019am,\u201D she said. \u201CTo pay court to the earthen vessel\r\nbecause of the treasure it may happen to hold, is to be a respecter of\r\npersons as bad as any.\u201D\r\n\r\nAn answering flash broke from Clementina\u2019s blue orbs, but her speech\r\nwas more than calm as she returned,\r\n\r\n\u201CI learned something of that lesson last Sunday evening, I hope,\r\nma\u2019am. But you have left me far behind, for you seem to have learned\r\ndisrespect even to the worthiest of persons. Good evening, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe looked the angry matron full in the face, with an icy regard, from\r\nwhich, as from the Gorgon eye, she fled.\r\n\r\nThe victor turned to the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n\u201CI beg your pardon, sir,\u201D she said, \u201Cfor presuming to take your part,\r\nbut a gentleman is helpless with a vulgar woman.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI thank you, madam. I hope the sharpness of your rebuke----but indeed\r\nthe poor woman can hardly help her rudeness, for she is very worldly,\r\nand believes herself very pious. It is the old story-- hard for the\r\nrich.\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina was struck.\r\n\r\n\u201CI too am rich and worldly,\u201D she said. \u201CBut I know that I am not pious,\r\nand if you would but satisfy me that religion is common sense, I would\r\ntry to be religious with all my heart and soul.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI willingly undertake the task. But let us know each other a little\r\nfirst. And lest I should afterwards seem to have taken an advantage\r\nof you, I hope you have no wish to be nameless to me, for my friend\r\nMalcolm MacPhail had so described you that I recognized your ladyship\r\nat once.\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina said that, on the contrary, she had given her name to the\r\nwoman who opened the door.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is because of what Malcolm said of you that I ventured to come to\r\nyou,\u201D she added.\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you seen Malcolm lately?\u201D he asked, his brow clouding a little.\r\n\u201CIt is more than a week since he has been to me.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon, with embarrassment, such as she would never have felt except\r\nin the presence of pure simplicity, she told of his disappearance with\r\nhis mistress.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you think they have run away together?\u201D said the schoolmaster, his\r\nface beaming with what, to Clementina\u2019s surprise, looked almost like\r\nmerriment.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I think so,\u201D she answered. \u201CWhy not, if they choose?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will say this for my friend Malcolm,\u201D returned Mr Graham composedly,\r\n\u201Cthat whatever he did I should expect to find not only all right in\r\nintention, but prudent and well-devised also. The present may well seem\r\na rash, ill-considered affair for both of them, but----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI see no necessity either for explanation or excuse,\u201D said Clementina,\r\ntoo eager to mark that she interrupted Mr Graham. \u201CIn making up her\r\nmind to marry him, Lady Lossie has shown greater wisdom and courage\r\nthan, I confess, I had given her credit for.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd Malcolm?\u201D rejoined the schoolmaster softly. \u201CShould you say of him\r\nthat he showed equal wisdom?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI decline to give an opinion upon the gentleman\u2019s part in the\r\nbusiness,\u201D answered Clementina, laughing, but glad there was so little\r\nlight in the room, for she was painfully conscious of the burning of\r\nher cheeks. \u201CBesides, I have no measure to apply to Malcolm,\u201D she went\r\non, a little hurriedly. \u201CHe is like no one else I have ever talked\r\nwith, and I confess there is something about him I cannot understand.\r\nIndeed, he is beyond me altogether.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps, having known him from infancy, I might be able to explain\r\nhim,\u201D returned Mr Graham, in a tone that invited questioning.\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps, then,\u201D said Clementina, \u201CI may be permitted, in jealousy\r\nfor the teaching I have received of him, to confess my bewilderment\r\nthat one so young should be capable of dealing with such things as he\r\ndelights in. The youth of the prophet makes me doubt his prophecy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAt least,\u201D rejoined Mr Graham, \u201Cthe phenomenon coincides with what the\r\nmaster of these things said of them--that they were revealed to babes\r\nand not to the wise and prudent. As to Malcolm\u2019s wonderful facility\r\nin giving them form and utterance, that depends so immediately on\r\nthe clear sight of them, that, granted a little of the gift poetic,\r\ndeveloped through reading and talk, we need not wonder much at it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou consider your friend a genius?\u201D suggested Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CI consider him possessed of a kind of heavenly common sense, equally\r\nat home in the truths of divine relation, and the facts of the human\r\nstruggle with nature and her forces. I should never have discovered\r\nmy own ignorance in certain points of the mathematics but for the\r\nquestions that boy put to me before he was twelve years of age. A thing\r\nnot understood lay in his mind like a fretting foreign body. But there\r\nis a far more important factor concerned than this exceptional degree\r\nof insight. Understanding is the reward of obedience. Peter says, \u2018the\r\nHoly Ghost, whom God hath given them that _obey_ him.\u2019 Obedience is\r\nthe key to every door. I am perplexed at the stupidity of the ordinary\r\nreligious being. In the most practical of all matters, he will talk,\r\nand speculate, and try to feel, but he will not set himself to _do_.\r\nIt is different with Malcolm. From the first he has been trying to\r\nobey. Nor do I see why it should be strange that even a child should\r\nunderstand these things, if they are the very elements of the region\r\nfor which we were created and to which our being holds essential\r\nrelations, as a bird to the air, or a fish to the sea. If a man may not\r\nunderstand the things of God whence he came, what shall he understand?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow, then, is it that so few do understand?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause where they know, so few obey. This boy, I say, did. If you\r\nhad seen, as I have, the almost superhuman struggles of his will to\r\nmaster the fierce temper his ancestors gave him, you would marvel less\r\nat what he has so early become. I have seen him, white with passion,\r\ncast himself on his face on the shore, and cling with his hands to\r\nthe earth as if in a paroxysm of bodily suffering; then after a few\r\nmoments rise and do a service to the man who had wronged him. Were it\r\nany wonder if the light should have soon gone up in a soul like that?\r\nWhen I was a younger man I used to go out with the fishing-boats now\r\nand then, drawn chiefly by my love for the boy, who earned his own\r\nbread that way before he was in his teens. One night we were caught in\r\na terrible storm, and had to stand out to sea in the pitch dark. He was\r\nthen not fourteen. \u2018Can you let a boy like that steer?\u2019 I said to the\r\ncaptain of the boat. \u2018Yes; just a boy like that,\u2019 he answered. \u2018Ma\u2019colm\r\n\u2019ill steer as straucht \u2019s a porpus.\u2019 When he was relieved, he crept\r\nover the thwarts to where I sat. \u2018_Is_ there any true definition of a\r\nstraight line, sir?\u2019 he said. \u2018I can\u2019t take the one in my Euclid.\u2019--\u2018So\r\nyou\u2019re not afraid, Malcolm?\u2019 I returned, heedless of his question, for\r\nI wanted to see what he would answer. \u2018Afraid, sir!\u2019 he rejoined with\r\nsome surprise, \u2018I wad ill like to hear the Lord say, _O thou o\u2019 little\r\nfaith!_\u2019--\u2018But,\u2019 I persisted, \u2018God may mean to drown you!\u2019--\u2018An\u2019 what\r\nfor no?\u2019 he returned. \u2018Gien ye war to tell me \u2019at I micht be droon\u2019t\r\nohn him meant it, I wad be fleyt eneuch.\u2019 I see your ladyship does not\r\nunderstand: I will interpret the dark saying: \u2018And why should he not\r\ndrown me? If you were to tell me I might be drowned without his meaning\r\nit, I should be frightened enough.\u2019 Believe me, my lady, the right way\r\nis simple to find, though only they that seek it _first_ can find it.\r\nBut I have allowed myself,\u201D concluded the schoolmaster, \u201Cto be carried\r\nadrift in my laudation of Malcolm. You did not come to hear praises of\r\nhim, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI owe him much,\u201D said Clementina. \u201C--But tell me then, Mr Graham, how\r\nis it that you know there is a God, and one--one--fit to be trusted as\r\nyou trust him?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIn no way that I can bring to bear on the reason of another so as to\r\nproduce conviction.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen what is to become of me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can do for you what is far better. I can persuade you to look and\r\nsee whether before your own door stands not a gate--lies not a path\r\nto walk in. Entering by that gate, walking in that path, you shall\r\nyourself arrive at the conviction, which no man can give you, that\r\nthere is a living Love and Truth at the heart of your being, and\r\npervading all that surrounds you. The man who seeks the truth in any\r\nother manner will never find it. Listen to me a moment, my lady. I\r\nloved that boy\u2019s mother. Naturally she did not love me--how could she?\r\nI was very unhappy. I sought comfort from the unknown source of my\r\nlife. He gave me to understand his Son, and so I understood himself,\r\nknew that I came of God, and was comforted.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut how do you know that it was not all a delusion--the product of\r\nyour own fervid imagination? Do not mistake me; I want to find it true.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is a right and honest question, my lady. I will tell you. Not to\r\nmention the conviction which a truth beheld must carry with itself and\r\nconcerning which there can be no argument either with him who does or\r\nhim who does not see it, this experience goes far with me, and would\r\nwith you if you had it, as you may--namely, that all my difficulties\r\nand confusions have gone on clearing themselves up ever since I set\r\nout to walk in that way. My consciousness of life is threefold what it\r\nwas; my perception of what is lovely around me, and my delight in it,\r\nthreefold; my power of understanding things and of ordering my way,\r\nthreefold also; the same with my hope and my courage, my love to my\r\nkind, my power of forgiveness. In short, I cannot but believe that my\r\nwhole being and its whole world are in process of rectification for\r\nme. Is not that something to set against the doubt born of the eye\r\nand ear, and the questions of an intellect that can neither grasp nor\r\ndisprove? I say nothing of better things still. To the man who receives\r\nsuch as I mean, they are the heart of life; to the man who does not,\r\nthey exist not. But I say--if I thus find my whole being enlightened\r\nand redeemed, and know that therein I fare according to the word of\r\nthe man of whom the old story tells: if I find that his word, and the\r\nresult of action founded upon that word, correspond and agree, opening\r\na heaven within and beyond me, in which I see myself delivered from\r\nall that now in myself is to myself despicable and unlovely; if I can\r\nreasonably--reasonably to myself, not to another --cherish hopes of a\r\nglory of conscious being, divinely better than all my imagination when\r\nmost daring could invent--a glory springing from absolute unity with my\r\ncreator, and therefore with my neighbour; if the Lord of the ancient\r\ntale, I say, has thus held word with me, am I likely to doubt much or\r\nlong whether there be such a lord or no?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat, then, is the way that lies before my own door? Help me to see\r\nit.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is just the old way--as old as the conscience--that of obedience\r\nto any and every law of personal duty. But if you have ever seen the\r\nLord, if only from afar--if you have any vaguest suspicion that the\r\nJew Jesus, who professed to have come from God, was a better man than\r\nother men, one of your first duties must be to open your ears to his\r\nwords, and see whether they commend themselves to you as true; then, if\r\nthey do, to obey them with your whole strength and might, upheld by the\r\nhope of the vision promised in them to the obedient. This is the way\r\nof life, which will lead a man out of the miseries of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, as it led Paul out of the miseries of the first.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere followed a little pause, and then a long talk about what the\r\nschoolmaster had called the old story; in which he spoke with such\r\nfervid delight of this and that point in the tale; removing this\r\nand that stumbling-block by giving the true reading--or the right\r\ninterpretation; showing the what and why and how--the very intent of\r\nour Lord in the thing he said or did, that, for the first time in\r\nher life, Clementina began to feel as if such a man must really have\r\nlived, that his blessed feet must really have walked over the acres\r\nof Palestine, that his human heart must indeed have thought and felt,\r\nworshipped and borne, right humanly. Even in the presence of her new\r\nteacher, and with his words in her ears, she began to desire her own\r\nchamber that she might sit down with the neglected story and read for\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster walked with her to the chapel door. There her carriage\r\nwas already waiting. He put her in, and, while the Reverend Jacob\r\nMasquar was still holding forth upon the difference between adoption\r\nand justification, Clementina drove away, never more to delight the\r\nhearts of the deacons with the noise of the hoofs of her horses,\r\nstaying the wheels of her yellow chariot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nTHE FEY FACTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Crathie heard of the outrage the people of Scaurnose had\r\ncommitted upon the surveyors, he vowed he would empty every house in\r\nthe place at Michaelmas. His wife warned him that such a wholesale\r\nproceeding must put him in the wrong with the country, seeing they\r\ncould not _all_ have been guilty. He replied it would be impossible,\r\nthe rascals hung so together, to find out the ringleaders even. She\r\nreturned that they all deserved it, and that a correct discrimination\r\nwas of no consequence; it would be enough to the purpose if he made a\r\ndifference. People would then say he had done his best to distinguish.\r\nThe factor was persuaded and made out a list of those who were to\r\nleave, in which he took care to include all the principal men, to whom\r\nhe gave warning forthwith to quit their houses at Michaelmas. I do not\r\nknow whether the notice was in law sufficient, but exception was not\r\ntaken on that score.\r\n\r\nScaurnose, on the receipt of the papers, all at the same time, by the\r\nhand of the bellman of Portlossie, was like a hive about to swarm.\r\nEndless and complicated were the comings and goings between the houses,\r\nthe dialogues, confabulations, and consultations, in the one street\r\nand its many closes. In the middle of it, in front of the little\r\npublic-house, stood, all that day and the next, a group of men and\r\nwomen, for no five minutes in its component parts the same, but, like\r\na cloud, ever slow-dissolving, and as continuously re-forming, some\r\ndropping away, others falling to. Such nid-nodding, such uplifting and\r\nfanning of palms among the women, such semi-revolving side-shakes of\r\nthe head, such demonstration of fists, and such cursing among the men,\r\nhad never before been seen and heard in Scaurnose. The result was a\r\nconclusion to make common cause with the first victim of the factor\u2019s\r\ntyranny, namely Blue Peter, whose expulsion would arrive three months\r\nbefore theirs, and was unquestionably head and front of the same cruel\r\nscheme for putting down the fisher-folk altogether.\r\n\r\nThree of them, therefore, repaired to Joseph\u2019s house, commissioned with\r\nthe following proposal and condition of compact: that Joseph should\r\ndefy the notice given him to quit, they pledging themselves that he\r\nshould not be expelled. Whether he agreed or not, they were equally\r\ndetermined, they said, when their turn came, to defend the village; but\r\nif he would cast in his lot with them, they would, in defending him,\r\ngain the advantage of having the question settled three months sooner\r\nfor themselves. Blue Peter sought to dissuade them, specially insisting\r\non the danger of bloodshed. They laughed. They had anticipated\r\nobjection, but being of the youngest and roughest in the place,\r\nthe idea of a scrimmage was, neither in itself nor in its probable\r\nconsequences, at all repulsive to them. They answered that a little\r\nblood-letting would do nobody any harm, neither would there be much\r\nof that, for they scorned to use any weapon sharper than their fists\r\nor a good thick _rung_: the women and children would take stones of\r\ncourse. Nobody would be killed, but every meddlesome authority taught\r\nto let Scaurnose and fishers alone. Peter objected that their enemies\r\ncould easily starve them out. Dubs rejoined that, if they took care to\r\nkeep the sea-door open, their friends at Portlossie would not let them\r\nstarve. Grosert said he made no doubt the factor would have the Seaton\r\nto fight as well as Scaurnose, for they must see plainly enough that\r\ntheir turn would come next. Joseph said the factor would apply to the\r\nmagistrates, and they would call out the militia.\r\n\r\n\u201CAn\u2019 we\u2019ll call out Buckie,\u201D answered Dubs.\r\n\r\n\u201CMan,\u201D said Fite Folp, the eldest of the three, \u201Cthe haill shore, frae\r\nthe Brough to Fort George, \u2019ll be up in a jiffie, an\u2019 a\u2019 the cuintry,\r\nfrae John o\u2019 Groat\u2019s to Berwick, \u2019ill hear hoo the fisher-fowk\u2019s\r\nmisguidit; an\u2019 at last it\u2019ll come to the king, an\u2019 _syne_ we\u2019ll get oor\r\nrichts, for he\u2019ll no stan\u2019 to see \u2019t, an\u2019 maitters \u2019ll sane be set upon\r\na better futtin\u2019 for puir fowk \u2019at has no freen\u2019 but God an\u2019 the sea.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe greatness of the result represented laid hold of Peter\u2019s\r\nimagination, and the resistance to injustice necessary to reach it\r\nstirred the old tar in him. When they took their leave, he walked\r\nhalfway up the street with them, and then returned to tell his wife\r\nwhat they had been saying, all the way murmuring to himself as he went,\r\n\u201CThe Lord is a man of war.\u201D And ever as he said the words, he saw as\r\nin a vision the great man-of-war in which he had served, sweeping\r\nacross the bows of a Frenchman, and raking him, gun after gun, from\r\nstem to stern. Nor did the warlike mood abate until he reached home\r\nand looked his wife in the eyes. He told her all, ending with the half\r\nrepudiatory, half-tentative words.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s what they say, ye see, Annie.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what say ye, Joseph?\u201D returned his wife.\r\n\r\n\u201COw! I\u2019m no sayin\u2019,\u201D he answered.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat are ye thinkin\u2019 than, Joseph?\u201D she pursued. \u201CYe canna say ye\u2019re\r\nno thinkin\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNa; I\u2019ll no say that, lass,\u201D he replied, but said no more.\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, gien ye winna say,\u201D resumed Annie, \u201CI wull; an\u2019 my say is, \u2019at\r\nit luiks to me unco like takin\u2019 things intill yer ain han\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAn\u2019 whase han\u2019 sud we tak them intill but oor ain?\u201D said Peter, with a\r\nfalseness which in another would have roused his righteous indignation.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s no the p\u2019int. It\u2019s whase han\u2019 ye\u2019re takin\u2019 them oot o\u2019,\u201D\r\nreturned she, and spoke with solemnity and significance.\r\n\r\nPeter made no answer, but the words _Vengeance is mine_ began to ring\r\nin his mental ears instead of _The Lord is a man of war_.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr Graham left them, and while Peter\u2019s soul was flourishing,\r\nhe would have simply said that it was their part to endure, and leave\r\nthe rest to the God of the sparrows. But now the words of men whose\r\njudgment had no weight with him, threw him back upon the instinct of\r\nself-defence--driven from which by the words of his wife, he betook\r\nhimself, not alas! to the protection, but to the vengeance of the Lord!\r\n\r\nThe next day he told the three commissioners that he was sorry to\r\ndisappoint them, but he could not make common cause with them, for\r\nhe could not see it his duty to resist, much as it would gratify the\r\nnatural man. They must therefore excuse him if he left Scaurnose at the\r\ntime appointed. He hoped he should leave friends behind him.\r\n\r\nThey listened respectfully, showed no offence, and did not even attempt\r\nto argue the matter with him. But certain looks passed between them.\r\n\r\nAfter this Blue Peter was a little happier in his mind, and went more\r\nbriskly about his affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nTHE WANDERER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely summer evening, and the sun, going down just beyond\r\nthe point of the Scaurnose, shone straight upon the Partan\u2019s door.\r\nThat it was closed in such weather had a significance--general as\r\nwell as individual. Doors were oftener closed in the Seaton now.\r\nThe spiritual atmosphere of the place was less clear and open than\r\nhitherto. The behaviour of the factor, the trouble of their neighbours,\r\nthe conviction that the man who depopulated Scaurnose would at least\r\nraise the rents upon them, had brought a cloud over the feelings and\r\nprospects of its inhabitants--which their special quarrel with the\r\noppressor for Malcolm\u2019s sake, had drawn deeper around the Findlays; and\r\nhence it was that the setting sun shone upon the closed door of their\r\ncottage.\r\n\r\nBut a shadow darkened it, cutting off the level stream of rosy red. An\r\naged man, in Highland garments, stood and knocked. His overworn dress\r\nlooked fresher and brighter in the friendly rays, but they shone very\r\nyellow on the bare hollows of his old knees. It was Duncan MacPhail,\r\nthe supposed grandfather of Malcolm. He was older and feebler--I\r\nhad almost said blinder, but that could not be-- certainly shabbier\r\nthan ever. The glitter of dirk and broadsword at his sides, and the\r\nmany-coloured ribbons adorning the old bagpipes under his arms, somehow\r\nenhanced the look of more than autumnal, of wintry desolation in his\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nBefore he left the Seaton, the staff he carried was for show rather\r\nthan use, but now he was bent over it, as if but for it he would fall\r\ninto his grave. His knock was feeble and doubtful, as if unsure of a\r\nwelcoming response. He was broken, sad, and uncomforted.\r\n\r\nA moment passed. The door was unlatched, and within stood the\r\nPartaness, wiping her hands in her apron, and looking thunderous. But\r\nwhen she saw who it was, her countenance and manner changed utterly.\r\n\r\n\u201CPreserve \u2019s a\u2019! Ye\u2019re a sicht for sair e\u2019en, Maister MacPhail!\u201D she\r\ncried, holding out her hand, which the blind man took as if he saw as\r\nwell as she. \u201CCome awa\u2019 but the hoose. Wow! but ye\u2019re walcome.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe thanks your own self, Mistress Partan,\u201D said Duncan, as he\r\nfollowed her in; \u201Cand her heart will pe thanking you for ta coot\r\nwelcome; and it will pe a long time since she\u2019ll saw you howefer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNoo, noo!\u201D exclaimed Meg, stopping in the middle of her little\r\nkitchen, as she was getting a chair for the old man, and turning upon\r\nhim to revive on the first possible chance what had been a standing\r\nquarrel between them, \u201Cwhat _can_ be the rizon \u2019at gars ane like you,\r\n\u2019at never saw man or wuman i\u2019 yer lang life, the verra meenute ye open\r\nyer mou\u2019, say it\u2019s lang sin\u2019 ye _saw_ me. A mensefu\u2019 body like you,\r\nMaister MacPhail, sud speyk mair to the p\u2019int.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTon\u2019t you\u2019ll pe preaking her heart with ta one hand while you\u2019ll pe\r\nclapping her head with ta other,\u201D said the piper. \u201CTon\u2019t be taking her\r\ninto your house to pe telling her she can\u2019t see. Is it that old Tuncan\r\nis not a man as much as any woman in ta world, tat you\u2019ll pe telling\r\nher she can\u2019t see? I tell you she _can_ see, and more tan you\u2019ll pe\r\nthink. And I will tell it to you, tere iss a pape in this house, and\r\ntere was pe none when Tuncan she\u2019ll co away.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe a\u2019 ken ye ha\u2019e the _second_ sicht,\u201D said Mrs Findlay, who had not\r\nexpected such a reply; \u201Can\u2019 it was only o\u2019 the first I spak. Haith! it\r\nwad be ill set o\u2019 me to anger ye the moment ye come back to yer ain.\r\nSit ye doon there by the chimla-neuk, till I mak ye a dish o\u2019 tay. Or\r\nmaybe ye wad prefar a drap o\u2019 parritch an\u2019 milk? It\u2019s no muckle I ha\u2019e\r\nto offer ye, but ye cudna be mair walcome.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs easily appeased as irritated, the old man sat down with a grateful,\r\nplacid look, and while the tea was _drawing_, Mrs Findlay, by judicious\r\nquestions, gathered from him the history of his adventures.\r\n\r\nUnable to rise above the disappointment and chagrin of finding that\r\nthe boy he loved as his own soul, and had brought up as his own son\r\nwas actually the child of a Campbell woman, one of the race to which\r\nbelonged the murderer of his people in Glencoe, and which therefore\r\nhe hated with an absolute passion of hatred; unable also to endure\r\nthe terrible schism in his being occasioned by the conflict between\r\nhorror at the Campbell blood, and ineffaceable affection for the\r\nyouth in whose veins it ran, and who so fully deserved all the love\r\nhe had lavished upon him, he had concluded to rid himself of all the\r\nassociations of place and people and event now grown so painful,\r\nto make his way back to his native Glencoe, and there endure his\r\nhumiliation as best he might, beheld of the mountains which had beheld\r\nthe ruin of his race. He would end the few and miserable days of his\r\npilgrimage amid the rushing of the old torrents, and the calling of\r\nthe old winds about the crags and precipices that had hung over his\r\ndarksome yet blessed childhood. These were still his friends. But he\r\nhad not gone many days\u2019 journey before a farmer found him on the road\r\ninsensible, and took him home. As he recovered, his longing after\r\nhis boy Malcolm grew, until it rose to agony, but he fought with his\r\nheart, and believed he had overcome it. The boy was a good boy, he\r\nsaid to himself; the boy had been to him as the son of his own heart;\r\nthere was no fault to find with him or in him; he was as brave as he\r\nwas kind, as sincere as he was clever, as strong as he was gentle; he\r\ncould play on the bagpipes, and very nearly talk Gaelic, but his mother\r\nwas a Campbell, and for that there was no help. To be on loving terms\r\nwith one in whose veins ran a single drop of the black pollution was\r\na thing no MacDhonuill must dream of. He had lived a man of honour,\r\nand he would die a man of honour, hating the Campbells to their last\r\ngeneration. How should the bard of his clan ever talk to his own soul\r\nif he knew himself false to the name of his fathers! Hard fate for him!\r\nAs if it were not enough that he had been doomed to save and rear a\r\nchild of the brood abominable, he was yet further doomed, worst fate of\r\nall, to love the evil thing! he could not tear the lovely youth from\r\nhis heart. But he could go further and further from him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was able, he resumed his journey westward, and at length\r\nreached his native glen, the wildest spot in all the island. There\r\nhe found indeed the rush of the torrents and the call of the winds\r\nunchanged, but when his soul cried out in its agonies, they went on\r\nwith the same song that had soothed his childhood; for the heart of the\r\nsuffering man they had no response. Days passed before he came upon\r\na creature who remembered him; for more than twenty years were gone,\r\nand a new generation had come up since he forsook the glen. Worst of\r\nall, the clan-spirit was dying out, the family type of government all\r\nbut extinct, the patriarchal vanishing in a low form of the feudal,\r\nitself already in abject decay. The hour of the Celt was gone by, and\r\nthe long-wandering raven, returning at last, found the ark it had left\r\nafloat on the waters dry and deserted and rotting to dust. There was\r\nnot even a cottage in which he could hide his head. The one he had\r\nforsaken when cruelty and crime drove him out, had fallen to ruins,\r\nand now there was nothing of it left but its foundations. The people\r\nof the inn at the mouth of the valley did their best for him, but he\r\nlearned by accident that they had Campbell connections, and, rising\r\nthat instant, walked from it for ever. He wandered about for a time,\r\nplaying his pipes, and everywhere hospitably treated; but at length\r\nhis heart could endure its hunger no more: he _must_ see his boy, or\r\ndie. He walked therefore straight to the cottage of his quarrelsome but\r\ntrue friend, Mrs Partan--to learn that his benefactor, the marquis,\r\nwas dead, and Malcolm gone. But here alone could he hope ever to see\r\nhim again, and the same night he sought his cottage in the grounds of\r\nLossie House, never doubting his right to re-occupy it. But the door\r\nwas locked, and he could find no entrance. He went to the House, and\r\nthere was referred to the factor. But when he knocked at his door, and\r\nrequested the key of the cottage, Mr Crathie, who was in the middle\r\nof his third tumbler, came raging out of his dining-room, cursed him\r\nfor an old Highland goat, and heaped insults on him and his grandson\r\nindiscriminately. It was well he kept the door between him and the\r\nold man, for otherwise he would never have finished the said third\r\ntumbler. That door carried in it thenceforth the marks of every weapon\r\nthat Duncan bore, and indeed the half of his sgian dhu[3] was the next\r\nmorning found sticking in it, like the sting which the bee is doomed to\r\nleave behind her. He returned to Mistress Partan white and trembling,\r\nin a mountainous rage with \u201Cta low-pred hount of a factor.\u201D Her\r\nsympathy was enthusiastic, for they shared a common wrath. And now came\r\nthe tale of the factor\u2019s cruelty to the fishers, his hatred of Malcolm,\r\nand his general wildness of behaviour. The piper vowed to shed the\r\nlast drop of his blood in defence of his Mistress Partan. But when, to\r\nstrengthen the force of his asseveration, he drew the dangerous-looking\r\ndirk from its sheath, she threw herself upon him, wrenched it from\r\nhis hand, and testified that \u201Cfules sudna hae chappin\u2019-sticks, nor\r\nyet teylors guns.\u201D It was days before Duncan discovered where she had\r\nhidden it. But not the less heartily did she insist on his taking up\r\nhis abode with her; and the very next day he resumed his old profession\r\nof lamp-cleaner to the community.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: or _skene dhu_]\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Horn heard that he had come and where he was, old feud with\r\nMeg Partan rendering it imprudent to call upon him, she watched for him\r\nin the street, and welcomed him home, assuring him that, if ever he\r\nshould wish to change his quarters, her house was at his service.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m nae Cam\u2019ell, ye ken, Duncan,\u201D she concluded, \u201Can\u2019 what an auld\r\nwuman like mysel\u2019 can du to mak ye coamfortable sall no fail, an\u2019 that\r\nI promise ye.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe old man thanked her with the perfect courtesy of the Celt,\r\nconfessed that he was not altogether at ease where he was, but said he\r\nmust not hurt the feelings of Mistress Partan, \u201Cfor she\u2019ll not pe a\r\npaad womans,\u201D he added, \u201Cbut her house will pe aalways in ta flames,\r\nhowefer.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo he remained where he was, and the general heart of the Seaton was\r\nnot a little revived by the return of one whose presence reminded them\r\nof a better time, when no such cloud as now threatened them heaved its\r\nragged sides above their horizon.\r\n\r\nThe factor was foolish enough to attempt inducing Meg to send her guest\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe want no landloupin\u2019 knaves, old or young, about Lossie,\u201D he\r\nsaid. \u201CIf the place is no keepit dacent, we\u2019ll never get the young\r\nmarchioness to come near \u2019s again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Deed, factor,\u201D returned Meg, enhancing the force of her utterance by\r\na composure marvellous from it\u2019s rarity, \u201Cthe first thing to mak the\r\nplace--I\u2019ll no say dacent, sae lang \u2019s there\u2019s sae mony claverin\u2019 wives\r\nin \u2019t, but mair dacent nor it has been for the last ten year, wad be to\r\nsen\u2019 factors back whaur they cam frae.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd whaur may that be?\u201D asked Mr Crathie.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s mair nor I richtly can say,\u201D answered Meg Partan, \u201Cbut\r\nauld-farand fouk threepit it was somewhaur \u2019ithin the swing o\u2019 Sawtan\u2019s\r\ntail.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe reply on the factor\u2019s lips as he left the house, tended to justify\r\nthe rude sarcasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nMID-OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere came a breath of something in the east. It was neither wind nor\r\nwarmth. It was light before it is light to the eyes of men. Slowly\r\nand slowly it grew, until, like the dawning soul in the face of one\r\nwho lies in a faint, the life of light came back to the world, and at\r\nlast the whole huge hollow hemisphere of rushing sea and cloud-flecked\r\nsky lay like a great empty heart, waiting, in conscious glory of the\r\nlight, for the central glory, the coming lord of day. And in the whole\r\ncrystalline hollow, gleaming and flowing with delight, yet waiting for\r\nmore, the Psyche was the only lonely life-bearing thing--the one cloudy\r\ngerm-spot afloat in the bosom of the great roc-egg of sea and sky,\r\nwhose sheltering nest was the universe with its walls of flame.\r\n\r\nFlorimel woke, rose, went on deck, and for a moment was fresh born. It\r\nwas a fore-scent--even this could not be called a foretaste, of the\r\nkingdom of heaven; but Florimel never thought of the kingdom of heaven,\r\nthe ideal of her own existence. She could however half appreciate this\r\nearthly outbreak of its glory, this incarnation of truth invisible.\r\nRound her, like a thousand doves, clamoured with greeting wings the\r\njoyous sea-wind. Up came a thousand dancing billows, to shout their\r\ngood morning. Like a petted animal, importunate for play, the breeze\r\ntossed her hair and dragged at her fluttering garments, then rushed\r\nin the Psyche\u2019s sails, swelled them yet deeper, and sent her dancing\r\nover the dancers. The sun peered up like a mother waking and looking\r\nout on her frolicking children. Black shadows fell from sail to sail,\r\nslipping and shifting, and one long shadow of the Psyche herself\r\nshot over the world to the very gates of the west, but held her not,\r\nfor she danced and leaned and flew as if she had but just begun her\r\ncorantolavolta fresh with the morning, and had not been dancing all the\r\nlivelong night over the same floor. Lively as any new-born butterfly,\r\nnot like a butterfly\u2019s, flitting and hovering, was her flight, for\r\nstill, like one that longed, she sped and strained and flew. The joy\r\nof bare life swelled in Florimel\u2019s bosom. She looked up, she looked\r\naround, she breathed deep. The cloudy anger that had rushed upon her\r\nlike a watching tiger the moment she waked, fell back, and left her\r\nsoul a clear mirror to reflect God\u2019s dream of a world. She turned, and\r\nsaw Malcolm at the tiller, and the cloudy wrath sprang upon her. He\r\nstood composed and clear and cool as the morning, without sign of doubt\r\nor conscience of wrong, now peeping into the binnacle, now glancing\r\nat the sunny sails, where swayed across and back the dark shadows of\r\nthe rigging, as the cutter leaned and rose, like a child running and\r\nstaggering over the multitudinous and unstable hillocks. She turned\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood morning, my lady! What a good morning it is!\u201D As in all his\r\naddress to his mistress, the freedom of the words did not infect the\r\ntone; that was resonant of essential honour. \u201CStrange to think,\u201D he\r\nwent on, \u201Cthat the sun himself there is only a great fire, and knows\r\nnothing about it! There must be a sun to that sun, or the whole thing\r\nis a vain show. There must be one to whom each is itself, yet the all\r\nmakes a whole--one who is at once both centre and circumference to all.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel cast on him a scornful look. For not merely was he talking his\r\nusual unintelligible rubbish of poetry, but he had the impertinence to\r\nspeak as if he had done nothing amiss, and she had no ground for being\r\noffended with him. She made him no answer. A cloud came over Malcolm\u2019s\r\nface; and until she went again below, he gave his attention to his\r\nsteering.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Rose, who happily had turned out as good a sailor as\r\nher new mistress, had tidied the little cabin; and Florimel found, if\r\nnot quite such a sumptuous breakfast laid as at Portland Place, yet a\r\nfar better appetite than usual to meet what there was; and when she had\r\nfinished, her temper was better, and she was inclined to think less\r\nindignantly of Malcolm\u2019s share in causing her so great a pleasure. She\r\nwas not yet quite spoiled. She was still such a lover of the visible\r\nworld and of personal freedom, that the thought of returning to London\r\nand its leaden-footed hours, would now have been unendurable. At this\r\nmoment she could have imagined no better thing than thus to go tearing\r\nthrough the water--home to her home. For although she had spent little\r\nof her life at Lossie House, she could not but prefer it unspeakably to\r\nthe schools in which she had passed almost the whole of the preceding\r\nportion of it. There was little or nothing in the affair she could have\r\nwished otherwise except its origin. She was mischievous enough to enjoy\r\neven the thought of the consternation it would cause at Portland Place.\r\nShe did not realize all its awkwardness. A letter to Lady Bellair when\r\nshe reached home would, she said to herself, set everything right;\r\nand if Malcolm had now repented and put about, she would instantly\r\nhave ordered him to hold on for Lossie. But it was mortifying that she\r\nshould have come at the will of Malcolm, and not by her own--worse than\r\nmortifying that perhaps she would have to say so. If she were going to\r\nsay so, she must turn him away as soon as she arrived. There was no\r\nhelp for it. She dared not keep him after that in the face of society.\r\nBut she might take the bold, and perhaps a little dangerous measure of\r\nadopting the flight as altogether her own madcap idea. Her thoughts\r\nwent floundering in the bog of expediency, until she was tired, and\r\ndeclined from thought to reverie.\r\n\r\nThen dawning out of the dreamland of her past, appeared the image of\r\nLenorme. Pure pleasure, glorious delight, such as she now felt, could\r\nnot long possess her mind, without raising in its charmed circle the\r\nvision of the only man except her father whom she had ever--something\r\nlike loved. Her behaviour to him had not yet roused in her shame or\r\nsorrow or sense of wrong. She had driven him from her; she was ashamed\r\nof her relation to him; she had caused him bitter suffering; she had\r\nall but promised to marry another man; yet she had not the slightest\r\nwish for that man\u2019s company there and then: with no one of her\r\nacquaintance but Lenorme could she have shared this conscious splendour\r\nof life.\r\n\r\n\u201CWould to God he had been born a gentleman instead of a painter!\u201D she\r\nsaid to herself when her imagination had brought him from the past, and\r\nset him in the midst of the present.\r\n\r\n\u201CRank,\u201D she said, \u201CI am above caring about. In that he might be ever so\r\nfar my inferior, and welcome, if only he had been of a good family, a\r\ngentleman born!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was generosity, magnanimity itself in her own eyes! Yet he was of\r\nfar better family than she knew, for she had never taken the trouble to\r\ninquire into his history. And now she was so much easier in her mind\r\nsince she had so cruelly broken with him, that she felt positively\r\nvirtuous because she had done it, and he was not at that moment by her\r\nside. And yet if he had that moment stepped from behind the main-sail,\r\nshe would in all probability have thrown herself into his arms.\r\n\r\nThe day passed on: Florimel grew tired and went to sleep; woke and had\r\nher dinner; took a volume of the \u201CArabian Nights,\u201D and read herself\r\nagain to sleep; woke again; went on deck; saw the sun growing weary\r\nin the west. And still the unwearied wind blew, and still the Psyche\r\ndanced on, as unwearied as the wind.\r\n\r\nThe sun-set was rather an assumption than a decease, a reception of him\r\nout of their sight into an eternity of gold and crimson; and when he\r\nwas gone, and the gorgeous bliss had withered into a dove-hued grief,\r\nthen the cool, soft twilight, thoughtful of the past and its love,\r\ncrept out of the western caves over the breast of the water, and filled\r\nthe dome and made of itself a great lens royal, through which the stars\r\nand their motions were visible; and the ghost of Aurora with both\r\nhands lifted her shroud above her head and made a dawn for the moon on\r\nthe verge of the watery horizon-- a dawn as of the past, the hour of\r\ninverted hope.\r\n\r\nNot a word all day had been uttered between Malcolm and his mistress:\r\nwhen the moon appeared, with the waves sweeping up against her face, he\r\napproached Florimel where she sat in the stern. Davy was steering.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill your ladyship come forward and see how the Psyche goes?\u201D he said.\r\n\u201CAt the stern, you can see only the passive part of her motion. It is\r\nquite another thing to see the will of her at work in the bows.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt first she was going to refuse; but she changed her mind, or her mind\r\nchanged her: she was not much more of a living and acting creature yet\r\nthan the Psyche herself. She said nothing, but rose, and permitted\r\nMalcolm to help her forward.\r\n\r\nIt was the moon\u2019s turn now to be level with the water, and as Florimel\r\nstood on the larboard side, leaning over and gazing down, she saw her\r\nshine through the little feather of spray the cutwater sent curling up\r\nbefore it, and turn it into pearls and semiopals.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s got a bone in her mouth, you see, my lady,\u201D said old Travers.\r\n\r\n\u201CGo aft till I call you, Travers,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\nRose was in Florimel\u2019s cabin, and they were now quite alone.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201CI can\u2019t bear to have you angry with me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen you ought not to deserve it,\u201D returned Florimel.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady, if you knew all, you would not say I deserved it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTell me all then, and let me judge.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot tell you all yet, but I will tell you something which may\r\nperhaps incline you to feel merciful. Did your ladyship ever think what\r\ncould make me so much attached to your father?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo indeed. I never saw anything peculiar in it. Even now-a-days there\r\nare servants to be found who love their masters. It seems to me natural\r\nenough. Besides he was very kind to you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was natural indeed, my lady--more natural than you think. Kind to\r\nme he was, and that was natural too.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNatural to him, no doubt, for he was kind to everybody.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy grandfather told you something of my early history--did he not, my\r\nlady?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes--at least I think I remember his doing so.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you recall it, and see whether it suggests nothing?\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Florimel could remember nothing in particular, she said. She had in\r\ntruth, for as much as she was interested at the time, forgotten almost\r\neverything of the story.\r\n\r\n\u201CI really cannot think what you mean,\u201D she added. \u201CIf you are going to\r\nbe mysterious, I shall resume my place by the tiller. Travers is deaf,\r\nand Davy is dumb: I prefer either.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cyour father knew my mother, and persuaded her\r\nthat he loved her.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel drew herself up, and would have looked him to ashes if wrath\r\ncould burn. Malcolm saw he must come to the point at once or the parley\r\nwould cease.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady,\u201D he said, \u201Cyour father was my father too. I am a son of the\r\nMarquis of Lossie, and your brother--your ladyship\u2019s half-brother, that\r\nis.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe looked a little stunned. The gleam died out of her eyes, and the\r\nglow out of her cheek. She turned and leaned over the bulwark. He said\r\nno more, but stood watching her. She raised herself suddenly, looked at\r\nhim, and said,\r\n\r\n\u201CDo I understand you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am your brother,\u201D Malcolm repeated.\r\n\r\nShe made a step forward, and held out her hand. He took the little\r\nthing in his great grasp tenderly. Her lip trembled. She gazed at him\r\nfor an instant, full in the face, with a womanly, believing expression.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy poor Malcolm!\u201D she said, \u201CI am sorry for you.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe withdrew her hand, and again leaned over the bulwark. Her heart was\r\nsoftened towards her groom-brother, and for a moment it seemed to her\r\nthat some wrong had been done. Why should the one be a marchioness and\r\nthe other a groom? Then came the thought that now all was explained.\r\nEvery peculiarity of the young man, every gift extraordinary of body,\r\nmind, or spirit, his strength, his beauty, his courage, and honesty,\r\nhis simplicity, nobleness, and affection, yes, even what in _him_ was\r\nmere doggedness and presumption, all, everything explained itself to\r\nFlorimel in the fact that the incomprehensible fisherman-groom, that\r\ntalked like a parson, was the son of her father. She never thought of\r\nthe woman that was his mother, and what share she might happen to have\r\nin the phenomenon --thought only of her father, and a little pitifully\r\nof the half-honour and more than half-disgrace infolding the very\r\nexistence of her attendant. As usual her thoughts were confused. The\r\none moment the poor fellow seemed to exist only on sufferance, having\r\nno right to be there at all, for as fine a fellow as he was; the next\r\nshe thought how immeasurably he was indebted to the family of the\r\nColonsays. Then arose the remembrance of his arrogance and presumption\r\nin assuming on such a ground something more than guardianship--\r\nabsolute tyranny over her, and with the thought pride and injury at\r\nonce got the upper hand. Was _she_ to be dictated to by a low-born,\r\nlow-bred fellow like that--a fellow whose hands were harder than any\r\nleather, not with doing things for his amusement but actually with\r\nearning his daily bread--one that used to smell so of fish --on the\r\nground of right too--and such a right as ought to exclude him for ever\r\nfrom her presence!--She turned to him again.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow long have you known this--this--painful--indeed I must confess to\r\nfinding it an awkward and embarrassing fact? I presume you _do_ know\r\nit?\u201D she said, coldly and searchingly.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy father confessed it on his death-bed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CConfessed!\u201D echoed Florimel\u2019s pride, but she restrained her tongue.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt explains much,\u201D she said, with a sort of judicial relief.\r\n\u201CThere has been a great change upon you since then. Mind I only say\r\n_explains_. It could never justify such behaviour as yours-- no, not if\r\nyou had been my true brother. There is some excuse, I daresay, to be\r\nmade for your ignorance and inexperience. No doubt the discovery turned\r\nyour head. Still I am at a loss to understand how you could imagine\r\nthat sort of--of--that sort of thing gave you any right over me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLove has its rights, my lady,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\nAgain her eyes flashed and her cheek flushed. \u201CI cannot permit you to\r\ntalk so to me. You must not fancy such things are looked upon in our\r\nposition with the same indifference as in yours. You must not flatter\r\nyourself that you can be allowed to cherish the same feelings towards\r\nme as if--as if--you were really my brother. I am sorry for you,\r\nMalcolm, as I said already; but you have altogether missed your mark if\r\nyou think that can alter facts, or shelter you from the consequences of\r\npresumption.\u201D\r\n\r\nAgain she turned away. Malcolm\u2019s heart was sore for her. How grievously\r\nshe had sunk from the Lady Florimel of the old days! It was all from\r\nbeing so constantly with that wretched woman and her vile nephew. Had\r\nhe been able to foresee such a rapid declension, he would have taken\r\nher away long ago, and let come of her feelings what might. He had been\r\ntoo careful over them.\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed,\u201D Florimel resumed, but this time without turning towards\r\nhim, \u201CI do not see how things can possibly, after what you have told\r\nme, remain as they are. I should not feel at all comfortable in\r\nhaving one about me who would be constantly supposing he had rights,\r\nand reflecting on my father for fancied injustice, and whom I fear\r\nnothing could prevent from taking liberties. It is very awkward\r\nindeed, Malcolm--very awkward! But it is your own fault that you are\r\nso changed, and I must say I should not have expected it of you. I\r\nshould have thought you had more good sense and regard for me. If I\r\nwere to tell the world why I wanted to keep you, people would but shrug\r\ntheir shoulders and tell me to get rid of you; and if I said nothing,\r\nthere would always be something coming up that required explanation.\r\nBesides, you would for ever be trying to convert me to one or other\r\nof your foolish notions. I hardly know what to do. I will consult--my\r\nfriends on the subject. And yet I would rather they knew nothing of it.\r\nMy father you see----\u201D She paused. \u201CIf you had been my real brother it\r\nwould have been different.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI _am_ your real brother, my lady, and I have tried to behave like one\r\never since I knew it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; you have been troublesome. I have always understood that brothers\r\nwere troublesome. I am told they are given to taking upon them the\r\ncharge of their sisters\u2019 conduct. But I would not have even you think\r\nme heartless. If you had been a _real_ brother, of course I should have\r\ntreated you differently.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t doubt it, my lady, for everything would have been different\r\nthen. I should have been the Marquis of Lossie, and you would have been\r\nLady Florimel Colonsay. But it would have made little difference in one\r\nthing: I could not have loved you better than I do now-- if only you\r\nwould believe it, my lady!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe emotion of Malcolm, evident in his voice as he said this, seemed to\r\ntouch her a little.\r\n\r\n\u201CI believe it, my poor Malcolm,\u201D she returned, \u201Cquite as much as I\r\nwant, or as it is pleasant to believe it. I think you would do a great\r\ndeal for me, Malcolm. But then you are so rude! take things into your\r\nhands, and do things for me I don\u2019t want done! You _will_ judge, not\r\nonly for yourself, but for me! How _can_ a man of your training and\r\nposition judge for a lady of mine! Don\u2019t you see the absurdity of it?\r\nAt times it has been very awkward indeed. Perhaps when I am married\r\nit might be arranged; but I don\u2019t know.\u201D Here Malcolm ground his\r\nteeth, but was otherwise irresponsive as block of stone. \u201CHow would a\r\ngamekeeper\u2019s place suit you? That is a half-gentlemanly kind of post. I\r\nwill speak to the factor, and see what can be done.--But on the whole I\r\n_think_, Malcolm, it will be better you should go. I am _very_ sorry.\r\nI wish you had not told me. It is very painful to me. You _should_ not\r\nhave told me. These things are not intended to be talked of.--Suppose\r\nyou were to marry--say----\u201D\r\n\r\nShe stopped abruptly, and it was well both for herself and Malcolm that\r\nshe caught back the name that was on her lips.\r\n\r\nThe poor girl must not be judged as if she had been more than a girl,\r\nor other than one with every disadvantage of evil training. Had she\r\nbeen four or five years older, she might have been a good deal worse,\r\nand have seemed better, for she would have kept much of what she had\r\nnow said to herself, and would perhaps have treated her brother more\r\nkindly while she cared even less for him.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat will you do with Kelpie, my lady?\u201D asked Malcolm quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere it is, you see!\u201D she returned. \u201CSo awkward! If you had not told\r\nme, things could have gone on as before, and for your sake I could have\r\npretended I came this voyage of my own will and pleasure. Now, I don\u2019t\r\nknow what I can do--except indeed you--let me see --if you were to hold\r\nyour tongue, and tell nobody what you have just told me--I don\u2019t know\r\nbut you might stay till you got her so far trained that another man\r\ncould manage her. I might even be able to ride her myself.--Will you\r\npromise?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will promise not to let the fact come out so long as I am in your\r\nservice, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAfter all that has passed, I think you might promise me a little more!\r\nBut I will not press it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMay I ask what it is, my lady?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am not going to press it, for I do not choose to make a favour\r\nof it. Still, I do not see that it would be such a mighty favour to\r\nask--of one who owes respect at least to the house of Lossie. But I\r\nwill not ask. I will only _suggest_, Malcolm, that you should leave\r\nthis part of the country--say this country altogether, and go to\r\nAmerica, or New South Wales, or the Cape of Good Hope. If you will take\r\nthe hint, and promise never to speak a word of this unfortunate--yes,\r\nI must be honest, and allow there is a _sort_ of relationship between\r\nus; but if you will keep it secret, I will take care that something is\r\ndone for you--something, I mean, more than you could have any right to\r\nexpect. And mind, I am not asking you to conceal anything that could\r\nreflect honour upon you or dishonour upon us.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI scarcely thought you would. Only you hold such grand ideas about\r\nself-denial, that I thought it might be agreeable to you to have an\r\nopportunity of exercising the virtue at a small expense and a great\r\nadvantage.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm was miserable. Who could have dreamed to find in her such a\r\nwoman of the world! He must break off the hopeless interview.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen, my lady,\u201D he said, \u201CI suppose I am to give my chief attention to\r\nKelpie, and things are to be as they have been.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFor the present. And as to this last piece of presumption, I will so\r\nfar forgive you as to take the proceeding on myself--mainly because\r\nit would have been my very choice had you submitted it to me. There\r\nis nothing I should have preferred to a sea-voyage and returning to\r\nLossie at this time of the year. But you also must be silent on your\r\ninsufferable share in the business. And for the other matter, the least\r\narrogance or assumption I shall consider to absolve me at once from\r\nall obligation towards you of any sort. Such relationships are _never_\r\nacknowledged.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you--sister,\u201D said Malcolm--a last forlorn experiment; and as he\r\nsaid the word he looked lovingly in her eyes.\r\n\r\nShe drew herself up like the princess Lucifera, \u201Cwith loftie eyes,\r\nhalfe loth to looke so lowe,\u201D and said, cold as ice,\r\n\r\n\u201CIf once I hear that word on your lips again, as between you and me,\r\nMalcolm, I shall that very moment discharge you from my service, as for\r\na misdemeanour. You have _no_ claim upon me, and the world will not\r\nblame me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly not, my lady. I beg your pardon. But there is one who\r\nperhaps will blame you a little.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI know what you mean; but I don\u2019t pretend to any of your religious\r\nmotives. When I do, then you may bring them to bear upon me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI was not so foolish as you think me, my lady. I merely imagined you\r\nmight be as far on as a Chinaman,\u201D said Malcolm, with a poor attempt at\r\na smile.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat insolence do you intend now?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Chinese, my lady, pay the highest respect to their departed\r\nparents. When I said there was one who would blame you a little, I\r\nmeant your father.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe touched his cap, and withdrew.\r\n\r\n\u201CSend Rose to me,\u201D Florimel called after him, and presently with her\r\nwent down to the cabin.\r\n\r\nAnd still the Psyche soul-like flew. Her earthly birth held her to the\r\nearth, but the ocean upbore her, and the breath of God drove her on.\r\nLittle thought Florimel to what she hurried her! A queen in her own\r\nself-sufficiency and condescension, she could not suspect how little\r\nof real queendom, noble and self-sustaining, there was in her being;\r\nfor not a soul of man or woman whose every atom leans not upon its\r\nfather-fact in God, can sustain itself when the outer wall of things\r\nbegins to tumble towards the centre, crushing it in on every side.\r\n\r\nDuring the voyage no further allusion was made by either to what had\r\npassed. By the next morning Florimel had yet again recovered her\r\ntemper, and, nothing fresh occurring to irritate her, kept it and was\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nMalcolm was only too glad to accept whatever parings of heart she might\r\noffer. By the time their flight was over, Florimel almost felt as if it\r\nhad indeed been undertaken at her own desire and motion, and was quite\r\nprepared to assert that such was the fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nTHE SHORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was two days after the longest day of the year, when there is no\r\nnight in those regions, only a long twilight, in which many dream and\r\ndo not know it. There had been a week of variable weather, with sudden\r\nchanges of wind to east and north, and round again by south to west,\r\nand then there had been a calm for several days. But now the little\r\nwind there was blew from the north-east; and the fervour of June was\r\nrendered more delicious by the films of flavouring cold that floated\r\nthrough the mass of heat. All Portlossie more and less, the Seaton\r\nespecially, was in a state of excitement, for its little neighbour,\r\nScaurnose, was more excited still. There the man most threatened, and\r\nwith greatest injustice, was the only one calm amongst the men, and\r\namongst the women his wife was the only one that was calmer than he.\r\nBlue Peter was resolved to abide the stroke of wrong, and not resist\r\nthe powers that were, believing them in some true sense, which he found\r\nit hard to understand when he thought of the factor as the individual\r\ninstance, ordained of God. He had a dim perception too that it was\r\nbetter that one, that one he, should suffer, than that order should be\r\ndestroyed and law defied. Suffering, he might still in patience possess\r\nhis soul, and all be well with him; but what would become of the\r\ncountry if everyone wronged were to take the law into his own hands?\r\nThousands more would be wronged by the lawless in a week than by unjust\r\npowers in a year. But the young men were determined to pursue their\r\nplan of resistance, and those of the older and soberer who saw the\r\nuselessness of it, gave themselves little trouble to change the minds\r\nof the rest.\r\n\r\nPeter, although he knew they were not for peace, neither inquired\r\nwhat their purpose might be, nor allowed any conjecture or suspicion\r\nconcerning it to influence him in his preparations for departure. Not\r\nthat he had found a new home. Indeed he had not heartily set about\r\nsearching for one; in part because, unconsciously to himself he was\r\nbuoyed up by the hope he read so clear in the face of his more trusting\r\nwife--that Malcolm would come to deliver them. His plan was to leave\r\nher and his children with certain friends at Port Gordon; he would\r\nnot hear of going to the Partans to bring them into trouble. He would\r\nhimself set out immediately after for the Lewis fishing.\r\n\r\nFew had gone to the Hebrides that year from Scaurnose or Portlossie.\r\nThe magnitude of the events that were about to take place, yet more\r\nthe excitement and interest they occasioned, kept the most of the men\r\nat home--to content themselves with fishing the waters of the Moray\r\nFrith. And they had notable success. But what was success with such a\r\ntyrant over them as the factor, threatening to harry their nests, and\r\nturn the sea birds and their young out of their heritage of rock and\r\nsand and shingle? They could not keep house on the waves, any more than\r\nthe gulls! Those who still held their religious assemblies in the cave\r\ncalled the Baillies\u2019 Barn, met often, read and sang the comminatory\r\npsalms more than any others, and prayed much against the wiles and\r\nforce of their enemies both temporal and spiritual; while Mr Crathie\r\nwent every Sunday to Church, grew redder in the nose, and hotter in the\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\nMiss Horn was growing more and more uncomfortable concerning events,\r\nand dissatisfied with Malcolm. She had not for some time heard from\r\nhim, and here was his most important duty unattended to-- she would\r\nnot yet say neglected--the well being of his tenantry, namely, left\r\nin the hands of an unsympathetic, self-important underling, who was\r\nfast losing all the good sense he had once possessed! Was the life and\r\nhistory of all these brave fishermen and their wives and children to be\r\npostponed to the pampered feelings of one girl, and that because she\r\nwas what she had no right to be, his half-sister forsooth? said Miss\r\nHorn to herself--that bosom friend to whom some people, and those not\r\nthe worst, say oftener what they do not mean than what they do. She had\r\nwritten to him within the last month a very hot letter indeed, which\r\nhad afforded no end of amusement to Mrs Catanach, as she sat in his\r\nold lodging over the curiosity shop, but, I need hardly say, had not\r\nreached Malcolm: and now there was but one night, and the best of all\r\nthe fisher-families would have nowhere to lie down! Miss Horn, with\r\nJoseph Mair, thought she did well to be angry with Malcolm.\r\n\r\nThe blind piper had been very restless all day. Questioned again and\r\nagain by Meg Partan as to what was amiss with him, he had always\r\nreturned her odd and evasive answers. Every few minutes he got up\r\n--even from cleaning her lamp--to go to the shore. He had but to cross\r\nthe threshold, and take a few steps through the _close_, to reach the\r\nroad that ran along the sea-front of the village: on the one side were\r\nthe cottages, scattered and huddled, on the other the shore and ocean\r\nwide outstretched. He would walk straight across this road until he\r\nfelt the sand under his feet; there stand for a few moments facing\r\nthe sea, and, with nostrils distended, breathing deep breaths of the\r\nair from the north-east; then turn and walk back to Meg Partan\u2019s\r\nkitchen, to resume his ministration of light. These his sallies were\r\nso frequent, and his absences so short, that a more serene temper than\r\nhers might have been fretted by them. But there was something about\r\nhis look and behaviour that, while it perplexed, restrained her; and\r\ninstead of breaking out upon him, she eyed him curiously.\r\n\r\nShe had found that it would not do to stare at him. The instant she\r\nbegan to do so, he began to fidget, and turned his back to her. It\r\nhad made her lose her temper for a moment, and declare aloud as her\r\nconviction that he was after all an impostor, and saw as well as any of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe has told you so, Mistress Partan, one hundred thousand times,\u201D\r\nreplied Duncan with an odd smile: \u201Cand perhaps she will pe see a little\r\npetter as any of you, no matter.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon she murmured to herself, \u201CThe cratur \u2019ill be seein\u2019\r\nsomething!\u201D and with mingled awe and curiosity sought to lay restraint\r\nupon her unwelcome observation of him.\r\n\r\nThus it went on the whole day, and as the evening approached, he grew\r\nstill more excited. The sun went down, and the twilight began; and,\r\nas the twilight deepened, still his excitement grew. Straightway it\r\nseemed as if the whole Seaton had come to share in it. Men and women\r\nwere all out of doors; and, late as it was when the sun set, to judge\r\nby the number of red legs and feet that trotted in and out with a\r\nlittle shadowy flash, with a dull patter-pat on earthen floor and hard\r\nroad, and a scratching and hustling among the pebbles, there could\r\nnot have been one older than a baby in bed; while of the babies even\r\nnot a few were awake in their mothers\u2019 arms, and out with them on the\r\nsea front. The men, with their hands in their trouser-pockets, were\r\nlazily smoking pigtail, in short-clay pipes with tin covers fastened\r\nto the stems by little chains, and some of the women, in short blue\r\npetticoats and worsted stockings, doing the same. Some stood in their\r\ndoors, talking with neighbours standing in their doors; but these were\r\nmostly the elder women: the younger ones-- all but Lizzy Findlay--were\r\nout in the road. One man half leaned, half sat on the window sill of\r\nDuncan\u2019s former abode, and round him were two or three more, and some\r\nwomen, talking about Scaurnose, and the factor, and what the lads would\r\ndo to-morrow; while the hush of the sea on the pebbles mingled with\r\ntheir talk, like an unknown tongue of the infinite--never articulating,\r\nonly suggesting-- uttering in song and not in speech--dealing not with\r\nthoughts, but with feelings and foretastes. No one listened: what to\r\nthem was the Infinite with Scaurnose in the near distance! It was now\r\nalmost as dark as it would be throughout the night if it kept as clear.\r\n\r\nOnce more there was Duncan, standing as if looking out to sea, and\r\nshading his brows with his hand as if to protect his eyes from the\r\nglare of the sun, and enable his sight!\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s the auld piper again!\u201D said one of the group, a young woman.\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s unco fule like to be stan\u2019in that gait (_way_), makin\u2019 as gien he\r\ncudna weel see for the sun in \u2019s e\u2019en.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHaud ye yer tongue, lass,\u201D rejoined an elderly woman beside her.\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s mair things nor ye ken, as the Beuk says. There\u2019s een \u2019at can\r\nsee an\u2019 een \u2019at canna, an\u2019 een \u2019at can see twise ower, an\u2019 een \u2019at can\r\nsee steikit what nane can see open.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTa poat! ta poat of my chief!\u201D cried the seer. \u201CShe is coming like a\r\ntream of ta night, put one tat will not tepart with ta morning.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe spoke as one suppressing a wild joy.\r\n\r\n\u201CWha\u2019ll that be, lucky-deddy (_grandfather_)?\u201D inquired, in a\r\nrespectful voice, the woman who had last spoken, while those within\r\nhearing hushed each other and stood in silence. And all the time the\r\nghost of the day was creeping round from west to east to put on its\r\nresurrection body, and rise new born. It gleamed faint like a cold ashy\r\nfire in the north.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd who will it pe than her own son, Mistress Reekie?\u201D answered the\r\npiper, calling her by her husband\u2019s nickname, as was usual, but, as was\r\nhis sole wont, prefixing the title of respect, where custom would have\r\nemployed but her Christian name.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho\u2019ll should it pe put her own Malcolm?\u201D he went on. \u201CI see his poat\r\ncome round ta Tead Head. She flits over the water like a pale ghost\r\nover Morven. But it\u2019s ta young and ta strong she is pringing home to\r\nTuncan. O m\u2019anam, beannuich!\u201D\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily all eyes turned towards the point called the Death\u2019s\r\nHead, which bounded the bay on the east.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s ower dark to see onything,\u201D said the man on the window sill.\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a bit haar (_fog_) come up.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Duncan, \u201Cit\u2019ll pe too tark for you who haf cot no eyes\r\nonly to speak of. Put your\u2019ll wait a few, and you\u2019ll pe seeing as well\r\nas herself. Och, her poy! her poy! O m\u2019anam! Ta Lort pe praised! and\r\nshe\u2019ll tie in peace, for he\u2019ll pe only ta one half of him a Cam\u2019ell,\r\nand he\u2019ll pe safed at last, as sure as there\u2019s a heafen to co to and a\r\nhell to co from. For ta half tat\u2019s not a Cam\u2019ell must pe ta strong half\r\nand it will trag ta other half into heafen-- where it will not pe ta\r\nwelcome, howefer.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs if to get rid of the unpleasant thought that his Malcolm could not\r\nenter heaven without taking half a Campbell with him, he turned from\r\nthe sea and hurried into the house--but only to catch up his pipes and\r\nhasten out again, filling the bag as he went. Arrived once more on the\r\nverge of the sand, he stood again facing the north-east, and began to\r\nblow a pibroch loud and clear.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Partan had joined the same group, and they were talking in\r\na low tone about the piper\u2019s claim to the second sight, for, although\r\nall were more or less inclined to put faith in Duncan, there was\r\nhere no such unquestioning belief in the marvel as would have been\r\nfound on the west coast in every glen from the Mull of Cantyre to\r\nLoch Eribol--when suddenly Meg Partan, almost the only one hitherto\r\nremaining in the house, appeared rushing from the close.\r\n\r\n\u201CHech, sirs!\u201D she cried, addressing the Seaton in general, \u201Cgien the\r\nauld man be i\u2019 the richt,----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019ll pe aal in ta right, Mistress Partan, and tat you\u2019ll pe seeing,\u201D\r\nsaid Duncan, who, hearing her first cry, had stopped his drone, and\r\nplayed softly, listening.\r\n\r\nBut Meg went on without heeding him any more than was implied in the\r\nrepetition of her exordium.\r\n\r\n\u201CGien the auld man be i\u2019 the richt, it\u2019ll be the marchioness hersel\u2019\r\n\u2019at\u2019s h\u2019ard o\u2019 the ill duin\u2019s o\u2019 her factor, an\u2019s comin\u2019 to see efter\r\nher fowk! An\u2019 it\u2019ll be Ma\u2019colm\u2019s duin\u2019, an\u2019 that\u2019ll be seen. But the\r\nbonny laad winna ken the state o\u2019 the herbour, an\u2019 he\u2019ll be makin\u2019 for\r\nthe moo\u2019 o\u2019 \u2019t, an\u2019 he\u2019ll jist rin \u2019s bonny boatie agrun\u2019 \u2019atween the\r\ntwa piers, an\u2019 that\u2019ll no be a richt hame-comin\u2019 for the leddy o\u2019 the\r\nlan\u2019, an\u2019 what\u2019s mair, Ma\u2019colm \u2019ill get the wyte (_blame_) o\u2019 \u2019t, an\u2019\r\nthat\u2019ll be seen. Sae ye maun some o\u2019 ye to the pier-heid, an\u2019 luik oot\r\nto gie \u2019im warnin\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\nHer own husband was the first to start, proud of the foresight of his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\u201CHaith, Meg!\u201D he cried, \u201Cye\u2019re maist as guid at the lang sicht as the\r\npiper himsel\u2019!\u201D\r\n\r\nSeveral followed him, and as they ran, Meg cried after them, giving her\r\norders as if she had been vice-admiral of the red, in a voice shrill\r\nenough to pierce the worst gale that ever blew on northern shore.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe\u2019ll jist tell the bonnie laad to haud wast a bit an\u2019 rin her ashore,\r\nan\u2019 we\u2019ll a\u2019 be there an\u2019 hae her as dry \u2019s Noah\u2019s ark in a jiffie.\r\nTell her leddyship we\u2019ll cairry the boat, an\u2019 her intill \u2019t, to the tap\r\no\u2019 the Boar\u2019s Tail, gien she\u2019ll gie \u2019s her orders.-- Winna we, laads?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe can but try!\u201D said one. \u201C--But the Fisky \u2019ill be waur to get a grip\r\no\u2019 nor Nancy here,\u201D he added, turning suddenly upon the plumpest girl\r\nin the place, who stood next to him. She foiled him however of the kiss\r\nhe had thought to snatch, and turned the laugh from herself upon him,\r\nso cleverly avoiding his clutch that he staggered into the road, and\r\nnearly fell upon his nose.\r\n\r\nBy the time the Partan and his companions reached the pier-head,\r\nsomething was dawning in the vague of sea and sky that might be a\r\nsloop and standing for the harbour. Thereupon the Partan and Jamie\r\nLadle jumped into a small boat and pulled out. Dubs, who had come from\r\nScaurnose on the business of the conjuration, had stepped into the\r\nstern, not to steer but to show a white ensign--somebody\u2019s Sunday shirt\r\nhe had gathered, as they ran, from a furze-bush, where it hung to dry,\r\nbetween the Seaton and the harbour.\r\n\r\n\u201CHoots! ye\u2019ll affront the marchioness,\u201D objected the Partan.\r\n\r\n\u201CMan, i\u2019 the gloamin\u2019 she\u2019ll no ken \u2019t frae buntin\u2019,\u201D said Dubs, and at\r\nonce displayed it, holding it by the two sleeves.\r\n\r\nThe wind had now fallen to the softest breath, and the little vessel\r\ncame on slowly. The men rowed hard, shouting, and waving their flag,\r\nand soon heard a hail which none of them could mistake for other\r\nthan Malcolm\u2019s. In a few minutes they were on board, greeting their\r\nold friend with jubilation, but talking in a subdued tone, for they\r\nperceived by Malcolm\u2019s that the cutter bore their lady.\r\n\r\nBriefly the Partan communicated the state of the harbour, and\r\nrecommended porting his helm, and running the Fisky ashore about\r\nopposite the brass swivel.\r\n\r\n\u201CA\u2019 the men an\u2019 women i\u2019 the Seaton,\u201D he said, \u201C\u2019ill be there to haul\r\nher up.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm took the helm, gave his orders, and steered further westward.\r\nBy this time the people on shore had caught sight of the cutter. They\r\nsaw her come stealing out of the thin dark like a thought half thought,\r\nand go gliding along the shore like a sea-ghost over the dusky water,\r\nfaint, uncertain, noiseless, glimmering. It could be no other than\r\nthe Fisky! Both their lady and their friend Malcolm must be on board,\r\nthey were certain, for how could the one of them come without the\r\nother? and doubtless the marchioness, whom they all remembered as a\r\ngood-humoured handsome young lady, never shy of speaking to anybody,\r\nhad come to deliver them from the hateful red-nosed ogre, her factor!\r\nOut at once they all set, along the shore to greet her arrival, each\r\nrunning regardless of the rest, so that from the Seaton to the middle\r\nof the Boar\u2019s Tail there was a long, straggling broken string of\r\nhurrying fisher-folk, men and women, old and young, followed by all the\r\ncurrent children, tapering to one or two toddlers, who felt themselves\r\nneglected and wept their way along. The piper, too asthmatic to run,\r\nbut not too asthmatic to walk and play his bagpipes, delighting the\r\nheart of Malcolm, who could not mistake the style, believed he brought\r\nup the rear, but was wrong; for the very last came Mrs Findlay and\r\nLizzy, carrying between them their little deal kitchen-table, for her\r\nladyship to step out of the boat upon, and Lizzy\u2019s child fast asleep on\r\nthe top of it.\r\n\r\nThe foremost ran and ran until they saw that the Psyche had chosen\r\nher couch, and was turning her head to the shore, when they stopped\r\nand stood ready with greased planks and ropes to draw her up. In a\r\nfew moments the whole population was gathered, darkening, in the June\r\nmidnight, the yellow sands between the tide and dune. The Psyche was\r\nwell manned now with a crew of six. On she came under full sail till\r\nwithin a few yards of the beach, when, in one and the same moment,\r\nevery sheet was let go, and she swept softly up like a summer wave,\r\nand lay still on the shore. The butterfly was asleep. But ere she came\r\nto rest, the instant indeed that her canvas went fluttering away,\r\nthirty strong men had rushed into the water and laid hold of the now\r\nbroken-winged thing. In a few minutes she was high and dry.\r\n\r\nMalcolm leaped on the sand just as the Partaness came bustling up with\r\nher kitchen-table between her two hands like a tray. She set it down,\r\nand across it shook hands with him violently; then caught it up and\r\ndeposited it firm on its four legs beneath the cutter\u2019s waist.\r\n\r\n\u201CNoo, my leddy,\u201D said Meg, looking up at the marchioness, \u201Cset ye yer\r\nbit fut upo\u2019 my table, an\u2019 we\u2019ll think the mair o\u2019 \u2019t efter, whan we\r\ntak oor denner aff o\u2019 \u2019t.\u201D\r\n\r\nFlorimel thanked her, stepped lightly upon it, and sprang to the sand,\r\nwhere she was received with words of welcome from many, and shouts\r\nwhich rendered them inaudible from the rest. The men, their bonnets in\r\ntheir hands, and the women courtesying, made a lane for her to pass\r\nthrough, while the young fellows would gladly have begged leave to\r\ncarry her, could they have extemporised any suitable sort of palanquin\r\nor triumphal litter.\r\n\r\nFollowed by Malcolm, she led the way over the Boar\u2019s Tail--nor would\r\naccept any help in climbing it--straight for the tunnel: Malcolm had\r\nnever laid aside the key to the private doors his father had given\r\nhim while he was yet a servant. They crossed by the embrasure of the\r\nbrass swivel. That implement had now long been silent, but they had\r\nnot gone many paces from the bottom of the dune when it went off with\r\na roar. The shouts of the people drowned the startled cry with which\r\nFlorimel, involuntarily mindful of old and for her better times,\r\nturned to Malcolm. She had not looked for such a reception, and was\r\nboth flattered and touched by it. For a brief space the spirit of\r\nher girlhood came back. Possibly, had she then understood that hope\r\nrather than faith or love was at the heart of their enthusiasm, that\r\nher tenants looked upon her as their saviour from the factor, and\r\nsorely needed the exercise of her sovereignty, she might have better\r\nunderstood her position, and her duty towards them.\r\n\r\nMalcolm unlocked the door of the tunnel, and she entered, followed by\r\nRose, who felt as if she were walking in a dream. As he stepped in\r\nafter them, he was seized from behind, and clasped close in an embrace\r\nhe knew at once.\r\n\r\n\u201CDaddy, daddy!\u201D he said, and turning threw his arms round the piper.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy poy! my poy! Her nain son Malcolm!\u201D cried the old man in a whisper\r\nof intense satisfaction and suppression. \u201CYou\u2019ll must pe forgifing her\r\nfor coming pack to you. She cannot help lofing you, and you must forget\r\ntat you are a Cam\u2019ell.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm kissed his cheek, and said, also in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\u201CMy ain daddy! I ha\u2019e a heap to tell ye, but I maun see my leddy hame\r\nfirst.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCo, co, this moment co,\u201D cried the old man, pushing him away. \u201CTo your\r\ntuties to my leddyship first, and then come to her old daddy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll be wi\u2019 ye in half an hoor or less.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCoot poy! coot poy! Come to Mistress Partan\u2019s.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, ay, daddy!\u201D said Malcolm, and hurried through the tunnel.\r\n\r\nAs Florimel approached the ancient dwelling of her race, now her own to\r\ndo with as she would, her pleasure grew. Whether it was the twilight,\r\nor the breach in dulling custom, everything looked strange, the\r\ngrounds wider, the trees larger, the house grander and more anciently\r\nvenerable. And all the way the burn sang in the hollow. The spirit of\r\nher father seemed to hover about the place, and while the thought that\r\nher father\u2019s voice would not greet her when she entered the hall, cast\r\na solemn funereal state over her simple return, her heart yet swelled\r\nwith satisfaction and far-derived pride. All this was hers to work her\r\npleasure with, to confer as she pleased! No thought of her tenants,\r\nfishers or farmers, who did their strong part in supporting the ancient\r\ndignity of her house, had even an associated share in the bliss of the\r\nmoment. She had forgotten her reception already, or regarded it only as\r\nthe natural homage to such a position and power as hers. As to owing\r\nanything in return, the idea had indeed been presented to her when with\r\nClementina and Malcolm she talked over \u201CSt Ronan\u2019s Well,\u201D but it had\r\nnever entered her mind.\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room and the hall were lighted. Mrs Courthope was at\r\nthe door as if she expected her, and Florimel was careful to take\r\neverything as a matter of course.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen will your ladyship please to want me?\u201D asked Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CAt the usual hour, Malcolm,\u201D she answered.\r\n\r\nHe turned, and ran to the Seaton.\r\n\r\nHis first business was the accommodation of Travers and Davy, but he\r\nfound them already housed at the Salmon, with Jamie Ladle teaching\r\nTravers to drink toddy. They had left the Psyche snug: she was high\r\nabove high-water mark, and there were no tramps about; they had furled\r\nher sails, locked the companion-door, and left her.\r\n\r\nMrs Findlay rejoiced over Malcolm as if he had been her own son from a\r\nfar country; but the poor piper between politeness and gratitude on the\r\none hand, and the urging of his heart on the other, was sorely tried\r\nby her loquacity: he could hardly get in a word. Malcolm perceived his\r\nsuffering, and, as soon as seemed prudent, proposed that he should walk\r\nwith him to Miss Horn\u2019s, where he was going to sleep, he said, that\r\nnight. Mrs Partan snuffed, but held her peace. For the third or fourth\r\ntime that day, wonderful to tell, she restrained herself!\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were out of the house, Malcolm assured Duncan, to the\r\nold man\u2019s great satisfaction, that, had he not found him there, he\r\nwould, within another month, have set out to roam Scotland in search of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMiss Horn had heard of their arrival, and was wandering about the\r\nhouse, unable even to sit down until she saw the marquis. To herself\r\nshe always called him the marquis; to his face he was always _Ma\u2019colm_.\r\nIf he had not come, she declared she could not have gone to bed--yet\r\nshe received him with an edge to her welcome: he had to answer for\r\nhis behaviour. They sat down, and Duncan told a long sad story; which\r\nfinished, with the toddy that had sustained him during the telling, the\r\nold man thought it better, for fear of annoying his Mistress Partan, to\r\ngo home. As it was past one o\u2019clock, they both agreed.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd if she\u2019ll tie to-night, my poy,\u201D said Duncan, \u201Cshe\u2019ll pe lie awake\r\nin her crave all ta long tarkness, to pe waiting to hear ta voice of\r\nyour worrts in ta morning. And nefer you mind, Malcolm, she\u2019ll has\r\nlearned to forgife you for peing only ta one half of yourself a cursed\r\nCam\u2019ell.\u201D\r\n\r\nMiss Horn gave Malcolm a wink, as much as to say, \u201CLet the old\r\nman talk. It will hurt no Campbell,\u201D and showed him out with much\r\nattention. And then at last Malcolm poured forth his whole story,\r\nand his heart with it, to Miss Horn, who heard and received it with\r\nunderstanding, and a sympathy which grew ever as she listened. At\r\nlength she declared herself perfectly satisfied, for not only had he\r\ndone his best, but she did not see what else he could have done. She\r\nhoped, however, that now he would contrive to get this part over as\r\nquickly as possible, for which, in the morning, she would, she said,\r\nshow him cogent reasons.\r\n\r\n\u201CI ha\u2019e no feelin\u2019s mysel\u2019, as ye weel ken, laddie,\u201D she remarked in\r\nconclusion, \u201Can\u2019 I doobt, gien I had been i\u2019 your place, I wadna hae\r\nluikit to a\u2019 sides o\u2019 the thing at ance as ye hae dune.-- An\u2019 it was a\r\nman like you \u2019at sae near lost yer life for the hizzy!\u201D she exclaimed.\r\n\u201CI maunna think aboot it, or I winna sleep a wink. But we maun get that\r\ndeevil Catanach (an\u2019 cat eneuch!) hangt. Weel, my man, ye may haud\r\nup yer heid afore the father o\u2019 ye, for ye\u2019re the first o\u2019 the race,\r\nI\u2019m thinkin\u2019, \u2019at ever was near-han\u2019 deein\u2019 for anither. But mak ye a\r\nspeedy en\u2019 till \u2019t noo, laad, an\u2019 fa\u2019 to the lave o\u2019 yer wark. There\u2019s\r\na terrible heap to be dune. But I maun haud my tongue the nicht, for\r\nI wad fain ye had a guid sleep, an\u2019 I\u2019m needin\u2019 ane sair mysel\u2019, for\r\nI\u2019m no sae yoong as I ance was, an\u2019 I ha\u2019e been that anxious aboot\r\nye, Ma\u2019colm, \u2019at though I never hed ony feelin\u2019s, yet, noo \u2019at a\u2019 \u2019s\r\ngaein\u2019 richt, an\u2019 ye\u2019re a\u2019 richt, and like to be richt for ever mair,\r\nmy heid\u2019s jist like to split. Gang yer wa\u2019s to yer bed, and soon may\r\nye sleep. It\u2019s the bed yer bonny mither got a soon\u2019 sleep in at last,\r\nand muckle was she i\u2019 the need o\u2019 \u2019t!

That\u2019s what comes o\u2019\r\nhaein\u2019 no feelin\u2019s. Ither fowk wad ha\u2019e gotten rid o\u2019 her half a score\r\nyears sin\u2019 syne.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE TRENCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMalcolm had not yet, after all the health-giving of the voyage,\r\nentirely recovered from the effects of the ill-compounded potion.\r\nIndeed, sometimes the fear crossed his mind that never would he be the\r\nsame man again, that the slow furnace of the grave alone would destroy\r\nthe vile deposit left in his house of life. Hence it came that he was\r\nweary, and overslept himself the next day--but it was no great matter;\r\nhe had yet time enough. He swallowed his breakfast as a working man\r\nalone can, and set out for Duff Harbour. At Leith, where they had put\r\nin for provisions, he had posted a letter to Mr Soutar, directing him\r\nto have Kelpie brought on to his own town, whence he would fetch her\r\nhimself. The distance was about ten miles, the hour eight, and he was a\r\ngood enough walker, although boats and horses had combined to prevent\r\nhim, he confessed, from getting over-fond of Shanks\u2019 mare. To men\r\nwho delight in the motions of a horse under them, the legs of a man\r\nare a tame, dull means of progression, although they too have their\r\nsuperiorities; and one of the disciplines of this world is to have to\r\nget out of the saddle and walk afoot. He who can do so with perfect\r\nserenity, must very nearly have learned with St Paul in whatsoever\r\nstate he is therein to be content. It was the loveliest of mornings,\r\nhowever, to be abroad in upon any terms, and Malcolm hardly needed\r\nthe resources of one who knew both how to be abased and how to abound\r\n--enviable perfection---for the enjoyment of even a long walk. Heaven\r\nand earth were just settling to the work of the day after their morning\r\nprayer, and the whole face of things yet wore something of that look\r\nof expectation which one who mingled the vision of the poet with the\r\nfaith of the Christian might well imagine to be their upward look of\r\nhope after a night of groaning and travailing --the earnest gaze of\r\nthe creature waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God; and\r\nfor himself, though the hardest thing was yet to come, there was a\r\nsatisfaction in finding himself almost up to his last fence, with the\r\nheavy ploughed land through which he had been floundering nearly all\r\nbehind him--which figure means that he had almost made up his mind what\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the Duff Arms, he walked straight into the yard, where\r\nthe first thing he saw was a stable boy in the air, hanging on to a\r\ntwitch on the nose of the rearing Kelpie. In another instant he would\r\nhave been killed or maimed for life, and Kelpie loose, and scouring\r\nthe streets of Duff Harbour. When she heard Malcolm\u2019s voice and the\r\nsound of his running feet, she stopped as if to listen. He flung the\r\nboy aside and caught her halter. Once or twice more she reared, in the\r\nvain hope of so ridding herself of the pain that clung to her lip and\r\nnose, nor did she, through the mist of her anger and suffering, quite\r\nrecognize her master in his yacht uniform. But the torture decreasing,\r\nshe grew able to scent his presence, welcomed him with her usual glad\r\nwhinny, and allowed him to do with her as he would.\r\n\r\nHaving fed her, found Mr Soutar, and arranged several matters with him,\r\nhe set out for home.\r\n\r\nThat was a ride! Kelpie was mad with life. Every available field he\r\njumped her into, and she tore its element of space at least to shreds\r\nwith her spurning hoofs. But the distance was not great enough to\r\nquiet her before they got to hard turnpike and young plantations. He\r\nwould have entered at the grand gate, but found no one at the lodge,\r\nfor the factor, to save a little, had dismissed the old keeper. He had\r\ntherefore to go on, and through the town, where, to the awe-stricken\r\neyes of the population peeping from doors and windows, it seemed as\r\nif the terrible horse would carry him right over the roofs of the\r\nfisher-cottages below, and out to sea.\r\n\r\n\u201CEh, but he\u2019s a terrible cratur that Ma\u2019colm MacPhail!\u201D said the old\r\nwives to each other, for they felt there must be something wicked in\r\nhim to ride like that. But he turned her aside from the steep hill, and\r\npassed along the street that led to the town-gate of the House.--Whom\r\nshould he see, as he turned into it, but Mrs Catanach!--standing on her\r\nown doorstep, opposite the descent to the Seaton, shading her eyes with\r\nher hand, and looking far out over the water through the green smoke of\r\nthe village below. As long as he could remember her, it had been her\r\nwont to gaze thus; though what she could at such times be looking for,\r\nexcept it were the devil in person, he found it hard to conjecture.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his approach she turned; and such an expression crossed\r\nher face in a momentary flash ere she disappeared in the house, as\r\nadded considerably to his knowledge of fallen humanity. Before he\r\nreached her door she was out again, tying on a clean white apron as she\r\ncame, and smiling like a dark pool in sunshine. She dropped him a low\r\ncourtesy, and looked as if she had been occupying her house for months\r\nof his absence. But Malcolm would not meet even cunning with its own\r\nweapons, and therefore turned away his head, and took no notice of her.\r\nShe ground her teeth with the fury of hate, and swore that she would\r\nyet disappoint him of his purpose, whatever it were, in this masquerade\r\nof service. Her heart being scarcely of the calibre to comprehend one\r\nlike Malcolm\u2019s, her theories for the interpretation of the mystery were\r\nsomewhat wild, and altogether of a character unfit to see the light.\r\n\r\nThe keeper of the town-gate greeted Malcolm, as he let him in, with a\r\npleased old face and words of welcome; but added instantly, as if it\r\nwas no time for the indulgence of friendship, that it was a terrible\r\nbusiness going on at the Nose.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is it?\u201D asked Malcolm, in alarm.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe ha\u2019e been ower lang awa\u2019, I doobt,\u201D answered the man, \u201Cto ken hoo\r\nthe factor----But, Lord save ye! haud yer tongue,\u201D he interjected,\r\nlooking fearfully around him. \u201CGien he kenned \u2019at I said sic a thing,\r\nhe wad turn me oot o\u2019 hoose an\u2019 ha\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve said nothing yet,\u201D rejoined Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CI said _factor_, an\u2019 that same\u2019s \u2019maist eneuch, for he\u2019s like a\r\nroarin\u2019 lion an\u2019 a ragin\u2019 bear amang the people, an\u2019 that sin\u2019 ever ye\r\ngaed. Bow-o\u2019-meal said i\u2019 the meetin\u2019 the ither nicht \u2019at he bude to\r\nbe the verra man, the wickit ruler propheseed o\u2019 sae lang sin\u2019 syne i\u2019\r\nthe beuk o\u2019 the Proverbs. Eh! it\u2019s an awfu\u2019 thing to be foreordeent to\r\noonrichteousness!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you haven\u2019t told me what is the matter at Scaurnose,\u201D said Malcolm\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\u201COw, it\u2019s jist this--at this same \u2019s midsimmer-day, an\u2019 Blew Peter,\r\nhonest fallow! he\u2019s been for the last three month un\u2019er nottice frae\r\nthe factor to quit. An\u2019 sae, ye see,----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTo quit!\u201D exclaimed Malcolm. \u201CSic a thing was never h\u2019ard tell o\u2019!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHaith! it\u2019s h\u2019ard tell o\u2019 noo,\u201D returned the gatekeeper. \u201CQuittin\u2019\r\n\u2019s as plenty as quicken (_couch-grass_). \u2019Deed there\u2019s maist naething\r\nither h\u2019ard tell o\u2019 _bit_ quittin\u2019; for the full half o\u2019 Scaurnose is\r\nun\u2019er like nottice for Michaelmas, an\u2019 the Lord kens what it\u2019ll a\u2019 en\u2019\r\nin!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut what\u2019s it for? Blue Peter\u2019s no the man to misbehave himsel\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, ye ken mair yersel\u2019 nor ony ither as to the warst fau\u2019t there is\r\nto lay till \u2019s chairge; for they say--that is, _some_ say, it\u2019s a\u2019 yer\r\nain wyte, Ma\u2019colm.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat mean ye, man?

The factor he\u2019s there, I ken, an\u2019 some constables wi\u2019\r\n\u2019im--to see \u2019at his order\u2019s cairried oot. An\u2019 the laads they ha\u2019e been\r\nfortifeein\u2019 the place--as they ca\u2019 \u2019t--for the last oor. They\u2019ve howkit\r\na trenk, they tell me, \u2019at nane but a hunter on \u2019s horse cud win ower,\r\nan\u2019 they\u2019re postit alang the toon side o\u2019 \u2019t wi\u2019 sticks an\u2019 stanes,\r\nan\u2019 boat-heuks, an\u2019 guns an\u2019 pistils. An\u2019 gien there bena a man or twa\r\nkillt a\u2019ready,----\u201D\r\n\r\nBefore he finished his sentence, Kelpie was levelling herself for the\r\nsea-gate.\r\n\r\nJohnny Bykes was locking it on the other side, in haste to secure his\r\neye-share of what was going on, when he caught sight of Malcolm tearing\r\nup. Mindful of the old grudge, also that there was no marquis now\r\nto favour his foe, he finished the arrested act of turning the key,\r\ndrew it from the lock, and to Malcolm\u2019s orders, threats, and appeals,\r\nreturned for all answer that he had no time to attend to _him_, and\r\nso left him looking through the bars. Malcolm dashed across the burn,\r\nand round the base of the hill on which stood the little windgod\r\nblowing his horn, dismounted, unlocked the door in the wall, got Kelpie\r\nthrough, and was in the saddle again before Johnny was half-way from\r\nthe gate. When the churl saw him, he trembled, turned, and ran for its\r\nshelter again in terror--nor perceived until he reached it, that the\r\ninsulted groom had gone off like the wind in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nMalcolm soon left the high road and cut across the fields--over which\r\nthe wind bore cries and shouts, mingled with laughter and the animal\r\nsounds of coarse jeering. When he came nigh the cart-road which led\r\ninto the village, he saw at the entrance of the street a crowd, and\r\nrising from it the well-known shape of the factor on his horse.\r\nNearer the sea, where was another entrance through the back-yards of\r\nsome cottages, was a smaller crowd. Both were now pretty silent, for\r\nthe attention of all was fixed on Malcolm\u2019s approach. As he drew up\r\nKelpie foaming and prancing, and the group made way for her, he saw\r\na deep wide ditch across the road, on whose opposite side was ranged\r\nirregularly the flower of Scaurnose\u2019s younger manhood, calmly, even\r\nmerrily prepared to defend their entrenchment. They had been chaffing\r\nthe factor, and loudly challenging the constables to come on, when they\r\nrecognised Malcolm in the distance, and expectancy stayed the rush of\r\ntheir bruising wit. For they regarded him as beyond a doubt come from\r\nthe marchioness with messages of goodwill. When he rode up, therefore,\r\nthey raised a great shout, everyone welcoming him by name. But the\r\nfactor, who, to judge by appearances, had had his forenoon dram ere\r\nhe left home, burning with wrath, moved his horse in between Malcolm\r\nand the assembled Scaurnoseans on the other side of the ditch. He had\r\nself-command enough left, however, to make one attempt at the loftily\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\n\u201CPray what is your business?\u201D he said, as if he had never seen Malcolm\r\nin his life before, \u201CI presume you come with a message.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI come to beg you, sir, not to go further with this business. Surely\r\nthe punishment is already enough!\u201D said Malcolm respectfully.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho sends me the message?\u201D asked the factor, his teeth clenched, and\r\nhis eyes flaming.\r\n\r\n\u201COne,\u201D answered Malcolm, \u201Cwho has some influence for justice, and will\r\nuse it, upon whichever side the justice may lie.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGo to hell,\u201D cried the Factor, losing utterly his slender\r\nself-command, and raising his whip.\r\n\r\nMalcolm took no heed of the gesture, for he was at the moment beyond\r\nhis reach.\r\n\r\n\u201CMr Crathie,\u201D he said calmly, \u201Cyou are banishing the best man in the\r\nplace.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo doubt! no doubt! seeing he\u2019s a crony of yours,\u201D laughed the factor\r\nin mighty scorn. \u201CA canting, prayer-meeting rascal!\u201D he added.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that ony waur nor a drucken elyer o\u2019 the kirk?\u201D cried Dubs from the\r\nother side of the ditch, raising a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\nThe very purple forsook the factor\u2019s face, and left it a corpse-like\r\ngrey in the fire of his fury.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, come, my men! that\u2019s going too far,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CAn\u2019 wha ir ye for a fudgie (_truant_) fisher, to gi\u2019e coonsel ohn\r\nspeired?\u201D shouted Dubs, altogether disappointed in the poor part\r\nMalcolm seemed taking. \u201CHaud to the factor there wi\u2019 yer coonsel.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGet out of my way,\u201D said Mr Crathie, still speaking through his set\r\nteeth, and came straight upon Malcolm. \u201CHome with you! or--r--r----\u201D\r\n\r\nAgain he raised his whip, this time plainly with intent.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor God\u2019s sake, factor, min\u2019 the mere,\u201D cried Malcolm. \u201CRibs an\u2019 legs\r\nan\u2019 a\u2019 \u2019ill be to crack, gien ye anger her wi\u2019 yer whuppin\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he drew a little aside that the factor might pass if he\r\npleased. A noise arose in the smaller crowd, and Malcolm turned to see\r\nwhat it meant: off his guard, he received a stinging cut over the head\r\nfrom the factor\u2019s whip. Simultaneously, Kelpie stood up on end, and\r\nMalcolm tore the weapon from the treacherous hand.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I gave you what you deserve, Mr Crathie, I should knock you and\r\nyour horse together into that ditch. A touch of the spur would do\r\nit. I am not quite sure that I ought not. A nature like yours takes\r\nforbearance for fear.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, his mare was ramping and kicking, making a clean sweep\r\nall about her. Mr Crathie\u2019s horse turned restive from sympathy, and it\r\nwas all his rider could do to keep his seat. As soon as he got Kelpie\r\na little quieter, Malcolm drew near and returned him his whip. He\r\nsnatched it from his outstretched hand, and essayed a second cut at\r\nhim, which Malcolm rendered powerless by pushing Kelpie close up to\r\nhim. Then suddenly wheeling, he left him.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the trench the fellows were shouting and roaring\r\nwith laughter.\r\n\r\n\u201CMen,\u201D cried Malcolm, \u201Cyou have no right to stop up this road. I want\r\nto go and see Blue Peter.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCome on,\u201D cried one of the young men, emulous of Dubs\u2019s humour, and\r\nspread out his arms as if to receive Kelpie to his bosom.\r\n\r\n\u201CStand out of the way then,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201CI _am_ coming.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he took Kelpie a little round, keeping out of the way of\r\nthe factor, who sat trembling with rage on his still excited animal,\r\nand sent her at the trench.\r\n\r\nThe Deevil\u2019s Jock, as they called him, kept jumping, with his arms\r\noutspread, from one place to another, as if to receive Kelpie\u2019s charge,\r\nbut when he saw her actually coming, in short, quick bounds, straight\r\nto the trench, he was seized with terror, and, half-paralysed, slipped\r\nas he turned to flee, and rolled into the ditch, just in time to let\r\nKelpie fly over his head. His comrades scampered right and left, and\r\nMalcolm, rather disgusted, took no notice of them.\r\n\r\nA cart, loaded with their little all, the horse in the shafts, was\r\nstanding at Peter\u2019s door, but nobody was near it. Hardly was Malcolm\r\nwell into the close, however, when out rushed Annie, and, heedless of\r\nKelpie\u2019s demonstrative repellence, reached up her hands like a child,\r\ncaught him by the arm, while yet he was busied with his troublesome\r\ncharge, drew him down towards her, and held him till, in spite of\r\nKelpie, she had kissed him again and again.\r\n\r\n\u201CEh, Ma\u2019colm! eh, my lord!\u201D she said, \u201Cye ha\u2019e saved my faith. I kenned\r\nye wad come!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHaud yer tongue, Annie. I mauna be kenned,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s nae danger. They\u2019ll tak it for sweirin\u2019,\u201D answered Annie,\r\nlaughing and crying both at once.\r\n\r\nOut next came Blue Peter, his youngest child in his arms.\r\n\r\n\u201CEh, Peter man! I\u2019m blythe to see ye,\u201D cried Malcolm. \u201CGie \u2019s a grup o\u2019\r\nyer honest han\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\nMore than even the sight of his face beaming with pleasure, more than\r\nthat grasp of the hand that would have squeezed the life out of a\r\npole-cat, was the sound of the mother-tongue from his lips. The cloud\r\nof Peter\u2019s long distrust broke and vanished, and the sky of his soul\r\nwas straightway a celestial blue. He snatched his hand from Malcolm\u2019s,\r\nwalked back into the empty house, ran into the little closet off\r\nthe kitchen, bolted the door, fell on his knees in the void little\r\nsanctuary that had of late been the scene of so many foiled attempts to\r\nlift up his heart, and poured out speechless thanksgiving to the God of\r\nall grace and consolation, who had given him back his friend, and that\r\nin the time of his sore need. So true was his heart in its love, that,\r\ngiving thanks for his friend, he forgot that friend was the Marquis of\r\nLossie, before whom his enemy was but as a snail in the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen he rose from his knees, and went out again, his face shining and\r\nhis eyes misty, his wife was on the top of the cart, tying a rope\r\nacross the cradle.\r\n\r\n\u201CPeter,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cye was quite richt to gang, but I\u2019m glaid they\r\ndidna lat ye.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wad ha\u2019e been half w\u2019y to Port Gordon or noo,\u201D said Peter.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut noo ye\u2019ll no gang to Port Gordon,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CYe\u2019ll jist gang\r\nto the Salmon for a feow days, till we see hoo things gang.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll du onything ye like, Ma\u2019colm,\u201D said Peter, and went into the\r\nhouse to fetch his bonnet.\r\n\r\nIn the street arose the cry of a woman, and into the close rushed one\r\nof the fisher-wives, followed by the factor. He had found a place on\r\nthe eastern side of the village, where, jumping a low earth wall, he\r\ngot into a little back yard, and was trampling over its few stocks of\r\nkail, and its one dusty miller and double daisy, when the woman to\r\nwhose cottage it belonged caught sight of him through the window, and\r\nrunning out fell to abusing him in no measured language. He rode at her\r\nin his rage, and she fled shrieking into Peter\u2019s close, where she took\r\nrefuge behind the cart, never ceasing her vituperation, but calling him\r\nevery choice name in her vocabulary. Beside himself with the rage of\r\nmurdered dignity, he rode up, and struck at her over the corner of the\r\ncart, whereupon, from the top of it, Annie Mair ventured to expostulate.\r\n\r\n\u201CHoot, sir! It\u2019s no mainners to lat at a wuman like that.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe turned upon her, and gave her a cut on the arm and hand, so stinging\r\nthat she cried out, and nearly fell from the cart. Out rushed Peter and\r\nflew at the factor, who from his seat of vantage began to ply his whip\r\nabout his head. But Malcolm, who, when the factor appeared, had moved\r\naside to keep Kelpie out of mischief, and saw only the second of the\r\ntwo assaults, came forward with a scramble and a bound.\r\n\r\n\u201CHaud awa\u2019, Peter,\u201D he cried. \u201CThis belangs to me. I ga\u2019e him back \u2019s\r\nwhup, an\u2019 sae I\u2019m accoontable.--Mr Crathie,\u201D--and as he spoke he edged\r\nhis mare up to the panting factor, \u201Cthe man who strikes a woman must be\r\ntaught that he is a scoundrel, and that office I take. I would do the\r\nsame if you were the lord of Lossie instead of his factor.\u201D\r\n\r\nMr Crathie, knowing himself now in the wrong, was a little frightened\r\nat the set speech, and began to bluster and stammer, but the swift\r\ndescent of Malcolm\u2019s heavy riding whip on his shoulders and back made\r\nhim voluble in curses. Then began a battle that could not last long\r\nwith such odds on the side of justice. It was gazed at from the mouth\r\nof the close by many spectators, but none dared enter because of the\r\ncapering and plunging and kicking of the horses. In less than a minute\r\nthe factor turned to flee, and spurring out of the court, galloped up\r\nthe street at full stretch.\r\n\r\n\u201CHaud oot o\u2019 the gait,\u201D cried Malcolm, and rode after him. But more\r\ncareful of the people, he did not get a good start, and the factor\r\nwas over the trench and into the fields before he caught him up. Then\r\nagain the stinging switch buckled about the shoulders of the oppressor,\r\ndriven with all the force of Malcolm\u2019s brawny arm. The factor yelled\r\nand cursed and swore, and still Malcolm plied the whip, and still the\r\nhorses flew--over fields and fences and ditches. At length in the last\r\nfield, from which they must turn into the high road, the factor groaned\r\nout--\r\n\r\n\u201CFor God\u2019s sake, Ma\u2019colm, ha\u2019e mercy!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe youth\u2019s uplifted arm fell by his side. He turned his mare\u2019s head,\r\nand when the factor turned his, he saw the avenger already halfway back\r\nto Scaurnose, and the constables in full flight meeting him.\r\n\r\nWhile Malcolm was thus occupied, his sister was writing to Lady\r\nBellair. She told her that, having gone out for a sail in her yacht,\r\nwhich she had sent for from Scotland, the desire to see her home had\r\noverpowered her to such a degree that of the intended sail she had\r\nmade a voyage, and here she was, longing just as much now to see Lady\r\nBellair; and if she thought proper to bring a gentleman to take care\r\nof her, he also should be welcomed for her sake. It was a long way for\r\nher to come, she said, and Lady Bellair knew what sort of a place it\r\nwas; but there was nobody in London now, and if she had nothing more\r\nenticing on her tablets, &c., &c. She ended with begging her, if she\r\nwas mercifully inclined to make her happy with her presence, to bring\r\nto her Caley and her hound Demon. She had hardly finished when Malcolm\r\npresented himself.\r\n\r\nShe received him very coldly, and declined to listen to anything about\r\nthe fishers. She insisted that, being one of their party, he was\r\nprejudiced in their favour; and that of course a man of Mr Crathie\u2019s\r\nexperience must know better than he what ought to be done with such\r\npeople, in view of protecting her rights, and keeping them in order.\r\nShe declared that she was not going to disturb the old way of things\r\nto please him; and said that he had now done her all the mischief he\r\ncould, except, indeed, he were to head the fishers and sack Lossie\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nMalcolm found that, by making himself known to her as her brother,\r\nhe had but given her confidence in speaking her mind to him, and set\r\nher free from considerations of personal dignity when she desired\r\nto humiliate him. But he was a good deal surprised at the ability\r\nwith which she set forth and defended her own view of her affairs,\r\nfor she did not tell him that the Rev. Mr Cairns had been with her\r\nall the morning, flattering her vanity, worshipping her power, and\r\ngenerally instructing her in her own greatness--also putting in a\r\nword or two anent his friend Mr Crathie and his troubles with her\r\nladyship\u2019s fisher-tenants. She was still, however, so far afraid of her\r\nbrother--which state of feeling was, perhaps, the main cause of her\r\ninsulting behaviour to him--that she sat in some dread lest he might\r\nchance to see the address of the letter she had been writing.\r\n\r\nI may mention here that Lady Bellair accepted the invitation with\r\npleasure for herself and Liftore, promised to bring Caley, but utterly\r\ndeclined to take charge of Demon, or allow him to be of the party.\r\nThereupon Florimel, who was fond of the animal, and feared much, as\r\nhe was no favourite, that something would _happen_ to him, wrote to\r\nClementina, praying her to visit her in her lovely loneliness --good\r\nas The Gloom in its way, though not quite so dark--and to add a hair\r\nto the weight of her obligations if she complied, by allowing her\r\ndeerhound to accompany her. Clementina was the only one, she said, of\r\nher friends for whom the animal had ever shown a preference.\r\n\r\nMalcolm retired from his sister\u2019s presence much depressed, saw Mrs\r\nCourthope, who was kind as ever, and betook himself to his own room,\r\nnext to that in which his strange history began. There he sat down\r\nand wrote urgently to Lenorme, stating that he had an important\r\ncommunication to make, and begging him to start for the north the\r\nmoment he received the letter. A messenger from Duff Harbour well\r\nmounted, he said, would ensure his presence within a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nHe found the behaviour of his old acquaintances and friends in the\r\nSeaton much what he had expected: the few were as cordial as ever,\r\nwhile the many still resented, with a mingling of the jealousy of\r\naffection, his forsaking of the old life for a calling they regarded\r\nas unworthy of one bred at least if not born a fisherman. A few there\r\nwere besides who always had been, for reasons perhaps best known to\r\nthemselves, less than friendly. The women were all cordial.\r\n\r\n\u201CSic a mad-like thing,\u201D said old Futtocks, who was now the leader of\r\nthe assembly at the barn, \u201Cto gang scoorin\u2019 the cuintry on that mad\r\nbrute o\u2019 a mere!

They were put in\r\ngreat heart by Malcolm\u2019s espousal of their cause, as they considered\r\nhis punishment of the factor; but most of them set it down in their\r\nwisdom as resulting from the popular condemnation of his previous\r\nsupineness. It did not therefore add greatly to his influence with\r\nthem. When he would have prevailed upon them to allow Blue Peter to\r\ndepart, arguing that they had less right to prevent than the factor\r\nhad to compel him, they once more turned upon him: what right had he\r\nto dictate to them? he did not belong to Scaurnose! He reasoned with\r\nthem that the factor, although he had not justice, had law on his side,\r\nand could turn out whom he pleased. They said--\u201CLet him try it!\u201D He\r\ntold them that they had given great provocation, for he knew that the\r\nmen they had assaulted came surveying for a harbour, and that they\r\nought at least to make some apology for having maltreated them. It was\r\nall useless: that was the women\u2019s doing, they said; besides they did\r\nnot believe him; and if what he said was true, what was the thing to\r\nthem, seeing they were all under notice to leave? Malcolm said that\r\nperhaps an apology would be accepted. They told him, if he did not take\r\nhimself off, they would serve him as he had served the factor. Finding\r\nexpostulation a failure, therefore, he begged Joseph and Annie to\r\nsettle themselves again as comfortably as they could, and left them.\r\n\r\nContrary to the expectation of all, however, and considerably to the\r\ndisappointment of the party of Dubs, Fite Folp, and the rest, the next\r\nday was as peaceful as if Scaurnose had been a halcyon nest floating\r\non the summer waves; and it was soon reported that, in consequence of\r\nthe punishment he had received from Malcolm, the factor was far too\r\nill to be troublesome to any but his wife. This was true, but, severe\r\nas his chastisement was, it was not severe enough to have had any such\r\nconsequences but for his late growing habit of drinking whisky. As\r\nit was, fever had followed upon the combination of bodily and mental\r\nsuffering. But already it had wrought this good in him, that he was far\r\nmore keenly aware of the brutality of the offence of which he had been\r\nguilty than he would otherwise have been all his life through. To his\r\nwife, who first learned the reason of Malcolm\u2019s treatment of him from\r\nhis delirious talk in the night, it did not, circumstances considered,\r\nappear an enormity, and her indignation with the avenger of it, whom\r\nshe had all but hated before, was furious. Malcolm, on his part, was\r\ngreatly concerned to hear the result of his severity. He refrained,\r\nhowever, from calling to inquire, knowing it would be interpreted as\r\nan insult, not accepted as a sign of sympathy. He went to the doctor\r\ninstead--who, to his consternation, looked very serious at first. But\r\nwhen he learned all about the affair, he changed his view considerably,\r\nand condescended to give good hopes of his coming through, even adding\r\nthat it would lengthen his life by twenty years if it broke him of his\r\nhabits of whisky-drinking and rage.\r\n\r\nAnd now Malcolm had a little time of leisure, which he put to the best\r\npossible use in strengthening his relations with the fishers. For\r\nhe had nothing to do about the House, except look after Kelpie; and\r\nFlorimel, as if determined to make him feel that he was less to her\r\nthan before, much as she used to enjoy seeing him sit his mare, never\r\ntook him out with her--always Stoat. He resolved therefore, seeing he\r\nmust yet delay action a while in the hope of the appearance of Lenorme,\r\nto go out as in the old days after the herring, both for the sake of\r\nsplicing, if possible, what strands had been broken between him and\r\nthe fishers, and of renewing for himself the delights of elemental\r\nconflict. With these views, he hired himself to the Partan, whose\r\nboat\u2019s crew was short-handed. And now, night after night, he revelled\r\nin the old pleasure, enhanced by so many months of deprivation. Joy\r\nitself seemed embodied in the wind blowing on him out of the misty\r\ninfinite while his boat rocked and swung on the waters, hanging between\r\ntwo worlds, that in which the wind blew, and that other dark-swaying\r\nmystery whereinto the nets to which it was tied went away down and\r\ndown, gathering the harvest of the ocean. It was as if nature called\r\nup all her motherhood to greet and embrace her long absent son.\r\nWhen it came on to blow hard, as it did once and again during those\r\nsummer nights, instead of making him feel small and weak in the midst\r\nof the storming forces, it gave him a glorious sense of power and\r\nunconquerable life. And when his watch was out, and the boat lay quiet,\r\nlike a horse tethered and asleep in his clover-field, he too would fall\r\nasleep with a sense of simultaneously deepening and vanishing delight\r\nsuch as he had not at all in other conditions experienced. Ever since\r\nthe poison had got into his system, and crept where it yet lay lurking\r\nin hidden corners and crannies, a noise at night would on shore startle\r\nhim awake, and set his heart beating hard; but no loudest sea-noise\r\never woke him; the stronger the wind flapped its wings around him, the\r\ndeeper he slept. When a comrade called him by name, he was up at once\r\nand wide awake.\r\n\r\nIt answered also all his hopes in regard to his companions and the\r\nfisher-folk generally. Those who had really known him found the same\r\nold Malcolm, and those who had doubted him soon began to see that at\r\nleast he had lost nothing in courage or skill or goodwill: ere long\r\nhe was even a greater favourite than before. On his part, he learned\r\nto understand far better the nature of his people, as well as the\r\nindividual characters of them, for his long (but not too long) absence\r\nand return enabled him to regard them with unaccustomed, and therefore\r\nin some respects more discriminating eyes.\r\n\r\nDuncan\u2019s former dwelling happening to be then occupied by a lonely\r\nwoman, Malcolm made arrangements with her to take them both in; so\r\nthat in relation to his grandfather too something very much like the\r\nold life returned for a time--with this difference, that Duncan soon\r\nbegan to check himself as often as the name of his hate, with its\r\naccompanying curse, rose to his lips.\r\n\r\nThe factor continued very ill. He had sunk into a low state, in which\r\nhis former indulgence was greatly against him. Every night the fever\r\nreturned, and at length his wife was worn out with watching and waiting\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nAnd every morning Lizzy Findlay, without fail, called to inquire how Mr\r\nCrathie had spent the night. To the last, while quarrelling with every\r\none of her neighbours with whom he had anything to do, he had continued\r\nkind to her, and she was more grateful than one in other trouble than\r\nhers could have understood. But she did not know that an element in the\r\norigination of his kindness was the belief that it was by Malcolm she\r\nhad been wronged and forsaken.\r\n\r\nAgain and again she had offered, in the humblest manner, to ease his\r\nwife\u2019s burden by sitting with him at night; and at last, finding she\r\ncould hold up no longer, Mrs Crathie consented. But even after a week\r\nshe found herself still unable to resume the watching, and so, night\r\nafter night, resting at home during a part of the day, Lizzy sat by the\r\nsleeping factor, and when he woke, ministered to him like a daughter.\r\nNor did even her mother object, for sickness is a wondrous reconciler.\r\n\r\nLittle did the factor suspect, however, that it was partly for\r\nMalcolm\u2019s sake she nursed him, anxious to shield the youth from any\r\npossible consequences of his righteous vengeance.\r\n\r\nWhile their persecutor lay thus, gradually everything at Scaurnose,\r\nand consequently at the Seaton, lapsed into its old way, and the\r\nsummer of such content as before they had possessed, returned to the\r\nfishers. I fear it would have proved hard for some of them, had they\r\nmade effort in that direction, to join in the prayer, if prayer it\r\nmay be called, put up in church for him every Sunday. What a fearful\r\ncanopy the prayers that do not get beyond the atmosphere would make\r\nif they turned brown with age! Having so lately seen the factor going\r\nabout like a maniac, raving at this piece of damage and that heap\r\nof dirt, the few fishers present could never help smiling when Mr\r\nCairns prayed for him as \u201Cthe servant of God and his church now lying\r\ngrievously afflicted--persecuted, but not forsaken, cast down, but not\r\ndestroyed;\u201D--having found the fitting phrases he seldom varied them.\r\n\r\nThrough her sorrow, Lizzy had grown tender, as through her shame\r\nshe had grown wise. That the factor had been much in the wrong only\r\nrendered her anxious sympathy the more eager to serve him. Knowing so\r\nwell what it was to have done wrong, she was pitiful over him, and her\r\nministrations were none the less devoted that she knew exactly how\r\nMalcolm thought and felt about him; for the affair, having taken place\r\nin open village and wide field and in the light of mid-day, and having\r\nbeen reported by eye-witnesses many, was everywhere perfectly known,\r\nand Malcolm therefore talked of it freely to his friends, amongst them\r\nboth to Lizzy and her mother.\r\n\r\nSickness sometimes works marvellous changes, and the most marvellous on\r\npersons who to the ordinary observer seem the least liable to change.\r\nMuch apparent steadfastness of nature, however, is but sluggishness,\r\nand comes from incapacity to generate change or contribute towards\r\npersonal growth; and it follows that those whose nature is such can\r\nas little prevent or retard any change that has its initiative beyond\r\nthem. The men who impress the world as the mightiest are those often\r\nwho _can_ the least--never those who can the most in their natural\r\nkingdom; generally those whose frontiers lie openest to the inroads\r\nof temptation, whose atmosphere is most subject to moody changes and\r\npassionate convulsions, who, while perhaps they can whisper laws\r\nto a hemisphere, can utter no decree of smallest potency as to how\r\nthings shall be within themselves. Place Alexander ille Magnus beside\r\nMalcolm\u2019s friend Epictetus, ille servorum servus; take his crutch\r\nfrom the slave and set the hero upon his Bucephalus--but set them\r\nalone and in a desert: which will prove the great man? which the\r\nunchangeable? The question being what the man himself shall or shall\r\nnot be, shall or shall not feel, shall or shall not recognize as of\r\nhimself and troubling the motions of his being, Alexander will prove a\r\nmere earth-bubble, Epictetus a cavern in which pulses the tide of the\r\neternal and infinite Sea.\r\n\r\nBut then first, when the false strength of the self-imagined great man\r\nis gone, when the want or the sickness has weakened the self-assertion\r\nwhich is so often mistaken for strength of individuality, when the\r\noccupations in which he formerly found a comfortable consciousness\r\nof being have lost their interest, his ambitions their glow, and his\r\nconsolations their colour, when suffering has wasted away those upper\r\nstrata of his factitious consciousness, and laid bare the lower,\r\nsimpler, truer deeps, of which he has never known or has forgotten\r\nthe existence, then there is a hope of his commencing a new and real\r\nlife. Powers then, even powers within himself of which he knew nothing,\r\nbegin to assert themselves, and the man commonly reported to possess a\r\nstrong will, is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.\r\nThis factor, this man of business, this despiser of humbug, to whom\r\nthe scruples of a sensitive conscience were a contempt, would now lie\r\nawake in the night and weep. \u201CAh!\u201D I hear it answered, \u201Cbut that was\r\nthe weakness caused by his illness.\u201D True: but what then had become\r\nof his strength? And was it all weakness? What if this weakness was\r\nitself a sign of returning life, not of advancing death--of the dawn\r\nof a new and genuine strength! For he wept because, in the visions of\r\nhis troubled brain, he saw once more the cottage of his father the\r\nshepherd, with all its store of lovely nothings round which the nimbus\r\nof sanctity had gathered while he thought not of them; wept over the\r\nmemory of that moment of delight when his mother kissed him for parting\r\nwith his willow whistle to the sister who cried for it: he cried now in\r\nhis turn, after five and fifty years, for not yet had the little fact\r\ndone with him, not yet had the kiss of his mother lost its power on the\r\nman: wept over the sale of the pet-lamb, though he had himself sold\r\nthousands of lambs, since; wept over even that bush of dusty miller\r\nby the door, like the one he trampled under his horse\u2019s feet in the\r\nlittle yard at Scaurnose that horrible day. And oh, that nest of wild\r\nbees with its combs of honey unspeakable! He used to laugh and sing\r\nthen: he laughed still sometimes--he could hear how he laughed, and\r\nit sounded frightful--but he never sang! Were the tears that honoured\r\nsuch childish memories all of weakness? Was it cause of regret that he\r\nhad not been wicked enough to have become impregnable to such foolish\r\ntrifles? Unable to mount a horse, unable to give an order, not caring\r\neven for his toddy, he was left at the mercy of his fundamentals; his\r\nchildhood came up and claimed him, and he found the childish things\r\nhe had put away better than the manly things he had adopted. It is\r\none thing for St Paul and another for Mr Worldly Wiseman to put away\r\nchildish things. The ways they do it, and the things they substitute,\r\nare both so different. And now first to me, whose weakness it is to\r\nlove life more than manners, and men more than their portraits, the man\r\nbegins to grow interesting. Picture the dawn of innocence on a dull,\r\nwhisky-drinking, common-place soul, stained by self-indulgence, and\r\ndistorted by injustice! Unspeakably more interesting and lovely is to\r\nme such a dawn than the honeymoon of the most passionate of lovers,\r\nexcept indeed I know them such lovers that their love will outlast all\r\nthe moons.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m a poor creature, Lizzy,\u201D he said, turning his heavy face one\r\nmidnight towards the girl, as she sat half-dozing, ready to start awake.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod comfort ye, sir!\u201D said the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019ll take good care of that!\u201D returned the factor. \u201CWhat did I ever\r\ndo to deserve it?--There\u2019s that MacPhail, now--to think of _him_!\r\nDidn\u2019t I do what man could for him? Didn\u2019t I keep him about the place\r\nwhen all the rest were dismissed? Didn\u2019t I give him the key of the\r\nlibrary, that he might read and improve his mind? And look what comes\r\nof it!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYe mean, sir,\u201D said Lizzy, quite innocently, \u201C\u2019at that\u2019s the w\u2019y ye\r\nha\u2019e dune wi\u2019 God, an\u2019 sae he winna heed ye?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe factor had meant nothing in the least like it. He had merely been\r\ntalking as the imps of suggestion tossed up. His logic was as sick and\r\nhelpless as himself. So at that he held his peace-- stung in his pride\r\nat least--perhaps in his conscience too, only he was not prepared to be\r\nrebuked by a girl like her, who had---- Well, he must let it pass: how\r\nmuch better was he himself?\r\n\r\nBut Lizzy was loyal: she could not hear him speak so of Malcolm and\r\nhold her peace as if she agreed in his condemnation.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe\u2019ll ken Ma\u2019colm better some day, sir,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, Lizzy,\u201D returned the sick man, in a tone that but for feebleness\r\nwould have been indignant, \u201CI have heard a good deal of the way women\r\n_will_ stand up for men that have treated them cruelly, but you to\r\nstand up for _him_ passes!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s been the best friend I ever had,\u201D said Lizzy.\r\n\r\n\u201CGirl! how can you sit there, and tell me so to my face?\u201D cried the\r\nfactor, his voice strengthened by the righteousness of the reproof it\r\nbore. \u201CIf it were not the dead of the night----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI tell ye naething but the trowth, sir,\u201D said Lizzy, as the contingent\r\nthreat died away. \u201CBut ye maun lie still or I maun gang for the\r\nmistress. Gien ye be the waur the morn, it\u2019ll be a\u2019 my wyte, \u2019cause I\r\ncudna bide to hear sic things said o\u2019 Ma\u2019colm.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you mean to tell me,\u201D persisted her charge, heedless of her\r\nexpostulation, \u201Cthat the fellow who brought you to disgrace, and left\r\nyou with a child you could ill provide for--and I well know never sent\r\nyou a penny all the time he was away, whatever he may have done now--is\r\nthe best friend you ever had?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNoo God forgi\u2019e ye, Maister Craithie, for threepin\u2019 sic a thing!\u201D\r\ncried Lizzy, rising as if she would leave him; \u201CMa\u2019colm MacPhail\u2019s as\r\nclear o\u2019 ony sin like mine as my wee bairnie itsel\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo ye daur tell me he\u2019s no the father o\u2019 that same, lass?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C_No_, nor never will be the father o\u2019 ony bairn whase mither\u2019s no his\r\nwife!\u201D said Lizzy, with burning cheeks and resolute voice.\r\n\r\nThe factor, who had risen on his elbow to look her in the face, fell\r\nback in silence; and neither of them spoke for what seemed to the\r\nwatcher a long time. When she ventured to look at him, he was asleep.\r\n\r\nHe lay in one of those troubled slumbers into which weakness and\r\nexhaustion will sometimes pass very suddenly; and in that slumber he\r\nhad a dream which he never forgot. He thought he had risen from his\r\ngrave with an awful sound in his ears, and knew he was wanted at the\r\njudgment seat. But he did not want to go, therefore crept into the\r\nporch of the church, and hoped to be forgotten. But suddenly an angel\r\nappeared with a flaming sword and drove him out of the churchyard away\r\nto Scaurnose where the judge was sitting. And as he fled in terror\r\nbefore the angel, he fell, and the angel came and stood over him, and\r\nhis sword flashed torture into his bones, but he could not and dared\r\nnot rise. At last, summoning all his strength, he looked up at him, and\r\ncried out, \u201CSir, ha\u2019e mercy, for God\u2019s sake.\u201D Instantly all the flames\r\ndrew back into the sword, and the blade dropped, burning like a brand,\r\nfrom the hilt, which the angel threw away.--And lo! it was Malcolm\r\nMacPhail, and he was stooping to raise him. With that he awoke, and\r\nthere was Lizzy looking down on him anxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat are you looking like that for?\u201D he asked crossly.\r\n\r\nShe did not like to tell him that she had been alarmed by his dropping\r\nasleep: and in her confusion she fell back on the last subject.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere maun be some mistak, Mr Craithie,\u201D she said. \u201CI wuss ye wad tell\r\nme what gars ye hate Ma\u2019colm MacPhail as ye du.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe factor, although he seemed to himself to know well enough, was yet\r\na little puzzled how to commence his reply; and therewith a process\r\nbegan that presently turned into something with which never in his life\r\nbefore had his inward parts been acquainted--a sort of self-examination\r\nto wit. He said to himself, partly in the desire to justify his present\r\ndislike--he would not call it hate, as Lizzy did--that he used to\r\nget on with the lad well enough, and had never taken offence at his\r\nfreedoms, making no doubt his manner came of his blood, and he could\r\nnot help it, being a chip of the old block; but when he ran away with\r\nthe marquis\u2019s boat, and went to the marchioness and told her lies\r\nagainst him--then what could he do but dislike him?\r\n\r\nArrived at this point, he opened his mouth and gave the substance of\r\nwhat preceded it for answer to Lizzy\u2019s question. But she replied at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\u201CNobody \u2019ill gar me believe, sir, \u2019at Ma\u2019colm MacPhail ever tellt a lee\r\nagain\u2019 you or onybody. I dinna believe he ever tellt a lee in \u2019s life.\r\nJist ye exem\u2019 him weel anent it, sir. An\u2019 for the boat, nae doobt it\r\nwas makin\u2019 free to tak it; but ye ken, sir, \u2019at hoo he was maister o\u2019\r\nthe same. It was in his chairge, an\u2019 ye ken little aboot boats yersel\u2019,\r\nor the sailin\u2019 o\u2019 them, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut it was me that engaged him again, after all the servants at the\r\nHouse had been dismissed: he was _my_ servant.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat maks the thing luik waur, nae doobt,\u201D allowed Lizzy, with\r\nsomething of cunning. \u201CHoo was \u2019t \u2019at he cam to du \u2019t ava\u2019 (_of all; at\r\nall_), sir? Can ye min\u2019?\u201D she pursued.\r\n\r\n\u201CI discharged him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAn\u2019 what for, gien I may mak bold to speir, sir?\u201D she went on.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor insolence.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWad ye tell me hoo he answert ye? Dinna think me meddlin\u2019, sir. I\u2019m\r\nclear certain there\u2019s been some mistak. Ye cudna be sae guid to me, an\u2019\r\nbe ill to him, ohn some mistak.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was consoling to the conscience of the factor, in regard of his\r\nbehaviour to the two women, to hear his own praise for kindness\r\nfrom a woman\u2019s lips. He took no offence therefore at her persistent\r\nquestioning, but told her as well and as truly as he could remember,\r\nwith no more than the all but unavoidable exaggeration with which\r\nfeeling _will_ colour fact, the whole passage between Malcolm and\r\nhimself concerning the sale of Kelpie, and closed with an appeal to\r\nthe judgment of his listener, in which he confidently anticipated her\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\n\u201CA most ridic\u2019lous thing! ye can see yersel\u2019 as weel \u2019s onybody, Lizzy!\r\nAn\u2019 sic a thing to ca\u2019 an honest man like mysel\u2019 a hypocrete for! ha!\r\nha! ha!

I\u2019ll no say it\u2019s jist allooable\r\nto tell a doonricht lee, but ye may come full nearer till \u2019t in\r\nhorse-dealin\u2019, ohn sinned, nor in ony ither kin\u2019 o\u2019 merchandeze. It\u2019s\r\nlike luve an\u2019 war, in baith which, it\u2019s weel kenned, a\u2019 thing\u2019s fair.\r\nThe saw sud rin--_Luve an\u2019 war an\u2019 horse dealin\u2019_.--Divna ye see,\r\nLizzy?\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Lizzy did not answer, and the factor, hearing a stifled sob,\r\nstarted to his elbow.\r\n\r\n\u201CLie still, sir,\u201D said Lizzy. \u201CIt\u2019s naething. I was only jist thinkin\u2019\r\n\u2019at that wad be the w\u2019y \u2019at the father o\u2019 my bairn rizoned wi\u2019 himsel\u2019\r\nwhan he lee\u2019d to me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHey!\u201D said the astonished factor, and in his turn held his peace,\r\ntrying to think.\r\n\r\nNow Lizzy, for the last few months, had been going to school, the same\r\nschool with Malcolm, open to all comers, the only school where one\r\nis sure to be led in the direction of wisdom, and there she had been\r\nlearning to some purpose--as plainly appeared before she had done with\r\nthe factor.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhase kirk are ye elder o\u2019, Maister Craithie?\u201D she asked presently.\r\n\r\n\u201COw, the kirk o\u2019 Scotlan\u2019, of coorse!\u201D answered the patient, in some\r\nsurprise at her ignorance.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, ay,\u201D returned Lizzy; \u201Cbut whase aucht (_owning, property_) is \u2019t?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COw, whase but the Redeemer\u2019s!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAn\u2019 div ye think, Mr Craithie, \u2019at gien Jesus Christ had had a horse\r\nto sell, he wad ha\u2019e hidden frae him \u2019at wad buy, ae hair a fau\u2019t \u2019at\r\nthe beast hed? Wad he no ha\u2019e dune till \u2019s neiper as he wad ha\u2019e his\r\nneiper du to him?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLassie! lassie! tak care hoo ye even _him_ to sic like as hiz (_us_).\r\nWhat wad _he_ hae to du wi\u2019 horse-flesh?\u201D\r\n\r\nLizzy held her peace. Here was no room for argument. He had flung the\r\ndoor of his conscience in the face of her who woke it. But it was too\r\nlate, for the word was in already. Oh! that false reverence which\r\nmen substitute for adoring obedience, and wherewith they reprove the\r\nchildlike spirit that does not know another kingdom than that of God\r\nand that of Mammon! God never gave man thing to do concerning which it\r\nwere irreverent to ponder how the son of God would have done it.\r\n\r\nBut, I say, the word was in, and, partly no doubt from its following so\r\nclose upon the dream the factor had had, was potent in its operation.\r\nHe fell a-thinking, and a-thinking more honestly than he had thought\r\nfor many a day. And presently it was revealed to him that, if he were\r\nin the horse market wanting to buy, and a man there who had to sell\r\nsaid to him--\u201CHe wadna du for you, sir; ye wad be tired o\u2019 \u2019im in a\r\nweek,\u201D he would never remark, \u201CWhat a fool the fellow is!\u201D but--\u201CWeel\r\nnoo, I ca\u2019 that neibourly!\u201D He did not get quite so far just then as to\r\nsee that every man to whom he might want to sell a horse was as much\r\nhis neighbour as his own brother; nor, indeed, if he had got as far,\r\nwould it have indicated much progress in honesty, seeing he would at\r\nany time, when needful and possible, have cheated that brother in the\r\nmatter of a horse, as certainly as he would a Patagonian or a Chinaman.\r\nBut the warped glass of a bad maxim had at least been cracked in his\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nThe peacemaker sat in silence the rest of the night, but the factor\u2019s\r\nsleep was broken, and at times he wandered. He was not so well the next\r\nday, and his wife, gathering that Lizzy had been talking, and herself\r\nfeeling better, would not allow her to sit up with him any more.\r\n\r\nDays and days passed, and still Malcolm had no word from Lenorme, and\r\nwas getting hopeless in respect of that quarter of possible aid. But\r\nso long as Florimel could content herself with the quiet of Lossie\r\nHouse, there was time to wait, he said to himself. She was not idle,\r\nand that was promising. Every day she rode out with Stoat. Now and then\r\nshe would make a call in the neighbourhood, and, apparently to trouble\r\nMalcolm, took care to let him know that on one of these occasions\r\nher call had been upon Mrs Stewart. One thing he did feel was that\r\nshe made no renewal of her friendship with his grandfather: she had,\r\nalas! outgrown the girlish fancy. Poor Duncan took it much to heart.\r\nShe saw more of the minister and his wife, who both flattered her,\r\nthan anybody else, and was expecting the arrival of Lady Bellair and\r\nLord Liftore with the utmost impatience. They, for their part, were\r\nmaking the journey by the easiest possible stages, tacking and veering,\r\nand visiting everyone of their friends that lay between London and\r\nLossie: they thought to give Florimel the little lesson, that, though\r\nthey accepted her invitation, they had plenty of friends in the world\r\nbesides her ladyship, and were not dying to see her.\r\n\r\nOne evening, Malcolm, as he left the grounds of Mr Morrison, on whom he\r\nhad been calling, saw a travelling carriage pass towards Portlossie;\r\nand something liker fear laid hold of his heart than he had ever felt\r\nexcept when Florimel and he on the night of the storm took her father\r\nfor Lord Gernon the wizard. As soon as he reached certain available\r\nfields, he sent Kelpie tearing across them, dodged through a fir-wood,\r\nand came out on the road half a mile in front of the carriage: as again\r\nit passed him he saw that his fears were facts, for in it sat the\r\nbold-faced countess, and the mean-hearted lord. Something _must_ be\r\ndone at last, and until it was done good watch must be kept.\r\n\r\nI must here note that, during this time of hoping and waiting, Malcolm\r\nhad attended to another matter of importance. Over every element\r\ninfluencing his life, his family, his dependents, his property, he\r\ndesired to possess a lawful, honest command: where he had to render\r\naccount, he would be head. Therefore, through Mr Soutar\u2019s London agent,\r\nto whom he sent up Davy, and whom he brought acquainted with Merton,\r\nand his former landlady at the curiosity shop, he had discovered a\r\ngood deal about Mrs Catanach from her London associates, among them\r\nthe herb-doctor, and his little boy who had watched Davy, and he had\r\nnow almost completed an outline of evidence, which, grounded on that\r\nof Rose, might be used against Mrs Catanach at any moment. He had also\r\nset inquiries on foot in the track of Caley\u2019s antecedents, and had\r\ndiscovered more than the acquaintance between her and Mrs Catanach.\r\nAlso he had arranged that Hodges, the man who had lost his leg through\r\nhis cruelty to Kelpie, should leave for Duff Harbour as soon as\r\npossible after his discharge from the hospital. He was determined to\r\ncrush the evil powers which had been ravaging his little world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nAN OFFERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nClementina was always ready to accord any reasonable request Florimel\r\ncould make of her; but her letter lifted such a weight from her heart\r\nand life that she would now have done whatever she desired, reasonable\r\nor unreasonable, provided only it was honest. She had no difficulty in\r\naccepting Florimel\u2019s explanation that her sudden disappearance was but\r\na breaking of the social gaol, the flight of the weary bird from its\r\nforeign cage back to the country of its nest; and that same morning she\r\ncalled upon Demon. The hound, feared and neglected, was rejoiced to see\r\nher, came when she called him, and received her caresses: there was\r\nno ground for dreading his company. It was a long journey, but if it\r\nhad been across a desert instead of through her own country, the hope\r\nthat lay at the end of it would have made it more than pleasant. She,\r\nas well as Lady Bellair, had friends upon the way, but no desire to\r\nlengthen the journey or shorten its tedium by visiting them.\r\n\r\nThe letter would have found her at Wastbeach instead of London, had not\r\nthe society and instructions of the schoolmaster detained her a willing\r\nprisoner to its heat and glare and dust. Him only in all London must\r\nshe see to bid good-bye. To Camden Town therefore she went that same\r\nevening, when his work would be over for the day. As usual now, she was\r\nshown into his room--his only one. As usual also, she found him poring\r\nover his Greek Testament. The gracious, graceful woman looked lovelily\r\nstrange in that mean chamber--like an opal in a brass ring. There was\r\nno such contrast between the room and its occupant. His bodily presence\r\nwas too weak to \u201Cstick fiery off\u201D from its surroundings, and to the\r\neye that saw through the bodily presence to the inherent grandeur,\r\nthat grandeur suggested no discrepancy, being of the kind that lifts\r\neverything to its own level, casts the mantle of its own radiance\r\naround its surroundings. Still to the eye of love and reverence it was\r\nnot pleasant to see him in such _entourage_, and now that Clementina\r\nwas going to leave him, the ministering spirit that dwelt in the woman\r\nwas troubled.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D he said, and rose as she entered; \u201Cthis is then the angel of my\r\ndeliverance!\u201D But with such a smile he did not look as if he had much\r\nto be delivered from. \u201CYou see,\u201D he went on, \u201Cold man as I am, and\r\npeaceful, the summer will lay hold upon me. She stretches out a long\r\narm into this desert of houses and stones, and sets me longing after\r\nthe green fields and the living air--it seems dead here--and the face\r\nof God--as much as one may behold of the Infinite through the revealing\r\nveil of earth and sky and sea. Shall I confess my weakness, my poverty\r\nof spirit, my covetousness after the visual? I was even getting a\r\nlittle tired of that glorious God-and-man-lover, Saul of Tarsus--no,\r\nnot of him, never of _him_, only of his shadow in his words. Yet\r\nperhaps--yes, I think so--it is God alone of whom a man can never get\r\ntired. Well, no matter; tired I was; when lo! here comes my pupil, with\r\nmore of God in her face than all the worlds and their skies he ever\r\nmade!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI would my heart were as full of him, too, then, sir!\u201D answered\r\nClementina. \u201CBut if I am anything of a comfort to you, I am more than\r\nglad,--therefore the more sorry to tell you that I am going to leave\r\nyou--though for a little while only, I trust.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou do not take me by surprise, my lady. I have of course been looking\r\nforward for some time to my loss and your gain. The world is full of\r\nlittle deaths--deaths of all sorts and sizes, rather let me say. For\r\nthis one I was prepared. The good summer land calls you to its bosom,\r\nand you must go.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCome with me,\u201D cried Clementina, her eyes eager with the light of the\r\nsudden thought, while her heart reproached her grievously that only now\r\nfirst had it come to her.\r\n\r\n\u201CA man must not leave the most irksome work for the most peaceful\r\npleasure,\u201D answered the schoolmaster. \u201CI am able to live--yes, and do\r\nmy work, without you, my lady,\u201D he added with a smile, \u201Cthough I shall\r\nmiss you sorely.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you do not know where I want you to come,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat difference can that make, my lady, except indeed in the amount of\r\npleasure to be refused, seeing this is not a matter of choice? I must\r\nbe with the children whom I have engaged to teach, and whose parents\r\npay me for my labour--not with those who, besides, can do well without\r\nme.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot, sir--not for long, at least.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat! not with Malcolm to supply my place?\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina blushed, but only like a white rose. She did not turn her\r\nhead aside; she did not lower their lids to veil the light she felt\r\nmount into her eyes; she looked him gently in the face as before, and\r\nher aspect of entreaty did not change.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! do not be unkind, master,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CUnkind!\u201D he repeated. \u201CYou know I am not. I have more kindness in my\r\nheart than my lips can tell. You do not know, you could not yet imagine\r\nthe half of what I hope of and for and from you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI _am_ going to see Malcolm,\u201D she said, with a little sigh. \u201CThat is,\r\nI am going to visit Lady Lossie at her place in Scotland-- your own\r\nold home, where so many must love you.--_Can\u2019t_ you come? I shall be\r\ntravelling alone, quite alone, except my servants.\u201D\r\n\r\nA shadow came over the schoolmaster\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou do not _think_, my lady, or you would not press me. It pains me\r\nthat you do not see at once it would be dishonest to go without timely\r\nnotice to my pupils, and to the public too. But, beyond that quite,\r\nI never do anything of myself. I go, not where I wish, but where I\r\nseem to be called or sent. I never even wish much--except when I pray\r\nto him in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.\r\nAfter what he wants to give me I am wishing all day long. I used to\r\nbuild many castles, not without a beauty of their own--that was when\r\nI had less understanding: now I leave them to God to build for me--he\r\ndoes it better, and they last longer. See now, this very hour, when I\r\nneeded help--could I have contrived a more lovely annihilation of the\r\nmonotony that threatened to invade my weary spirit, than this inroad\r\nof light in the person of my lady Clementina? Nor will he allow me to\r\nget over-wearied with vain efforts. I do not think he will keep me here\r\nlong, for I find I cannot do much for these children. They are but\r\nsome of his many pagans--not yet quite ready to receive Christianity,\r\nI think-- not like children with some of the old seeds of the truth\r\nburied in them, that want to be turned up nearer to the light. This\r\nministration I take to be more for my good than theirs--a little trial\r\nof faith and patience for me--a stony corner of the lovely valley of\r\nhumiliation to cross. True, I _might_ be happier where I could hear the\r\nlarks, but I do not know that anywhere have I been more peaceful than\r\nin this little room, on which I see you so often cast round your eyes\r\ncuriously--perhaps pitifully, my lady?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is not at all a fit place for _you_,\u201D said Clementina, with a touch\r\nof indignation.\r\n\r\n\u201CSoftly, my lady--lest, without knowing it, your love should make\r\nyou sin! Who set thee, I pray, for a guardian angel over my welfare?\r\nI could scarce have a lovelier--true! but where is thy brevet? No,\r\nmy lady! it is a greater than thou that sets me the bounds of my\r\nhabitation. Perhaps he may give me a palace one day. If I might choose,\r\nit would be the things that belong to a cottage --the whiteness and\r\nthe greenness and the sweet odours of cleanliness. But the father has\r\ndecreed for his children that they shall know the thing that is neither\r\ntheir ideal nor his. Who can imagine how in this respect things looked\r\nto our Lord when he came and found so little faith on the earth! But,\r\nperhaps, my lady, you would not pity my present condition so much, if\r\nyou had seen the cottage in which I was born, and where my father and\r\nmy mother loved each other, and died happier than on their wedding day.\r\nThere I was happy too until their loving ambition decreed that I should\r\nbe a scholar and a clergyman. Not before then did I ever know anything\r\nworthy of the name of trouble. A little cold and a little hunger at\r\ntimes, and not a little restlessness always was all. But then --ah\r\nthen, my troubles began! Yet God, who bringeth light out of darkness,\r\nhath brought good even out of my weakness and presumption and half\r\nunconscious falsehood!--When do you go?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTo-morrow morning--as I purpose.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen God be with thee. He _is_ with thee, only my prayer is that thou\r\nmayest know it. He is with me and I know it. He does not find this\r\nchamber too mean or dingy or unclean to let me know him near me in it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTell me one thing before I go,\u201D said Clementina: \u201Care we not commanded\r\nto bear each other\u2019s burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ? I read it\r\nto-day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen why ask me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFor another question: does not that involve the command to those who\r\nhave burdens that they should allow others to bear them?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSurely, my lady. But _I_ have no burden to let you bear.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy should I have everything, and you nothing?--Answer me that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady, I have millions more than you, for I have been gathering the\r\ncrumbs under my master\u2019s table for thirty years.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are a king,\u201D answered Clementina. \u201CBut a king needs a handmaiden\r\nsomewhere in his house: that let _me_ be in yours. No, I will be proud,\r\nand assert my rights. I am your daughter. If I am not, why am I here?\r\nDo you not remember telling me that the adoption of God meant a closer\r\nrelation than any other fatherhood, even his own first fatherhood could\r\nsignify? You cannot cast me off if you would. Why should you be poor\r\nwhen I am rich?--You _are_ poor. You cannot deny it,\u201D she concluded\r\nwith a serious playfulness.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will not deny my privileges,\u201D said the schoolmaster, with a smile\r\nsuch as might have acknowledged the possession of some exquisite and\r\nenvied rarity.\r\n\r\n\u201CI believe,\u201D insisted Clementina, \u201Cyou are just as poor as the apostle\r\nPaul when he sat down to make a tent--or as our Lord himself after he\r\ngave up carpentering.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are wrong there, my lady. I am not so poor as they must often have\r\nbeen.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I don\u2019t know how long I may be away, and you may fall ill,\r\nor--or--see some--some book you want very much, or----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI never do,\u201D said the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat! never see a book you want to have?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; not now. I have my Greek Testament, my Plato, and my Shakspere\r\n--and one or two little books besides, whose wisdom I have not yet\r\nquite exhausted.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t bear it!\u201D cried Clementina, almost on the point of weeping.\r\n\u201CYou will not let me near you. You put out an arm as long as the\r\nsummer\u2019s and push me away from you. _Let_ me be your servant.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, she rose, and walking softly up to him where he sat\r\nkneeled at his knees, held out suppliantly a little bag of white silk,\r\ntied with crimson.\r\n\r\n\u201CTake it--father,\u201D she said, hesitating, and bringing the word out with\r\nan effort; \u201Ctake your daughter\u2019s offering--a poor thing to show her\r\nlove, but something to ease her heart.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe took it, and weighed it up and down in his hand with an amused\r\nsmile, but his eyes full of tears. It was heavy. He opened it. A chair\r\nwas within his reach, he emptied it on the seat of it, and laughed with\r\nmerry delight as its contents came tumbling out.\r\n\r\n\u201CI never saw so much gold in my life, if it were all taken together,\u201D\r\nhe said. \u201CWhat beautiful stuff it is! But I don\u2019t want it, my dear. It\r\nwould but trouble me.\u201D And as he spoke, he began to put it in the bag\r\nagain. \u201CYou will want it for your journey,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have plenty in my reticule,\u201D she answered. \u201CThat is a mere nothing\r\nto what I could have to-morrow morning for writing a cheque. I am\r\nafraid I am very rich. It is such a shame! But I can\u2019t well help it.\r\nYou must teach me how to become poor.--Tell me true: how much money\r\nhave you?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe said this with such an earnest look of simple love that the\r\nschoolmaster made haste to rise, that he might conceal his growing\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n\u201CRise, my dear lady,\u201D he said, as he rose himself, \u201Cand I will show\r\nyou.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe gave her his hand, and she obeyed, but troubled and disappointed,\r\nand so stood looking after him, while he went to a drawer. Thence,\r\nsearching in a corner of it, he brought a half sovereign, a few\r\nshillings, and some coppers, and held them out to her on his hand, with\r\nthe smile of one who has proved his point.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere!\u201D he said; \u201Cdo you think Paul would have stopped preaching to\r\nmake a tent so long as he had as much as that in his pocket? I shall\r\nhave more on Saturday, and I always carry a month\u2019s rent in my good old\r\nwatch, for which I never had much use, and now have less than ever.\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina had been struggling with herself; now she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, what a misspending of precious sorrow!\u201D exclaimed the\r\nschoolmaster. \u201CDo you think because a man has not a gold mine he must\r\ndie of hunger? I once heard of a sparrow that never had a worm left for\r\nthe morrow, and died a happy death notwithstanding.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he took her handkerchief from her hand and dried her tears\r\nwith it. But he had enough ado to keep his own back.\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause I won\u2019t take a bagful of gold from you when I don\u2019t want it,\u201D\r\nhe went on, \u201Cdo you think I should let myself starve without coming\r\nto you? I promise you I will let you know--come to you if I can, the\r\nmoment I get too hungry to do my work well, and have no money left.\r\nShould I think it a disgrace to take money from _you_? That would show\r\na poverty of spirit such as I hope never to fall into. My _sole_ reason\r\nfor refusing it now is that I do not need it.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut for all his loving words and assurances Clementina could not stay\r\nher tears. She was not ready to weep, but now her eyes were as a\r\nfountain.\r\n\r\n\u201CSee, then, for your tears are hard to bear, my daughter,\u201D he said, \u201CI\r\nwill take one of these golden ministers, and if it has flown from me\r\nere you come, seeing that, like the raven, it will not return if once I\r\nlet it go, I will ask you for another. It _may_ be God\u2019s will that you\r\nshould feed me for a time.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLike one of Elijah\u2019s ravens,\u201D said Clementina, with an attempted laugh\r\nthat was really a sob.\r\n\r\n\u201CLike a dove whose wings are covered with silver, and her feathers with\r\nyellow gold,\u201D said the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nA moment of silence followed, broken only by Clementina\u2019s failures in\r\nquieting herself.\r\n\r\n\u201CTo me,\u201D he resumed, \u201Cthe sweetest fountain of money is the hand of\r\nlove, but a man has no right to take it from that fountain except he is\r\nin want of it. I am not. True, I go somewhat bare, my lady; but what is\r\nthat when my Lord would have it so?\u201D\r\n\r\nHe opened again the bag, and slowly, reverentially indeed, drew from it\r\none of the new sovereigns with which it was filled. He put it into a\r\nwaistcoat pocket, and laid the bag on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut your clothes are shabby, sir,\u201D said Clementina, looking at him\r\nwith a sad little shake of the head.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre they?\u201D he returned, and looked down at his lower garments,\r\nreddening and anxious. \u201C--I did not think they were more than a little\r\nrubbed, but they shine somewhat,\u201D he said. \u201C--They are indeed polished\r\nby use,\u201D he went on, with a troubled little laugh; \u201Cbut they have no\r\nholes yet--at least none that are visible,\u201D he corrected. \u201CIf you tell\r\nme, my lady, if you honestly tell me that my garments\u201D--and he looked\r\nat the sleeve of his coat, drawing back his head from it to see it\r\nbetter--\u201Care unsightly, I will take of your money and buy me a new\r\nsuit.\u201D\r\n\r\nOver his coat-sleeve he regarded her, questioning.\r\n\r\n\u201CEverything about you is beautiful!\u201D she burst out. \u201CYou want nothing\r\nbut a body that lets the light through!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe took the hand still raised in his survey of his sleeve, pressed it\r\nto her lips, and walked, with even more than her wonted state, slowly\r\nfrom the room. He took the bag of gold from the table, and followed her\r\ndown the stair. Her chariot was waiting her at the door. He handed her\r\nin, and laid the bag on the little seat in front.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you tell him to drive home,\u201D she said, with a firm voice, and\r\na smile which if anyone care to understand, let him read Spenser\u2019s\r\nfortieth sonnet. And so they parted. The coachman took the queer shabby\r\nun-London-like man for a fortune-teller his lady was in the habit of\r\nconsulting, and paid homage to his power with the handle of his whip as\r\nhe drove away. The schoolmaster returned to his room, not to his Plato,\r\nnot even to Saul of Tarsus, but to the Lord himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nTHOUGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Malcolm took Kelpie to her stall the night of the arrival of\r\nLady Bellair and her nephew, he was rushed upon by Demon, and nearly\r\nprostrated between his immoderate welcome and the startled rearing of\r\nthe mare. The hound had arrived a couple of hours before, while Malcolm\r\nwas out. He wondered he had not seen him with the carriage he had\r\npassed, never suspecting he had had another conductress, or dreaming\r\nwhat his presence there signified for him.\r\n\r\nI have not said much concerning Malcolm\u2019s feelings with regard to Lady\r\nClementina, but all this time the sense of her existence had been like\r\nan atmosphere surrounding and pervading his thought. He saw in her the\r\npromise of all he could desire to see in woman. His love was not of\r\nthe blind-little-boy sort, but of a deeper, more exacting, keen-eyed\r\nkind, that sees faults where even a true mother will not, so jealous\r\nis it of the perfection of the beloved. But one thing was plain even\r\nto this seraphic dragon that dwelt sleepless in him, and there was\r\neternal content in the thought, that such a woman, once started on\r\nthe right way, would soon leave fault and weakness behind her, and\r\nbecome as one of the grand women of old, whose religion was simply what\r\nreligion is--life --neither more nor less than life. She would be a\r\nsaint without knowing it, the only grand kind of sainthood. Whoever can\r\nthink of religion as an addition to life, however glorious --a starry\r\ncrown, say, set upon the head of humanity--is not yet the least in the\r\nkingdom of heaven. Whoever thinks of life as a something that could be\r\nwithout religion, is in deathly ignorance of both. Life and religion\r\nare one, or neither is anything: I will not say neither is growing to\r\nbe anything. Religion is no way of life, no show of life, no observance\r\nof any sort. It is neither the food nor the medicine of being. It is\r\nlife essential. To think otherwise is as if a man should pride himself\r\non his honesty, or his parental kindness, or hold up his head amongst\r\nmen because he never killed one: were he less than honest or kind or\r\nfree from blood, he would yet think something of himself! The man to\r\nwhom virtue is but the ornament of character, something over and above,\r\nnot essential to it, is not yet a man.\r\n\r\nIf I say then, that Malcolm was always thinking about Lady Clementina\r\nwhen he was not thinking about something he _had_ to think about,\r\nhave I not said nearly enough on the matter? Should I ever dream of\r\nattempting to set forth what love is, in such a man for such a woman?\r\nThere are comparatively few that have more than the glimmer of a notion\r\nof what love means. God only knows how grandly, how passionately yet\r\nhow calmly, how divinely the man and the woman he has made, might, may,\r\nshall love each other. One thing only I will dare to say: that the love\r\nthat belonged to Malcolm\u2019s nature was one through the very nerves of\r\nwhich the love of God must rise and flow and return, as its essential\r\nlife. If any man think that such a love could no longer be the love of\r\nthe man for the woman, he knows his own nature, and that of the woman\r\nhe pretends or thinks he adores, but in the darkest of glasses.\r\n\r\nMalcolm\u2019s lowly idea of himself did not at all interfere with his\r\nloving Clementina, for at first his love was entirely dissociated from\r\nany thought of hers. When the idea--the mere idea of her loving him\r\npresented itself, from whatever quarter suggested, he turned from it\r\nwith shame and self-reproof: the thought was in its own nature too\r\nunfit! That splendour regard him!\r\n\r\nFrom a social point of view there was of course little presumption\r\nin it. The Marquis of Lossie bore a name that might pair itself with\r\nany in the land; but Malcolm did not yet feel that the title made\r\nmuch difference to the fisherman. He was what he was, and that was\r\nsomething very lowly indeed. Yet the thought would at times dawn up\r\nfrom somewhere in the infinite matrix of thought, that perhaps, if he\r\nwent to college, and graduated, and dressed like a gentleman, and did\r\neverything as gentlemen do, in short, claimed his rank, and lived as\r\na marquis should, as well as a fisherman might,--then --then--was it\r\nnot--might it not be within the bounds of possibility--just within\r\nthem--that the great hearted, generous, liberty-loving Lady Clementina,\r\ngroom as he had been, _menial_ as he had heard himself called, and\r\nas, ere yet he knew his birth, he had laughed to hear, knowing that\r\nhis service was true,--that she, who despised nothing human, would be\r\nneither disgusted nor contemptuous nor wrathful, if, from a great way\r\noff, at an awful remove of humility and worship, he were to wake in her\r\na surmise that he dared feel towards her as he had never felt and never\r\ncould feel towards any other? For would it not be altogether counter\r\nto the principles he had so often heard her announce and defend,\r\nto despise him because he had earned his bread by doing honourable\r\nwork--work hearty, and up to the worth of his wages? Was she one to\r\nsay and not see--to opine and not believe? or was she one to hold and\r\nnot practise-- to believe for the heart and not for the hand--to say\r\n_I go_, and not go--_I love_, and not help? If such she were, then\r\nthere were for him no further searchings of the heart upon her account;\r\nhe could but hold up her name in the common prayer for all men, only\r\npraying besides not to dream about her when he slept.\r\n\r\nAt length, such thoughts rising again and again, and ever accompanied\r\nby such reflections concerning the truth of her character, and by the\r\ngrowing certainty that her convictions were the souls of actions to\r\nbe born them, his daring of belief in her strengthened until he began\r\nto think that perhaps it would be neither his early history, nor his\r\ndefective education, nor his clumsiness, that would prevent her from\r\nlistening to such words wherewith he burned to throw open the gates of\r\nhis world, and pray her to enter and sit upon its loftiest throne--its\r\nloftiest throne but one. And with the thought he felt as if he must\r\nrun to her, calling aloud that he was the Marquis of Lossie, and throw\r\nhimself at her feet.\r\n\r\nBut the wheels of his thought-chariot, self-moved, were rushing, and\r\nhere was no goal at which to halt or turn!--for, feeling thus, where\r\nwas his faith in her principles? How now was he treating the truth\r\nof her nature? where now were his convictions of the genuineness\r\nof her professions? Where were those principles, that truth, those\r\nprofessions, if after all she would listen to a marquis and would not\r\nlisten to a groom? To suppose such a thing was to wrong her grievously.\r\nTo herald his suit with his rank would be to insult her, declaring that\r\nhe regarded her theories of humanity as wordy froth. And what a chance\r\nof proving her truth would he not deprive her of, if, as he approached\r\nher, he called on the marquis to supplement the man!--But what then was\r\nthe man, fisherman or marquis, to dare _even himself_ to such a glory\r\nas the Lady Clementina? --This much of a man at least, answered his\r\nwaking dignity, that he could not condescend to be accepted as Malcolm,\r\nMarquis of Lossie, knowing he would have been rejected as Malcolm\r\nMacPhail, fisherman and groom. Accepted as marquis, he would for ever\r\nbe haunted with the _channering_ question whether she would have\r\naccepted him as groom? And if in his pain he were one day to utter it,\r\nand she in her honesty were to confess she would not, must she not then\r\nfall prone from her pedestal in his imagination? Could he then, in love\r\nfor the woman herself condescend as marquis to marry one who _might_\r\nnot have married him as any something else he could honestly have been,\r\nunder the all enlightening sun?--Ah, but again! was that fair to her\r\nyet? Might she not see in the marquis the truth and worth which the\r\nblinding falsehoods of society prevented her from seeing in the groom?\r\nMight not a lady--he tried to think of a lady in the abstract-- might\r\nnot a lady, in marrying a marquis, a lady to whom from her own position\r\na marquis was just a man on the level, marry in him the man he was,\r\nand not the marquis he seemed? Most certainly, he answered: he must\r\nnot be unfair.--Not the less however did he shrink from the thought of\r\ntaking her prisoner under the shield of his marquisate, beclouding her\r\nnobility, and depriving her of the rare chance of shining forth as the\r\nsun in the splendour of womanly truth. No; he would choose the greater\r\nrisk of losing her, for the chance of winning her greater.\r\n\r\nSo far Malcolm got with his theories; but the moment he began to think\r\nin the least practically, he recoiled altogether from the presumption.\r\nUnder no circumstances could he ever have the courage to approach\r\nLady Clementina with a thought of himself in his mind. How could he\r\nhave dared even to raise her imagined eidolon for his thoughts to\r\ndeal withal! She had never shown him personal favour. He could not\r\ntell whether she had listened to what he had tried to lay before her.\r\nHe did not know that she had gone to hear his master; Florimel had\r\nnever referred to their visit to Hope Chapel; his surprise would have\r\nequalled his delight at the news that she had already become as a\r\ndaughter to the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nAnd what had been Clementina\u2019s thoughts since learning that Florimel\r\nhad not run away with her groom? It were hard to say with completeness.\r\nAccuracy however may not be equally unattainable. Her first feeling was\r\nan utterly inarticulate, undefined pleasure that Malcolm was free to be\r\nthought about. She was clear next that it would be matter for honest\r\nrejoicing if the truest man she had ever met except his master, was\r\nnot going to marry such an unreality as Florimel--one concerning whom,\r\nas things had been going of late, it was impossible to say that she\r\nwas not more likely to turn to evil than to good. Clementina with all\r\nher generosity could not help being doubtful of a woman who could make\r\na companion of such a man as Liftore, a man to whom every individual\r\nparticle of Clementina\u2019s nature seemed for itself to object. But she\r\nwas not yet past befriending.\r\n\r\nThen she began to grow more _curious_ about Malcolm. She had already\r\nmuch real knowledge of him, gathered both from himself and from Mr\r\nGraham;--as to what went to make the man, she knew him indeed, not\r\nthoroughly, but well; and just therefore, she said to herself, there\r\nwere some points in his history and condition concerning which she\r\nhad _curiosity_. The principal of these was whether he might not be\r\nengaged to some young woman in his own station of life. It was not\r\nmerely possible, but was it likely he could have escaped it? In the\r\nlower ranks of society, men married younger--they had no false aims\r\nto prevent them that implied earlier engagements. On the other hand,\r\nwas it likely that in a fishing village there would be any choice of\r\ngirls who could understand him when he talked about Plato and the New\r\nTestament? If there was _one_ however, that might be--_worse?_--Yes,\r\n_worse_; she accepted the word. Neither was it absolutely necessary\r\nin a wife that she should understand more of a husband than his\r\nheart. Many learned men had had mere housekeepers for wives, and been\r\nsatisfied, at least never complained. And what did she know about the\r\nfishers, men or women?--there were none at Wastbeach. For anything she\r\nknew to the contrary, they might all be philosophers together, and a\r\nfitting match for Malcolm might be far more easy to find amongst them\r\nthan in the society to which she herself belonged, where in truth the\r\nphilosophical element was rare enough. Then arose in her mind, she\r\ncould not have told how, the vision, half logical, half pictorial,\r\nof a whole family of brave, believing, daring, saving fisher-folk,\r\nfather, mother, boys and girls, each sacrificing to the rest, each\r\nsacrificed to by all, and all devoted to their neighbours. Grand it was\r\nand blissful, and the borders of the great sea alone seemed fit place\r\nfor such beings amphibious of time and eternity! Their very toils and\r\ndangers were but additional atmospheres to press their souls together!\r\nIt was glorious! Why had she been born an earl\u2019s daughter,--never to\r\nlook a danger in the face--never to have a chance of a true life--that\r\nis, a grand, simple, noble one?--Who then denied her the chance? Had\r\nshe _no_ power to order her own steps, to determine her own being?\r\nWas she nailed to her rank? Or who was there that could part her\r\nfrom it? Was she a prisoner in the dungeons of the House of Pride?\r\nWhen the gates of paradise closed behind Adam and Eve, they had this\r\nconsolation left, that \u201Cthe world was all before them where to choose.\u201D\r\nWas she not a free woman--without even a guardian to trouble her with\r\nadvice? She had no excuse to act ignobly!--But had she any for being\r\nunmaidenly?--Would it then be--would it be a _very_ unmaidenly thing\r\nif----? The rest of the sentence did not take even the shape of words.\r\nBut she answered it nevertheless in the words: \u201CNot so unmaidenly as\r\npresumptuous.\u201D And alas there was little hope that _he_ would ever\r\npresume to----? He was such a modest youth, with all his directness\r\nand fearlessness! If he had no respect for rank,--and that was--yes,\r\nshe would say the word, _hopeful_ --he had, on the other hand, the\r\nprofoundest respect for the human, and she could not tell how that\r\nmight, in the individual matter, operate.\r\n\r\nThen she fell a-thinking of the difference between Malcolm and any\r\nother servant she had ever known. She hated the _servile_. She knew\r\nthat it was false as well as low: she had not got so far as to see\r\nthat it was low through its being false. She knew that most servants,\r\nwhile they spoke with the appearance of respect in presence, altered\r\ntheir tone entirely when beyond the circle of the eye--theirs was\r\neye-service--they were men-pleasers--they were servile. She had\r\noverheard her maid speak of her as Lady Clem, and that not without\r\na streak of contempt in the tone. But here was a man who touched no\r\nimaginary hat while he stood in the presence of his mistress, neither\r\nswore at her in the stable-yard. He looked her straight in the face,\r\nand would upon occasion speak--not his _mind_--but the truth to her.\r\nEven his slight mistress had the conviction that if one dared in his\r\npresence but utter her name lightly, whoever he were he would have to\r\nanswer to him for it. What a lovely thing was true service!--Absolutely\r\ndivine! But, alas, such a youth would never, could never dare offer\r\nother than such service! Were she even to encourage him as a maiden\r\nmight, he would but serve her the better--would but embody his\r\nrecognition of her favour, in fervour of ministering devotion.-- Was\r\nit not a recognized law, however, in the relation of superiors and\r\ninferiors, that with regard to such matters as well as others of\r\nno moment, the lady--?----Ah, but! for her to take the initiative,\r\nwould provoke the conclusion --as revolting to her as unavoidable to\r\nhim--that she judged herself his superior--so greatly his superior as\r\nto be absolved from the necessity of behaving to him on the ordinary\r\nfooting of man and woman. What a ground to start from with a husband!\r\nThe idea was hateful to her. She tried the argument that such a\r\nprocedure arrogated merely a superiority in social standing; but it\r\nmade her recoil from it the more. He was so immeasurably her superior,\r\nthat the poor little advantage on her side vanished like a candle in\r\nthe sunlight, and she laughed herself to scorn. \u201CFancy,\u201D she laughed,\r\n\u201Ca midge, on the strength of having wings, condescending to offer\r\nmarriage to a horse!\u201D It would argue the assumption of equality in\r\nother and more important things than rank, or at least the confidence\r\nthat her social superiority not only counter-balanced the difference,\r\nbut left enough over to her credit to justify her initiative. And\r\nwhat a miserable fiction, that money and position had a right to\r\nthe first move before greatness of living fact! that _having_ had\r\nthe precedence of _being_! That Malcolm should imagine such _her_\r\njudgment--No--let all go-- let himself go rather! And then, he might\r\nnot choose to accept her munificent offer! Or worse--far worse!--what\r\nif he should be tempted by rank and wealth, and, accepting her, be\r\nshorn of his glory and proved of the ordinary human type after all! A\r\nthousand times rather would she see the bright particular star blazing\r\nunreachable above her! What! would she carry it about, a cinder in her\r\npocket?--And yet if he _could_ be \u201Cturned to a coal,\u201D why should she go\r\non worshipping him?--alas! the offer itself was the only test severe\r\nenough to try him withal, and if he proved a cinder, she would by the\r\nvery use of the test be bound to love, honour, and obey her cinder. She\r\ncould not well reject him for accepting her--neither could she marry\r\nhim if he rose grandly superior to her temptations. No; he could be\r\nnothing to her nearer than the bright particular star.\r\n\r\nThus went the thoughts to and fro in the minds of each. Neither could\r\nsee the way. Both feared the risk of loss. Neither could hope greatly\r\nfor gain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nTHE DUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving put Kelpie up, and fed and bedded her, Malcolm took his way to\r\nthe Seaton, full of busily anxious thought. Things had taken a bad\r\nturn, and he was worse off for counsel than before. The enemy was in\r\nthe house with his sister, and he had no longer any chance of judging\r\nhow matters were going, as now he never rode out with her. But at least\r\nhe could haunt the house. He would run therefore to his grandfather,\r\nand tell him that he was going to occupy his old quarters at the House\r\nthat night.\r\n\r\nReturning directly and passing, as had been his custom, through the\r\nkitchen to ascend the small corkscrew stair the servants generally\r\nused, he encountered Mrs Courthope, who told him that her ladyship had\r\ngiven orders that her maid, who had come with Lady Bellair, should have\r\nhis room. He was at once convinced that Florimel had done so with the\r\nintention of banishing him from the house, for there were dozens of\r\nrooms vacant, and many of them more suitable. It was a hard blow! How\r\nhe wished for Mr Graham to consult! And yet Mr Graham was not of much\r\nuse where any sort of plotting was wanted. He asked Mrs Courthope to\r\nlet him have another room; but she looked so doubtful that he withdrew\r\nhis request, and went back to his grandfather.\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday, and not many of the boats would go fishing. Findlay\u2019s\r\nwould not leave the harbour till Sunday was over, and therefore Malcolm\r\nwas free. But he could not rest, and would go line-fishing.\r\n\r\n\u201CDaddy,\u201D he said, \u201CI\u2019m gaein oot to catch a haddick or sae to oor\r\ndenner the morn. Ye micht jist sit doon upo\u2019 ane o\u2019 the Boar\u2019s Taes,\r\nan\u2019 tak a play o\u2019 yer pipes. I\u2019ll hear ye fine, an\u2019 it\u2019ll du me guid.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Boar\u2019s Toes were two or three small rocks that rose out of the sand\r\nnear the end of the dune. Duncan agreed right willingly, and Malcolm,\r\nborrowing some lines, and taking the Psyche\u2019s dinghy, rowed out into\r\nthe bay.\r\n\r\nThe sun was down, the moon was up, and he had caught more fish than he\r\nwanted. His grandfather had got tired, and gone home, and the fountain\r\nof his anxious thoughts began to flow more rapidly. He must go ashore.\r\nHe must go up to the House: who could tell what might not be going on\r\nthere? He drew in his line, purposing to take the best of the fish to\r\nMiss Horn, and some to Mrs Courthope, as in the old days.\r\n\r\nThe Psyche still lay on the sands, and he was rowing the dinghy towards\r\nher, when, looking round to direct his course, he thought he caught\r\na glimpse of some one seated on the slope of the dune. Yes, there\r\nwas some one there, sure enough. The old times rushed back on his\r\nmemory: could it be Florimel? Alas! it was not likely she would now be\r\nwandering about alone! But if it were? Then for one endeavour more to\r\nrouse her slumbering conscience! He would call up all the associations\r\nof the last few months she had spent in the place, and, with the spirit\r\nof her father, as it were, hovering over her, conjure her, in his name,\r\nto break with Liftore.\r\n\r\nHe rowed swiftly to the Psyche--beached and drew up the dinghy, and\r\nclimbed the dune. Plainly enough it was a lady who sat there. It might\r\nbe one from the upper town, enjoying the lovely night; it _might_ be\r\nFlorimel, but how could she have got away, or wished to get away from\r\nher newly arrived guests? The voices of several groups of walkers came\r\nfrom the high road behind the dune, but there was no other figure to be\r\nseen all along the sands. He drew nearer. The lady did not move. If it\r\nwere Florimel, would she not know him as he came, and would she wait\r\nfor him?\r\n\r\nHe drew nearer still. His heart gave a throb. Could it be? Or was the\r\nmoon weaving some hallucination in his troubled brain? If it was a\r\nphantom, it was that of Lady Clementina; if but modelled of the filmy\r\nvapours of the moonlight, and the artist his own brain, the phantom was\r\nwelcome as joy! His spirit seemed to soar aloft in the yellow air, and\r\nhang hovering over and around her, while his body stood rooted to the\r\nspot, like one who fears by moving nigher to lose the lovely vision of\r\na mirage. She sat motionless, her gaze on the sea. Malcolm bethought\r\nhimself that she could not know him in his fisher-dress, and must take\r\nhim for some rude fisherman staring at her. He must go at once, or\r\napproach and address her. He came forward at once.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady!\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nShe did not start. Neither did she speak. She did not even turn her\r\nface. She rose first, then turned, and held out her hand. Three steps\r\nmore, and he had it in his, and his eyes looked straight into hers.\r\nNeither spoke. The moon shone full on Clementina\u2019s face. There was no\r\nillumination fitter for that face than the moonlight, and to Malcolm it\r\nwas lovelier than ever. Nor was it any wonder it should seem so to him,\r\nfor certainly never had the eyes in it rested on his with such a lovely\r\nand trusting light in them.\r\n\r\nA moment she stood, then slowly sank upon the sand, and drew her skirts\r\nabout her with a dumb show of invitation. The place where she sat was a\r\nlittle terraced hollow in the slope, forming a convenient seat. Malcolm\r\nsaw but could not believe she actually made room for him to sit beside\r\nher--alone with her in the universe. It was too much; he dared not\r\nbelieve it. And now by one of those wondrous duplications which are not\r\nalways at least born of the fancy, the same scene in which he had found\r\nFlorimel thus seated on the slope of the dune, appeared to be passing\r\nagain through Malcolm\u2019s consciousness, only instead of Florimel was\r\nClementina, and instead of the sun was the moon. And creature of the\r\nsunlight as Florimel was, bright and gay and beautiful, she paled into\r\na creature of the cloud beside this maiden of the moonlight, tall and\r\nstately, silent and soft and grand.\r\n\r\nAgain she made a movement. This time he could not doubt her invitation.\r\nIt was as if her soul made room in her unseen world for him to enter\r\nand sit beside her. But who could enter heaven in his work-day garments?\r\n\r\n\u201CWon\u2019t you sit by me, Malcolm?\u201D seeing his more than hesitation, she\r\nsaid at last, with a slight tremble in the voice that was music itself\r\nin his ears.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have been catching fish, my lady,\u201D he answered, \u201Cand my clothes must\r\nbe unpleasant. I will sit here.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe went a little lower on the slope, and laid himself down, leaning on\r\nhis elbow.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo fresh water fishes smell the same as the sea-fishes, Malcolm?\u201D she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed I am not certain, my lady. Why?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause if they do,----You remember what you said to me as we passed\r\nthe saw-mill in the wood?\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was by silence Malcolm showed he did remember.\r\n\r\n\u201CDoes not this night remind you of that one at Wastbeach when we came\r\nupon you singing?\u201D said Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt _is_ like it, my lady--now. But a little ago, before I saw you, I\r\nwas thinking of that night, and thinking how different this was.\u201D\r\n\r\nAgain a moon-filled silence fell; and once more it was the lady who\r\nbroke it.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know who are at the house?\u201D she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do, my lady,\u201D he replied.\r\n\r\n\u201CI had not been there more than an hour or two,\u201D she went on, \u201Cwhen\r\nthey arrived. I suppose Florimel--Lady Lossie--thought I would not come\r\nif she told me she expected them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd would you have come, my lady?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot endure the earl.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNeither can I. But then I know more about him than your ladyship does,\r\nand I am miserable for my mistress.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt stung Clementina as if her heart had taken a beat backward. But her\r\nvoice was steadier than it had yet been as she returned--\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy should you be miserable for Lady Lossie?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI would die rather than see her marry that wretch,\u201D he answered.\r\n\r\nAgain her blood stung her in the left side.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou do not want her to marry, then?\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do,\u201D answered Malcolm, emphatically, \u201Cbut not _that_ fellow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhom then, if I may ask?\u201D ventured Clementina, trembling.\r\n\r\nBut Malcolm was silent. He did not feel it would be right to say.\r\nClementina turned sick at heart.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have heard there is something dangerous about the moonlight,\u201D she\r\nsaid. \u201CI think it does not suit me to-night. I will go--home.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm sprung to his feet and offered his hand. She did not take it,\r\nbut rose more lightly, though more slowly than he.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow did you come from the park, my lady?\u201D he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy a gate over there,\u201D she answered, pointing. \u201CI wandered out after\r\ndinner, and the sea drew me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf your ladyship will allow me, I will take you a much nearer way\r\nback,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo then,\u201D she returned.\r\n\r\nHe thought she spoke a little sadly, and set it down to her hating\r\nto go back to her fellow-guests. What if she should leave to-morrow\r\nmorning! he thought. He could never then be sure she had really been\r\nwith him that night. He must then sometimes think it a dream. But oh,\r\nwhat a dream! He could thank God for it all his life, if he should\r\nnever dream so again.\r\n\r\nThey walked across the grassy sand towards the tunnel in silence, he\r\npondering what he could say that might comfort her and keep her from\r\ngoing so soon.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady never takes me out with her now,\u201D he said at length.\r\n\r\nHe was going to add that, if she pleased, he could wait upon her with\r\nKelpie, and show her the country. But then he saw that, if she were\r\nnot with Florimel, his sister would be riding everywhere alone with\r\nLiftore. Therefore he stopped short.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you feel forsaken--deserted?\u201D returned Clementina, sadly still.\r\n\r\n\u201CRather, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey had reached the tunnel. It looked very black when he opened the\r\ndoor, but there was just a glimmer through the trees at the other end.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is the valley of the shadow of death,\u201D she said. \u201CDo I walk\r\nstraight through?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, my lady. You will soon come out in the light again,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre there no steps to fall down?\u201D she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CNone, my lady. But I will go first if you wish.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, that would but cut off the little light I have,\u201D she said. \u201CCome\r\nbeside me.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey passed through in silence, save for the rustle of her dress, and\r\nthe dull echo that haunted their steps. In a few moments they came\r\nout among the trees, but both continued silent. The still, thoughtful\r\nmoon-night seemed to press them close together, but neither knew that\r\nthe other felt the same.\r\n\r\nThey reached a point in the road where another step would bring them in\r\nsight of the house.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou cannot go wrong now, my lady,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CIf you please I will\r\ngo no farther.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you not live in the house?\u201D she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CI used to do as I liked, and could be there or with my grandfather. I\r\ndid mean to be at the House to-night, but my lady has given my room to\r\nher maid.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat! that woman Caley?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI suppose so, my lady. I must sleep to-night in the village. If you\r\ncould, my lady,\u201D he added, after a pause, and faltered, hesitating.\r\nShe did not help him, but waited. \u201CIf you could--if you would not be\r\ndispleased at my asking you,\u201D he resumed, \u201C--if you _could_ keep my\r\nlady from going farther with that--I shall call him names if I go on!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is a strange request,\u201D Clementina replied, after a moment\u2019s\r\nreflection. \u201CI hardly know, as the guest of Lady Lossie, what answer\r\nI ought to make to it. One thing I will say, however, that, though\r\nyou may know more of the man than I, you can hardly dislike him more.\r\nWhether I can interfere is another matter. Honestly, I do not think it\r\nwould be of any use. But I do not say I will not. Good night.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe hurried away, and did not again offer her hand.\r\n\r\nMalcolm walked back through the tunnel, his heart singing and making\r\nmelody. Oh how lovely, how more than lovely, how divinely beautiful\r\nshe was! And so kind and friendly! Yet she seemed just the least bit\r\nfitful too. Something troubled her, he said to himself. But he little\r\nthought that he, and no one else, had spoiled the moonlight for her. He\r\nwent home to glorious dreams--she to a troubled half wakeful night. Not\r\nuntil she had made up her mind to do her utmost to rescue Florimel from\r\nLiftore, even if it gave her to Malcolm, did she find a moment\u2019s quiet.\r\nIt was morning then, but she fell fast asleep, slept late, and woke\r\nrefreshed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nCONFESSION OF SIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Crathie was slowly recovering, but still very weak. He did not,\r\nafter having turned the corner, get well so fast as his medical\r\nminister judged he ought, and the reason was plain to Lizzy, dimly\r\nperceptible to his wife: he was ill at ease. A man may have more mind\r\nand more conscience, and more discomfort in both or either, than his\r\nneighbours give him credit for. They may be in the right about him\r\nup to a certain point in his history, but then a crisis, by them\r\nunperceived, perhaps to them inappreciable, arrived, after which the\r\nman to all eternity could never be the same as they had known him.\r\nSuch a change must appear improbable, and save on the theory of a\r\nhigher operative power, is improbable because impossible. But a man who\r\nhas not created himself can never secure himself against the inroad\r\nof the glorious terror of that Goodness which was able to utter him\r\ninto being, with all its possible wrongs and repentances. The fact\r\nthat a man has never, up to any point yet, been aware of aught beyond\r\nhimself, cannot shut him out who is beyond him, when at last he means\r\nto enter. Not even the soul-benumbing visits of his clerical minister\r\ncould repress the swell of the slow-mounting dayspring in the soul\r\nof the hard, commonplace, business-worshipping man, Hector Crathie.\r\nThe hireling would talk to him kindly enough--of his illness, or of\r\nevents of the day, especially those of the town and neighbourhood, and\r\nencourage him with reiterated expression of the hope that ere many days\r\nthey would enjoy a tumbler together as of old, but as to wrong done,\r\napology to make, forgiveness to be sought, or consolation to be found,\r\nthe dumb dog had not uttered a bark.\r\n\r\nThe sources of the factor\u2019s restless discomfort were now two; the\r\nfirst, that he had lifted his hand to women; the second, the old ground\r\nof his quarrel with Malcolm, brought up by Lizzy.\r\n\r\nAll his life, since ever he had had business, Mr Crathie had prided\r\nhimself on his honesty, and was therefore in one of the most dangerous\r\nmoral positions a man could occupy--ruinous even to the honesty itself.\r\nAsleep in the mud, he dreamed himself awake on a pedestal. At best such\r\na man is but perched on a needle point when he thinketh he standeth. Of\r\nhim who prided himself on his honour I should expect that one day, in\r\nthe long run it might be, he would do some vile thing. Not, probably,\r\nwithin the small circle of illumination around his wretched rushlight,\r\nbut in the great region beyond it, of what to him is a moral darkness,\r\nor twilight vague, he may be or may become capable of doing a deed\r\nthat will stink in the nostrils of the universe--and in his own when\r\nhe knows it as it is. The honesty in which a man can pride himself\r\nmust be a small one, for more honesty will ever reveal more defect,\r\nwhile perfect honesty will never think of itself at all. The limited\r\nhonesty of the factor clave to the interests of his employers, and let\r\nthe rights he encountered take care of themselves. Those he dealt with\r\nwere to him rather as enemies than friends, not enemies to be prayed\r\nfor, but to be spoiled. Malcolm\u2019s doctrine of honesty in horse-dealing\r\nwas to him ludicrously new. His notion of honesty in that kind was to\r\ncheat the buyer for his master if he could, proud to write in his book\r\na large sum against the name of the animal. He would have scorned in\r\nhis very soul the idea of making a farthing by it himself through any\r\nbusiness quirk whatever, but he would not have been the least ashamed\r\nif, having sold Kelpie, he had heard--let me say, after a week of\r\npossession--that she had dashed out her purchaser\u2019s brains. He would\r\nhave been a little shocked, a little sorry perhaps, but nowise ashamed.\r\n\u201CBy this time,\u201D he would have said, \u201Cthe man ought to have been up to\r\nher, and either taken care of himself--or _sold her again_,\u201D--to dash\r\nout another man\u2019s brains instead!\r\n\r\nThat the bastard Malcolm, or the ignorant and indeed fallen fisher-girl\r\nLizzy, should judge differently, nowise troubled him: what could they\r\nknow about the rights and wrongs of business? The fact which Lizzy\r\nsought to bring to bear upon him, that our Lord would not have done\r\nsuch a thing, was to him no argument at all. He said to himself with\r\nthe superior smile of arrogated common-sense, that \u201Cno mere man since\r\nthe fall\u201D could be expected to do like him; that he was divine, and had\r\nnot to fight for a living; that he set us an example that we might see\r\nwhat sinners we were; that religion was one thing, and a very proper\r\nthing, but business was another, and a very proper thing also--with\r\ncustoms and indeed laws of its own far more determinate, at least\r\ndefinite, than those of religion, and that to mingle the one with the\r\nother was not merely absurd--it was irreverent and wrong, and certainly\r\nnever intended in the Bible, which must surely be common sense. It was\r\n_the Bible_ always with him,--never _the will of Christ_. But although\r\nhe could dispose of the question thus satisfactorily, yet, as he lay\r\nill, supine, without any distracting occupation, the thing haunted him.\r\n\r\nNow in his father\u2019s cottage had lain, much dabbled in of the children,\r\na certain boardless copy of the Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, round in the face\r\nand hollow in the back, in which, amongst other pictures was one of\r\nthe Wicket-gate. This scripture of his childhood, given by inspiration\r\nof God, threw out, in one of his troubled and feverish nights, a\r\ndream-bud in the brain of the man. He saw the face of Jesus looking\r\non him over the top of the Wicket-gate, at which he had been for some\r\ntime knocking in vain, while the cruel dog barked loud from the enemy\u2019s\r\nyard. But that face, when at last it came, was full of sorrowful\r\ndispleasure. And in his heart he knew that it was because of a certain\r\ntransaction in horse-dealing, wherein he had hitherto lauded his own\r\ncunning--adroitness, he considered it--and success. One word only he\r\nheard from the lips of the Man --\u201CWorker of iniquity,\u201D--and woke with\r\na great start. From that moment truths _began_ to be facts to him. The\r\nbeginning of the change was indeed very small, but every beginning is\r\nsmall, and every beginning is a creation. Monad, molecule, protoplasm,\r\nwhatever word may be attached to it when it becomes appreciable by\r\nmen, being then, however many stages, I believe, upon its journey,\r\n_beginning_ is an irrepressible fact; and however far from good or\r\nhumble even after many days, the man here began to grow good and\r\nhumble. His dull unimaginative nature, a perfect lumber-room of the\r\nworld and its rusting affairs, had received a gift in a dream--a truth\r\nfrom the lips of the Lord, remodelled in the brain and heart of the\r\ntinker of Elstow, and sent forth in his wondrous parable to be pictured\r\nand printed, and lie in old Hector Crathie\u2019s cottage, that it might\r\nenter and lie in young Hector Crathie\u2019s brain until he grew old and had\r\ndone wrong enough to heed it, when it rose upon him in a dream, and\r\nhad its way. Henceforth the claims of his neighbour began to reveal\r\nthemselves, and his mind to breed conscientious doubts and scruples,\r\nwith which, struggle as he might against it, a certain respect for\r\nMalcolm would keep coming and mingling--a feeling which grew with its\r\nreturns, until, by slow changes, he began at length to regard him as\r\nthe minister of God\u2019s vengeance--for his punishment,--and perhaps\r\nsalvation-- who could tell?\r\n\r\nLizzy\u2019s nightly ministrations had not been resumed, but she often\r\ncalled, and was a good deal with him; for Mrs Crathie had learned to\r\nlike the humble, helpful girl still better when she found she had taken\r\nno offence at being deprived of her post of honour by his bedside.\r\nOne day, when Malcolm was seated, mending a net, among the thin grass\r\nand great red daisies of the links by the bank of the burn, where it\r\ncrossed the sands from the Lossie grounds to the sea, Lizzy came up to\r\nhim and said,\r\n\r\n\u201CThe factor wad like to see ye, Ma\u2019colm, as sune \u2019s ye can gang till\r\n\u2019im.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe waited no reply. Malcolm rose and went.\r\n\r\nAt the factor\u2019s, the door was opened by Mrs Crathie herself, who,\r\nlooking mysterious, led him to the dining-room, where she plunged at\r\nonce into business, doing her best to keep down all manifestation of\r\nthe profound resentment she cherished against him. Her manner was\r\nconfidential, almost coaxing.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe see, Ma\u2019colm,\u201D she said, as if pursuing instead of commencing a\r\nconversation, \u201Che\u2019s some sore about the little _fraicass_ between him\r\n\u2019an you. Jist make your apoalogies till \u2019im and tell \u2019im you had a drop\r\ntoo much, and you\u2019re soary for misbehavin\u2019 yersel\u2019 to wann sae much\r\nyour shuperrior. Tell him that, Ma\u2019colm, an\u2019 there\u2019s a half-croon to\r\nye.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe wished much to speak English, and I have tried to represent the\r\nthing she did speak, which was neither honest Scotch nor anything\r\nlike English. Alas! the good, pithy, old Anglo-saxon dialect is fast\r\nperishing, and a jargon of corrupt English taking its place.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut, mem,\u201D said Malcolm, taking no notice either of the coin or the\r\nwords that accompanied the offer of it, \u201CI canna lee. I wasna in drink,\r\nan\u2019 I\u2019m no sorry.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHoot!\u201D returned Mrs Crathie, blurting out her Scotch fast enough now,\r\n\u201CI s\u2019 warran\u2019 ye can lee weel eneuch whan ye ha\u2019e occasion. Tak yer\r\nsiller, an\u2019 du as I tell ye.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWad ye ha\u2019e me damned, mem?\u201D\r\n\r\nMrs Crathie gave a cry and held up her hands. She was too well\r\naccustomed to imprecations from the lips of her husband for any but\r\nan affected horror, but, regarding the honest word as a bad one, she\r\nassumed an air of injury.\r\n\r\n\u201CWad ye daur to sweir afore a leddy,\u201D she exclaimed, shaking her\r\nuplifted hands in pretence of ghasted astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf Mr Crathie wishes to see me, ma\u2019am,\u201D rejoined Malcolm, taking up\r\nthe shield of English, \u201CI am ready. If not, please allow me to go.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe same moment the bell whose rope was at the head of the factor\u2019s\r\nbed, rang violently, and Mrs Crathie\u2019s importance collapsed.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome this w\u2019y,\u201D she said, and turning, led him up the stair to the\r\nroom where her husband lay.\r\n\r\nEntering, Malcolm stood astonished at the change he saw upon the strong\r\nman of rubicund countenance, and his heart filled with compassion.\r\nThe factor was sitting up in bed, looking very white and worn and\r\ntroubled. Even his nose had grown thin and white. He held out his hand\r\nto him, and said to his wife, \u201CTak the door to ye, Mistress Crathie,\u201D\r\nindicating which side he wished it closed from.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe was some sair upo\u2019 me, Ma\u2019colm,\u201D he went on, grasping the youth\u2019s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\u201CI doobt I was _ower_ sair,\u201D said Malcolm, who could hardly speak for a\r\nlump in his throat.\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, I deserved it. But eh, Ma\u2019colm! I canna believe it was me: it\r\nbude to be the drink.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt _was_ the drink,\u201D rejoined Malcolm; \u201Can\u2019 eh sir! afore ye rise frae\r\nthat bed, sweir to the great God \u2019at ye\u2019ll never drink nae mair drams,\r\nnor onything \u2019ayont ae tum\u2019ler at a sittin\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI sweir \u2019t; I sweir \u2019t, Ma\u2019colm!\u201D cried the factor.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s easy to sweir \u2019t noo, sir, but whan ye\u2019re up again it\u2019ll be hard\r\nto keep yer aith.--O Lord!\u201D spoke the youth, breaking out into almost\r\ninvoluntary prayer, \u201Chelp this man to haud troth wi\u2019 thee.--An\u2019 noo,\r\nMaister Crathie,\u201D he resumed, \u201CI\u2019m yer servan\u2019, ready to do onything I\r\ncan. Forgi\u2019e me, sir, for layin\u2019 on ower sair.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI forgi\u2019e ye wi\u2019 a\u2019 my hert,\u201D returned the factor, inly delighted to\r\nhave something to forgive.\r\n\r\n\u201CI thank ye frae mine,\u201D answered Malcolm, and again they shook hands.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut eh, Ma\u2019colm, my man!\u201D said the factor, \u201Choo will I ever shaw my\r\nface again?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFine that!\u201D returned Malcolm, eagerly. \u201CFowk\u2019s terrible guid-natur\u2019d\r\nwhan ye alloo \u2019at ye\u2019re i\u2019 the wrang. I do believe \u2019at whan a man\r\nconfesses till \u2019s neebour, an\u2019 says he\u2019s sorry, he thinks mair o\u2019 \u2019im\r\nnor afore he did it. Ye see we a\u2019 ken we ha\u2019e dune wrang, but we ha\u2019ena\r\na\u2019 confessed. An\u2019 it\u2019s a queer thing, but a man\u2019ll think it gran\u2019 o\u2019 \u2019s\r\nneebour to confess, whan a\u2019 the time there\u2019s something he winna repent\r\no\u2019 himsel\u2019 for fear o\u2019 the _shame_ o\u2019 ha\u2019ein\u2019 to confess \u2019t. To me,\r\nthe shame lies in _no_ confessin\u2019 efter ye ken ye\u2019re wrang. Ye\u2019ll see,\r\nsir--the fisher-fowk\u2019ll min\u2019 what ye say to them a heap better noo.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDiv ye railly think it, Ma\u2019colm?\u201D sighed the factor with a flush.\r\n\r\n\u201CI div that, sir. Only whan ye grow better, gien ye\u2019ll alloo me to\r\nsay \u2019t, sir, ye maunna lat Sawtan temp\u2019 ye to think \u2019at this same\r\nrepentin\u2019 was but a wakeness o\u2019 the flesh, an\u2019 no an enlichtenment o\u2019\r\nthe speerit.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI s\u2019 tie mysel\u2019 up till \u2019t,\u201D cried the factor, eagerly. \u201CGang an\u2019 tell\r\nthem i\u2019 my name, \u2019at I tak back ilka scart o\u2019 a nottice I ever ga\u2019e\r\nane o\u2019 them to quit, only we maun ha\u2019e nae mair stane\u2019in\u2019 o\u2019 honest\r\nfowk \u2019at comes to bigg herbours till them.--Div ye think it wad be weel\r\nta\u2019en gien ye tuik a poun\u2019-nott the piece to the twa women?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wadna du that, sir, gien I was you,\u201D answered Malcolm. \u201CFor yer ain\r\nsake, I wadna to Mistress Mair, for naething wad gar her tak it--it\r\nwad only affront her; an\u2019 for Nancy Tacket\u2019s sake, I wadna to her, for\r\nas her name, so\u2019s her natur\u2019: she wad not only tak it, but she wad lat\r\nye play the same as aften \u2019s ye likit for less siller.

Portlossie wadna ken \u2019tsel\u2019 wantin\u2019 ye. Jist\r\ngie me a commission to say to the twa honest women \u2019at ye\u2019re sorry for\r\nwhat ye did, an\u2019 that\u2019s a\u2019 \u2019at need be said \u2019atween you an them, or\r\ntheir men aither.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe result showed that Malcolm was right; for, the very next day,\r\ninstead of looking for gifts from him, the two injured women came to\r\nthe factor\u2019s door, first Annie Mair, with the offering of a few fresh\r\neggs, scarce at the season, and after her Nancy Tacket, with a great\r\nlobster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nA VISITATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMalcolm\u2019s custom was, first, immediately after breakfast, to give\r\nKelpie her airing--and a tremendous amount of air she wanted for the\r\nhuge animal furnace of her frame, and the fiery spirit that kept it\r\nalight; then, returning to the Seaton, to change the dress of the\r\ngroom, in which he always appeared about the house, lest by any chance\r\nhis mistress should want him, for that of the fisherman, and help\r\nwith the nets, or the boats, or in whatever was going on. As often as\r\nhe might he did what seldom a man would--went to the long shed where\r\nthe women prepared the fish for salting, took a knife, and wrought as\r\ndeftly as any of them, throwing a marvellously rapid succession of\r\ncleaned herrings into the preserving brine. It was no wonder he was a\r\nfavourite with the women. Although, however, the place was malodorous\r\nand the work dirty, I cannot claim so much for Malcolm as may at first\r\nappear to belong to him, for he had been accustomed to the sight and\r\nsmell from earliest childhood. Still, as I say, it was work the men\r\nwould not do. He had such a chivalrous humanity that it was misery to\r\nhim to see man or woman at anything scorned, except he bore a hand\r\nhimself. He did it half in love, half in terror of being unjust.\r\n\r\nHe had gone to Mr Crathie in his fisher-clothes, thinking it better\r\nthe sick man should not be reminded of the cause of his illness more\r\nforcibly than could not be helped. The nearest way led past a corner of\r\nthe house overlooked by one of the drawing-room windows, Clementina saw\r\nhim, and, judging by his garb that he would probably return presently,\r\nwent out in the hope of meeting him; and as he was going back to his\r\nnet by the sea-gate, he caught sight of her on the opposite side of the\r\nburn, accompanied only by a book. He walked through the burn, climbed\r\nthe bank, and approached her.\r\n\r\nIt was a hot summer afternoon. The burn ran dark and brown and cool\r\nin deep shade, but the sea beyond was glowing in light, and the\r\nlaburnum-blossoms hung like cocoons of sunbeams. No breath of air\r\nwas stirring; no bird sang; the sun was burning high in the west.\r\nClementina stood waiting him, like a moon that could hold her own in\r\nthe face of the sun.\r\n\r\n\u201CMalcolm,\u201D she said, \u201CI have been watching all day, but have not found\r\na single opportunity of speaking to your mistress as you wished. But to\r\ntell the truth, I am not sorry, for the more I think about it, the less\r\nI see what to say. That another does not like a person, can have little\r\nweight with one who does, and I _know_ nothing against him. I wish you\r\nwould release me from my promise. It is such an ugly thing to speak to\r\none\u2019s hostess to the disadvantage of a fellow-guest!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI understand,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CIt was not a right thing to ask of you.\r\nI beg your pardon, my lady, and give you back your promise, if such you\r\ncount it. But indeed I do not think you promised.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, I would rather be free. Had it been before you left\r\nLondon--. --Lady Lossie is very kind, but does not seem to put the same\r\nconfidence in me as formerly. She and Lady Bellair and that man make a\r\ntrio, and I am left outside. I almost think I ought to go. Even Caley\r\nis more of a friend than I am. I cannot get rid of the suspicion that\r\nsomething not right is going on. There seems a bad air about the place.\r\nThose two are playing their game with the inexperience of that poor\r\nchild, your mistress.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI know that very well, my lady, but I hope yet they will not win,\u201D\r\nsaid Malcolm.\r\n\r\nBy this time they were near the tunnel.\r\n\r\n\u201CCould you let me through to the shore?\u201D asked Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly, my lady.--I wish you could see the boats go out. From the\r\nBoar\u2019s Tail it is a pretty sight. They will all be starting together as\r\nsoon as the tide turns.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon Clementina began questioning him about the night-fishing,\r\nand Malcolm described its pleasures and dangers, and the pleasures of\r\nits dangers, in such fashion that Clementina listened with delight. He\r\ndwelt especially on the feeling almost of disembodiment, and existence\r\nas pure thought, arising from the all-pervading clarity and fluidity,\r\nthe suspension, and the unceasing motion.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish I could once feel like that,\u201D exclaimed Clementina. \u201CCould I\r\nnot go with you--for one night--just for once, Malcolm?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady, it would hardly do, I am afraid. If you knew the discomforts\r\nthat must assail one unaccustomed--I cannot tell--but I doubt if you\r\nwould go. All the doors to bliss have their defences of swamps and\r\nthorny thickets through which alone they can be gained. You would need\r\nto be a fisherman\u2019s sister--or wife, I fear, my lady, to get through to\r\nthis one.\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina smiled gravely, but did not reply, and Malcolm too was\r\nsilent, thinking.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D he said at last, \u201CI see how we can manage it. You shall have a\r\nboat for your own use, my lady, and----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I want to see just what you see, and to feel, as nearly as I may,\r\nwhat you feel. I don\u2019t want a downy, rose-leaf notion of the thing. I\r\nwant to understand what you fishermen encounter and experience.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe _must_ make a difference though, my lady. Look what clothes, what\r\nboots we fishers must wear to be fit for our work! But you shall have\r\na true idea as far as it reaches, and one that will go a long way\r\ntowards enabling you to understand the rest. You shall go in a real\r\nfishing-boat, with a full crew and all the nets, and you shall catch\r\nreal herrings; only you shall not be out longer than you please.--But\r\nthere is hardly time to arrange for it to-night, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTo-morrow then?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. I have no doubt I can manage it then.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, thank you!\u201D said Clementina. \u201CIt will be a great delight.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd now,\u201D suggested Malcolm, \u201Cwould you like to go through the\r\nvillage, and see some of the cottages, and how the fishers live?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf they would not think me inquisitive, or intrusive,\u201D answered\r\nClementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is no danger of that,\u201D rejoined Malcolm. \u201CIf it were my Lady\r\nBellair, to patronize, and deal praise and blame, as if what she calls\r\npoverty were fault and childishness, and she their spiritual as well\r\nas social superior, they might very likely be what she would call\r\nrude. She was here once before, and we have some notion of her about\r\nthe Seaton. I venture to say there is not a woman in it who is not her\r\nmoral superior, and many of them are her superiors in intellect and\r\ntrue knowledge, if they are not so familiar with London scandal. Mr\r\nGraham says that in the kingdom of heaven every superior is a ruler,\r\nfor there to rule is to raise, and a man\u2019s rank is his power to uplift.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI would I were in the kingdom of heaven, if it be such as you and Mr\r\nGraham take it for,\u201D said Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must be in it, my lady, or you couldn\u2019t wish it to be such as it\r\nis.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCan one then be in it, and yet seem to be out of it, Malcolm?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSo many are out of it that seem to be in it, my lady, that one might\r\nwell imagine it the other way with some.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you not uncharitable, Malcolm?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COur Lord speaks of many coming up to his door confident of admission,\r\nwhom yet he sends from him. Faith is obedience, not confidence.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen I do well to fear.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, my lady, so long as your fear makes you knock the louder.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut if I be in, as you say, how can I go on knocking?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere are a thousand more doors to knock at after you are in, my lady.\r\nNo one content to stand just inside the gate will be inside it long.\r\nBut it is one thing to be in, and another to be satisfied that we are\r\nin. Such a satisfying as comes from our own feelings may, you see from\r\nwhat our Lord says, be a false one. It is one thing to gather the\r\nconviction for ourselves, and another to have it from God. What wise\r\nman would have it before he gives it? He who does what his Lord tells\r\nhim, is in the kingdom, if every feeling of heart or brain told him he\r\nwas out. And his Lord will see that he knows it one day. But I do not\r\nthink, my lady, one can ever be quite sure, until the king himself has\r\ncome in to sup with him, and has let him know that he is altogether one\r\nwith him.\u201D\r\n\r\nDuring the talk of which this is the substance, they reached the\r\nSeaton, and Malcolm took her to see his grandfather.\r\n\r\n\u201CTaal and faer and chentle and coot!\u201D murmured the old man as he held\r\nher hand for a moment in his. With a start of suspicion he dropped it,\r\nand cried out in alarm--\u201CShe\u2019ll not pe a Cam\u2019ell, Malcolm?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNa, na, daddy--far frae that,\u201D answered Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen my laty will pe right welcome to Tuncan\u2019s heart,\u201D he replied, and\r\ntaking her hand again led her to a chair.\r\n\r\nWhen they left, she expressed herself charmed with the piper, but when\r\nshe learned the cause of his peculiar behaviour at first, she looked\r\ngrave, and found his feeling difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nThey next visited the Partaness, with whom she was far more amused\r\nthan puzzled. But her heart was drawn to the young woman who sat in\r\na corner, rocking her child in its wooden cradle, and never lifting\r\nher eyes from her needle-work: she knew her for the fisher-girl of\r\nMalcolm\u2019s picture.\r\n\r\nFrom house to house he took her, and where they went, they were\r\nwelcomed. If the man was smoking, he put away his pipe, and the woman\r\nleft her work and sat down to talk with her. They did the honours of\r\ntheir poor houses in a homely and dignified fashion. Clementina was\r\ndelighted. But Malcolm told her he had taken her only to the best\r\nhouses in the place to begin with. The village, though a fair sample of\r\nfishing villages, was no ex-sample, he said: there were all kinds of\r\npeople in it as in every other. It was a class in the big life-school\r\nof the world, whose special masters were the sea and the herrings.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat would you do now, if you were lord of the place?\u201D asked\r\nClementina, as they were walking back by the sea-gate; \u201C--I mean, what\r\nwould be the first thing you would do?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAs it would be my business to know my tenants that I might rule them,\u201D\r\nhe answered, \u201CI would first court the society and confidence of the\r\nbest men among them. I should be in no hurry to make changes, but\r\nwould talk openly with them, and try to be worthy of their confidence.\r\nOf course I would see a little better to their houses, and improve\r\ntheir harbour: and I would build a boat for myself that would show\r\nthem a better kind; but my main hope for them would be the same as for\r\nmyself--the knowledge of him whose is the sea and all its store, who\r\ncares for every fish in its bosom, but for the fisher more than many\r\nherrings. I would spend my best efforts to make them follow him whose\r\nfirst servants were the fishermen of Galilee, for with all my heart I\r\nbelieve that that Man holds the secret of life, and that only the man\r\nwho obeys him can ever come to know the God who is the root and crown\r\nof our being, and whom to know is freedom and bliss.\u201D\r\n\r\nA pause followed.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut do you not sometimes find it hard to remember God all through your\r\nwork?\u201D asked Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot very hard, my lady. Sometimes I wake up to find that I have been\r\nin an evil mood and forgetting him, and then life is hard until I get\r\nnear him again. But it is not my work that makes me forget him. When\r\nI go a-fishing, I go to catch God\u2019s fish; when I take Kelpie out, I\r\nam teaching one of God\u2019s wild creatures; when I read the Bible or\r\nShakspere, I am listening to the word of God, uttered in each after\r\nits kind. When the wind blows on my face, what matter that the chymist\r\npulls it to pieces! He cannot hurt it, for his knowledge of it cannot\r\nmake my feeling of it a folly, so long as he cannot pull that to pieces\r\nwith his retorts and crucibles: it is to me the wind of him who makes\r\nit blow, the sign of something in him, the fit emblem of his spirit,\r\nthat breathes into my spirit the breath of life. When Mr Graham talks\r\nto me, it is a prophet come from God that teaches me, as certainly as\r\nif his fiery chariot were waiting to carry him back when he had spoken;\r\nfor the word he utters at once humbles and uplifts my soul, telling it\r\nthat God is all in all and my God--that the Lord Christ is the truth\r\nand the life, and the way home to the Father.\u201D\r\n\r\nAfter a little pause,\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd when you are talking to a rich, ignorant, proud lady?\u201D said\r\nClementina, \u201C--what do you feel then?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat I would it were my lady Clementina instead,\u201D answered Malcolm\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\nShe held her peace.\r\n\r\nWhen he left her, Malcolm hurried to Scaurnose and arranged with\r\nBlue Peter for his boat and crew the next night. Returning to his\r\ngrandfather, he found a note waiting him from Mrs Courthope, to the\r\neffect that, as Miss Caley, her ladyship\u2019s maid, had preferred another\r\nroom, there was no reason why, if he pleased, he should not re-occupy\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nTHE EVE OF THE CRISIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late in the sweetest of summer mornings when the Partan\u2019s boat\r\nslipped slowly back with a light wind to the harbour of Portlossie.\r\nMalcolm did not wait to land the fish, but having changed his clothes\r\nand taken breakfast with Duncan, who was always up early, went to\r\nlook after Kelpie. When he had done with her, finding some of the\r\nhousehold already in motion, he went through the kitchen, and up the\r\nold cork-screw stone stair to his room to have the sleep he generally\r\nhad before his breakfast. Presently came a knock at his door, and there\r\nwas Rose.\r\n\r\nThe girl\u2019s behaviour to Malcolm was much changed. The conviction had\r\nbeen strengthened in her that he was not what he seemed, and she\r\nregarded him now with a vague awe. She looked this way and that along\r\nthe passage, with fear in her eyes, then stepped timidly inside the\r\nroom to tell him, in a hurried whisper, that she had seen the woman who\r\ngave her the poisonous philtre, talking to Caley the night before, at\r\nthe foot of the bridge, after everybody else was in bed. She had been\r\nmiserable till she could warn him. He thanked her heartily, and said he\r\nwould be on his guard; he would neither eat nor drink in the house. She\r\ncrept softly away. He secured the door, lay down, and trying to think\r\nfell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he woke his brain was clear. The very next day, whether Lenorme\r\ncame or not, he would declare himself. That night he would go fishing\r\nwith Lady Clementina, but not one day longer would he allow those\r\npeople to be about his sister. Who could tell what might not be\r\nbrewing, or into what abyss, with the help of her _friends_, the woman\r\nCatanach might not plunge Florimel?\r\n\r\nHe rose, took Kelpie out, and had a good gallop. On his way back he\r\nsaw in the distance Florimel riding with Liftore. The earl was on his\r\nfather\u2019s bay mare. He could not endure the sight, and dashed home at\r\nfull speed.\r\n\r\nLearning from Rose that Lady Clementina was in the flower-garden, he\r\nfound her at the swan-basin, feeding the gold and silver fishes. An\r\nunder-gardener who had been about the place for thirty years, was at\r\nwork not far off. The light splash of the falling column which the\r\nmarble swan spouted from its upturned beak, prevented her from hearing\r\nhis approach until he was close behind her. She turned, and her fair\r\nface took the flush of a white rose.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady,\u201D he said, \u201CI have got everything arranged for to-night.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd when shall we go?\u201D she asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201CAt the turn of the tide, about half-past seven. But seven is your\r\ndinner hour.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is of no consequence.--But could you not make it half an hour\r\nlater, and then I should not seem rude?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMake it any hour you please, my lady, so long as the tide is falling.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLet it be eight then, and dinner will be almost over. They will not\r\nmiss me after that. Mr Cairns is going to dine with them. I think,\r\nexcept Liftore, I never disliked a man so much. Shall I tell them where\r\nI am going?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, my lady. It will be better.--They will look amazed--for all their\r\nbreeding!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhose boat is it, that I may be able to tell them if they should ask\r\nme?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CJoseph Mair\u2019s. He and his wife will come and fetch you. Annie Mair\r\nwill go with us--if I may say _us_: will you allow me to go in your\r\nboat, my lady?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI couldn\u2019t go without you, Malcolm.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, my lady. Indeed I don\u2019t know how I could let you go without\r\nme! Not that there is anything to fear, or that I could make it the\r\nleast safer; but somehow it seems my business to take care of you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLike Kelpie?\u201D said Clementina, with a merrier smile than he had ever\r\nseen on her face before.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, my lady,\u201D answered Malcolm; \u201C--if to do for you all and the best\r\nyou will permit me to do, be to take care of you like Kelpie, then so\r\nit is.\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina gave a little sigh.\r\n\r\n\u201CMind you don\u2019t scruple, my lady, to give what orders you please. It\r\nwill be _your_ fishing-boat for to-night.\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina bowed her head in acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd now, my lady,\u201D Malcolm went on, \u201Cjust look about you for a moment.\r\nSee this great vault of heaven, full of golden light raining on trees\r\nand flowers--every atom of air shining. Take the whole into your heart,\r\nthat you may feel the difference at night, my lady --when the stars,\r\nand neither sun nor moon, will be in the sky, and all the flowers they\r\nshine on will be their own flitting, blinking, swinging, shutting and\r\nopening reflections in the swaying floor of the ocean,--when the heat\r\nwill be gone, and the air clean and clear as the thoughts of a saint.\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina did as he said, and gazed above and around her on the glory\r\nof the summer day overhanging the sweet garden, and on the flowers that\r\nhad just before been making her heart ache with their unattainable\r\nsecret. But she thought with herself that if Malcolm and she but shared\r\nit with a common heart as well as neighboured eyes, gorgeous day and\r\nethereal night, or snow-clad wild and sky of stormy blackness, were\r\nalike welcome to her spirit.\r\n\r\nAs they talked they wandered up the garden, and had drawn near the\r\nspot where, in the side of the glen, was hollowed the cave of the\r\nhermit. They now turned towards the pretty arbour of moss that covered\r\nits entrance, each thinking the other led, but Malcolm not without\r\nreluctance. For how horribly and unaccountably had he not been shaken,\r\nthe only time he ever entered it, at the sight of the hermit! The thing\r\nwas a foolish wooden figure, no doubt, but the thought that it still\r\nsat over its book in the darkest corner of the cave, ready to rise and\r\nadvance with outstretched hand to welcome its visitor, had, ever since\r\nthen, sufficed to make him shudder. He was on the point of warning\r\nClementina lest she too should be worse than startled, when he was\r\narrested by the voice of John Jack, the old gardener, who came stooping\r\nafter them, looking a sexton of flowers.\r\n\r\n\u201CMa\u2019colm, Ma\u2019colm!\u201D he cried, and crept up wheezing. \u201C--I beg yer\r\nleddyship\u2019s pardon, my leddy, but I wadna ha\u2019e Ma\u2019colm lat ye gang in\r\nthere ohn tellt ye what there is inside.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, John. I was just going to tell my lady,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause, ye see,\u201D pursued John, \u201CI was ae day here i\u2019 the gairden\r\n--an\u2019 I was jist graftin\u2019 a bonny wull rose-buss wi\u2019 a Hector o\u2019\r\nFrance--an\u2019 it grew to be the bonniest rose-buss in a\u2019 the haill\r\ngairden--whan the markis, no the auld markis, but my leddy\u2019s father,\r\ncam up the walk there, an\u2019 a bonny yoong leddy wi\u2019 his lordship, as it\r\nmicht be yersels twa--an\u2019 I beg yer pardon, my leddy, but I\u2019m an auld\r\nman noo, an\u2019 whiles forgets the differs \u2019atween fowk--an\u2019 this yoong\r\nleddy \u2019at they ca\u2019d Miss Cam\u2019ell-- ye kenned her yersel\u2019 efterhin\u2019,\r\nI daursay, Ma\u2019colm--he was unco ta\u2019en wi\u2019 her, the markis, as ilka\r\nbody cud see ohn luikit that near, sae \u2019at some saich \u2019at hoo he hed\r\nno richt to gang on wi\u2019 her that gait, garrin\u2019 her believe, gien he\r\nwasna gaein\u2019 to merry her. That\u2019s naither here nor there, hooever,\r\nseein\u2019 it a\u2019 cam to jist naething ava\u2019. Sae up they gaed to the cave\r\nyon\u2019er, as I was tellin\u2019 ye; an\u2019 hoo it was, was a won\u2019er, for I s\u2019\r\nwarran\u2019 she had been aboot the place near a towmon (_twelvemonth_),\r\nbut never had she been intill that cave, and kenned no more nor the\r\nbairn unborn what there was in \u2019t. An\u2019 sae whan the airemite, as the\r\nauld minister ca\u2019d him, though what for he ca\u2019d a muckle block like\r\nyon an _airy-mite_, I\u2019m sure I never cud fathom--whan he gat up, as I\r\nwas sayin\u2019, an\u2019 cam foret wi\u2019 his han\u2019 oot, she gae a scraich \u2019at jist\r\ngarred my lugs dirl, an\u2019 doon she drappit, an\u2019 there, whan I ran up,\r\nwas she lyin\u2019 i\u2019 the markis his airms, as white \u2019s a cauk eemege, an\u2019\r\nit was lang or he broucht her till hersel\u2019, for he wadna lat me rin for\r\nthe hoosekeeper, but sent me fleein\u2019 to the f\u2019untain for watter, an\u2019\r\ngied me a gowd guinea to haud my tongue aboot it a\u2019. Sae noo, my leddy,\r\nye\u2019re fore-warnt, an\u2019 no ill can come to ye, for there\u2019s naething to be\r\nfleyt at whan ye ken what\u2019s gauin\u2019 to meet ye.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm had turned his head aside, and now moved on without remark.\r\nStruck by his silence, Clementina looked up, and saw his face very\r\npale, and the tears standing in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must tell me the sad story, Malcolm,\u201D she murmured. \u201CI could\r\nscarcely understand a word the old man said.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe continued silent, and seemed struggling with some emotion. But when\r\nthey were within a few paces of the arbour, he stopped short, and said--\r\n\r\n\u201CI would rather not go in there to-day. You would oblige me, my lady,\r\nif you would not go.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him again, with wonder but more concern in her lovely\r\nface, put her hand on his arm, gently turned him away, and walked back\r\nwith him to the fountain. Not a word more did she say about the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\nSEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evening came; and the company at Lossie House was still seated at\r\ntable, Clementina heartily weary of the vapid talk that had been going\r\non all through the dinner, when she was informed that a fisherman of\r\nthe name of Mair was at the door, accompanied by his wife, saying they\r\nhad an appointment with her. She had already acquainted her hostess,\r\nwhen first they sat down, with her arrangements for going a-fishing\r\nthat night, and much foolish talk and would-be wit had followed; now,\r\nwhen she rose and excused herself, they all wished her a pleasant\r\nevening, in a tone indicating the conviction that she little knew what\r\nshe was about, and would soon be longing heartily enough to be back\r\nwith them in the drawing-room, whose lighted windows she would see from\r\nthe boat. But Clementina hoped otherwise, hurriedly changed her dress,\r\nhastened to join Malcolm\u2019s messengers, and almost in a moment had made\r\nthe two child-like people at home with her, by the simplicity and truth\r\nof her manner, and the directness of her utterance. They had not talked\r\nwith her five minutes before they said in their hearts that here was\r\nthe wife for the marquis if he could get her.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s jist like ane o\u2019 oorsels,\u201D whispered Annie to her husband on the\r\nfirst opportunity, \u201Conly a hantle better an\u2019 bonnier.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey took the nearest way to the harbour--through the town, and Lady\r\nClementina and Blue Peter kept up a constant talk as they went. All in\r\nthe streets and at the windows stared to see the grand lady from the\r\nHouse walking between a Scaurnose fisherman and his wife, and chatting\r\naway with them as if they were all fishers together.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the wordle comin\u2019 till!\u201D cried Mrs Mellis, the draper\u2019s wife,\r\nas she saw them pass.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m glaid to see the yoong wuman--an\u2019 a bonny lass she is!--in sic\r\nguid company,\u201D said Miss Horn, looking down from the opposite side of\r\nthe way. \u201CI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 the han\u2019 o\u2019 the markis \u2019ill be i\u2019 this, no\u2019!\u201D\r\n\r\nAll was ready to receive her, but in the present bad state of the\r\nharbour, and the tide having now ebbed a little way, the boat could\r\nnot get close either to quay or shore. Six of the crew were on board,\r\nseated on the thwarts with their oars shipped, for Peter had insisted\r\non a certain approximation to man-of-war manners and discipline for the\r\nevening, or at least until they got to the fishing ground. The shore\r\nitself formed one side of the harbour, and sloped down into it, and on\r\nthe sand stood Malcolm with a young woman, whom Clementina recognised\r\nat once as the girl she had seen at the Findlays\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady,\u201D he said, approaching, \u201Cwould you do me the favour to let\r\nLizzy go with you. She would like to attend your ladyship, because,\r\nbeing a fisherman\u2019s daughter, she is used to the sea, and Mrs Mair is\r\nnot so much at home upon it, being a farmer\u2019s daughter from inland.\u201D\r\n\r\nReceiving Clementina\u2019s thankful assent, he turned to Lizzy and said--\r\n\r\n\u201CMin\u2019 ye tell my leddy what rizon ye ken whaurfor my mistress at the\r\nHoose sudna be merried upo\u2019 Lord Liftore--him \u2019at was Lord Meikleham.\r\nYe may speyk to my leddy there as ye wad to mysel\u2019-- an\u2019 better, haein\u2019\r\nthe hert o\u2019 a wuman.\u201D\r\n\r\nLizzy blushed a deep red, and dared but the glimmer of a glance at\r\nClementina, but there was only shame, no annoyance in her face.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe winna repent it, Lizzy,\u201D concluded Malcolm, and turned away.\r\n\r\nHe cherished a faint hope that, if she heard or guessed Lizzy\u2019s story,\r\nClementina might yet find some way of bringing her influence to bear\r\non his sister even at the last hour of her chance--from which, for\r\nher sake, he shrunk the more the nearer it drew. Clementina held out\r\nher hand to Lizzy, and again accepted her offered service with kindly\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nNow Blue Peter, having been ship\u2019s-carpenter in his day, had\r\nconstructed a little poop in the stern of his craft; thereon Malcolm\r\nhad laid cushions and pillows and furs and blankets from the Psyche,--a\r\ngrafting of Cleopatra\u2019s galley upon the rude fishing-boat--and there\r\nClementina was to repose in state. Malcolm gave a sign: Peter took his\r\nwife in his arms, and walking through the few yards of water between,\r\nlifted her into the boat, which lay with its stern to the shore.\r\nMalcolm and Clementina turned to each other: he was about to ask leave\r\nto do her the same service, but she spoke before him.\r\n\r\n\u201CPut Lizzy on board first,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\nHe obeyed, and when, returning, he again approached her--\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you able, Malcolm?\u201D she asked. \u201CI am very heavy.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe smiled for all reply, took her in his arms like a child, and had\r\nplaced her on the cushions before she had time to realize the mode\r\nof her transference. Then taking a stride deeper into the water, he\r\nscrambled on board. The same instant the men gave way. They pulled\r\ncarefully through the narrow jaws of the little harbour, and away with\r\nquivering oar and falling tide, went the boat, gliding out into the\r\nmeasureless north, where the horizon was now dotted with the sails that\r\nhad preceded it.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were they afloat than a kind of enchantment enwrapped and\r\npossessed the soul of Clementina. Everything seemed all at once changed\r\nutterly. The very ends of the harbour piers might have stood in the\r\nDivina Commedia instead of the Moray Frith. Oh that wonderful look\r\neverything wears when beheld from the other side! Wonderful surely will\r\nthis world appear--strangely _more_, when, become children again by\r\nbeing gathered to our fathers--joyous day! we turn and gaze back upon\r\nit from the other side! I imagine that, to him who has overcome it, the\r\nworld, in very virtue of his victory, will show itself the lovely and\r\npure thing it was created-- for he will see through the cloudy envelope\r\nof his battle to the living kernel below. The cliffs, the rocks, the\r\nsands, the dune, the town, the very clouds that hung over the hill\r\nabove Lossie House, were in strange fashion transfigured. To think of\r\npeople sitting behind those windows while the splendour and freedom of\r\nspace with all its divine shows invited them--lay bare and empty to\r\nthem! Out and still out they rowed and drifted, till the coast began\r\nto open up beyond the headlands on either side. There a light breeze\r\nwas waiting them. Up then went three short masts, and three dark brown\r\nsails shone red in the sun, and Malcolm came aft, over the great heap\r\nof brown nets, crept with apology across the poop, and got down into a\r\nlittle well behind, there to sit and steer the boat; for now, obedient\r\nto the wind in its sails, it went frolicking over the sea.\r\n\r\nThe bonnie Annie bore a picked crew; for Peter\u2019s boat was to him a sort\r\nof church, in which he would not with his will carry any Jonah fleeing\r\nfrom the will of the lord of the sea. And that boat\u2019s crew did not look\r\nthe less merrily out of their blue eyes, or carry themselves the less\r\nmanfully in danger, that they believed a lord of the earth and the sea\r\nand the fountains of water cared for his children and would have them\r\nhonest and fearless.\r\n\r\nAnd now came a scattering of rubies and topazes over the slow waves,\r\nas the sun reached the edge of the horizon, and shone with a glory of\r\nblinding red along the heaving level of green, dashed with the foam of\r\ntheir flight. Could such a descent as this be intended for a type of\r\ndeath? Clementina asked. Was it not rather as if, from a corner of the\r\ntomb behind, she saw the back parts of a resurrection and ascension:\r\nwarmth, out-shining, splendour; departure from the door of the tomb;\r\nexultant memory; tarnishing gold, red fading to russet; fainting\r\nof spirit, loneliness; deepening blue and green; pallor, grayness,\r\ncoldness; out-creeping stars; further-reaching memory; the dawn of\r\ninfinite hope and foresight; the assurance that under passion itself\r\nlay a better and holier mystery? Here was God\u2019s naughty child, the\r\nworld, laid asleep and dreaming--if not merrily, yet contentedly; and\r\nthere was the sky with all the day gathered and hidden up in its blue,\r\nready to break forth again in laughter on the morrow, bending over its\r\nskyey cradle like a mother! and there was the aurora, the secret of\r\nlife, creeping away round to the north to be ready! Then first, when\r\nthe slow twilight had fairly settled into night, did Clementina begin\r\nto know the deepest marvel of this facet of the rose-diamond life!\r\nGod\u2019s night and sky and sea were hers now, as they had been Malcolm\u2019s\r\nfrom childhood! And when the nets had been paid out, and sank straight\r\ninto the deep, stretched betwixt leads below and floats and buoys\r\nabove, extending a screen of meshes against the rush of the watery\r\nherd; when the sails were down, and the whole vault of stars laid bare\r\nto her eyes as she lay; when the boat was still, fast to the nets,\r\nanchored as it were by hanging acres of curtain, and all was silent as\r\na church, waiting, and she might dream or sleep or pray as she would,\r\nwith nothing about her but peace and love and the deep sea, and over\r\nher but still peace and love and the deeper sky, then the soul of\r\nClementina rose and worshipped the soul of the universe; her spirit\r\nclave to the Life of her life, the Thought of her thought, the Heart of\r\nher heart; her will bowed itself to the creator of will, worshipping\r\nthe supreme, original, only Freedom--the Father of her love, the Father\r\nof Jesus Christ, the God of the hearts of the universe, the Thinker of\r\nall thoughts, the Beginner of all beginnings, the All-in-all. It was\r\nher first experience of speechless adoration.\r\n\r\nMost of the men were asleep in the bows of the boat; all were lying\r\ndown but one. That one was Malcolm. He had come aft, and seated himself\r\nunder the platform, leaning against it.\r\n\r\nThe boat rose and sank a little, just enough to rock the sleeping\r\nchildren a little deeper into their sleep; Malcolm thought all slept.\r\nHe did not see how Clementina\u2019s eyes shone back to the heavens--no star\r\nin them to be named beside those eyes. She knew that Malcolm was near\r\nher, but she would not speak; she would not break the peace of the\r\npresence. A minute or two passed. Then softly woke a murmur of sound,\r\nthat strengthened and grew, and swelled at last into a song. She feared\r\nto stir lest she should interrupt its flow. And thus it flowed:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The stars are steady abune;\r\n    I\u2019 the water they flichter an\u2019 flee;\r\n  But steady aye luikin\u2019 doon,\r\n    They ken themsels i\u2019 the sea.\r\n\r\n  A\u2019 licht, an\u2019 clear, an\u2019 free,\r\n    God, thou shinest abune;\r\n  Yet luik, an\u2019 see thysel\u2019 in me,\r\n    God, whan thou luikest doon.\r\n\r\n\r\nA silence followed, but a silence that seemed about to be broken.\r\nAnd again Malcolm sang:\r\n\r\n\r\n  There was an auld fisher--he sat by the wa\u2019,\r\n    An\u2019 luikit oot ower the sea;\r\n  The bairnies war playin\u2019, he smilit on them a\u2019,\r\n    But the tear stude in his e\u2019e.\r\n\r\n      _An\u2019 it\u2019s oh to win awa\u2019, awa\u2019!\r\n        An\u2019 it\u2019s oh to win awa\u2019\r\n      Whaur the bairns come hame, an\u2019 the wives they bide,\r\n        An\u2019 God is the Father o\u2019 a\u2019!_\r\n\r\n  Jocky an\u2019 Jeamy an\u2019 Tammy oot there,\r\n    A\u2019 i\u2019 the boatie gaed doon;\r\n  An\u2019 I\u2019m ower auld to fish ony mair,\r\n    An\u2019 I hinna the chance to droon.\r\n      _An\u2019 it\u2019s oh to win awa\u2019, awa\u2019! &c._\r\n\r\n  An\u2019 Jeanie she grat to ease her hert,\r\n    An\u2019 she easit hersel\u2019 awa\u2019;\r\n  But I\u2019m ower auld for the tears to stert,\r\n    An\u2019 sae the sighs maun blaw.\r\n      _An\u2019 it\u2019s oh to win awa\u2019, awa\u2019! &c._\r\n\r\n  Lord, steer me hame whaur my Lord has steerit,\r\n    For I\u2019m tired o\u2019 life\u2019s rockin\u2019 sea;\r\n  An\u2019 dinna be lang, for I\u2019m nearhan\u2019 fearit\r\n    \u2019At I\u2019m \u2019maist ower auld to dee.\r\n      _An\u2019 it\u2019s oh to win awa\u2019, awa\u2019! &c._\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain the stars and the sky were all, and there was no sound but the\r\nslight murmurous lipping of the low swell against the edges of the\r\nplanks. Then Clementina said:\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you make that song, Malcolm?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhilk o\u2019 them, my leddy?--But it\u2019s a\u2019 ane--they\u2019re baith mine, sic as\r\nthey are.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you,\u201D she returned.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat for, my leddy?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFor speaking Scotch to me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI beg your pardon, my lady. I forgot your ladyship was English.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPlease forget it,\u201D she said. \u201CBut I thank you for your songs too. It\r\nwas the second I wanted to know about; the first I was certain was your\r\nown. I did not know you could enter like that into the feelings of an\r\nold man.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy not, my lady? I never can see living thing without asking it how\r\nit feels. Often and often, out here at such a time as this, have I\r\ntried to fancy myself a herring caught by the gills in the net down\r\nbelow, instead of the fisherman in the boat above going to haul him\r\nout.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd did you succeed?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I fancy I came to understand as much of him as he does himself.\r\nIt\u2019s a merry enough life down there. The flukes--plaice, you call them,\r\nmy lady,--bother me, I confess. I never contemplate one without feeling\r\nas if I had been sat upon when I was a baby. But for an old man!--Why,\r\nthat\u2019s what I shall be myself one day most likely, and it would be a\r\nshame not to know pretty nearly how _he_ felt--near enough at least to\r\nmake a song about him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd shan\u2019t you mind being an old man, then, Malcolm?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot in the least, my lady. I shall mind nothing so long as I can trust\r\nin the maker of me. If my faith should give way--why then there would\r\nbe nothing worth minding either! I don\u2019t know but I should kill myself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMalcolm!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhich is worse, my lady--to distrust God, or to think life worth\r\nhaving without him?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut one may hope in the midst of doubt--at least that is what Mr\r\nGraham--and you--have taught me to do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, surely, my lady. I won\u2019t let anyone beat me at that, if I can\r\nhelp it. And I think that so long as I kept my reason, I should be\r\nable to cry out, as that grandest and most human of all the prophets\r\ndid--\u2018Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.\u2019 But would you not\r\nlike to sleep, my lady?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, Malcolm. I would much rather hear you talk.--Could you not tell me\r\na story now? Lady Lossie mentioned one you once told her about an old\r\ncastle somewhere not far from here----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEh, my leddy!\u201D broke in Annie Mair, who had waked up while they were\r\nspeaking, \u201CI wuss ye wad gar him tell ye that story, for my man he\u2019s\r\nh\u2019ard \u2019im tell \u2019t, an\u2019 he says it\u2019s unco gruesome: I wad fain hear\r\n\u2019t.--Wauk up, Lizzy,\u201D she went on, in her eagerness waiting for no\r\nanswer; \u201CMa\u2019colm\u2019s gauin\u2019 to tell \u2019s the tale o\u2019 the auld castel o\u2019\r\nColonsay.--It\u2019s oot by yon\u2019er, my leddy-- no that far frae the Deid\r\nHeid.--Wauk up, Lizzy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m no sleepin\u2019, Annie,\u201D said Lizzy, \u201C--though like Ma\u2019colm\u2019s auld\r\nman,\u201D she added with a sigh, \u201CI wad whiles fain be.\u201D\r\n\r\nNow there were reasons why Malcolm should not be unwilling to tell the\r\nstrange wild story requested of him, and he commenced it at once, but\r\nmodified the Scotch of it considerably for the sake of the unaccustomed\r\nears. When it was ended Clementina said nothing; Annie Mair said \u201CHech,\r\nsirs!\u201D and Lizzy with a great sigh, remarked,\r\n\r\n\u201CThe deil maun be in a\u2019thing whaur God hasna a han\u2019, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYe may tak yer aith upo\u2019 that,\u201D rejoined Malcolm.\r\n\r\nIt was a custom in Peter\u2019s boat never to draw the nets without a\r\nprayer, uttered now by one and now by another of the crew. Upon\r\nthis occasion, whether it was in deference to Malcolm, who, as he\r\nwell understood, did not like long prayers, or that the presence of\r\nClementina exercised some restraint upon his spirit, out of the bows of\r\nthe boat came now the solemn voice of its master, bearing only this one\r\nsentence:\r\n\r\n\u201COh Thoo, wha didst tell thy dissiples to cast the net upo\u2019 the side\r\nwhaur swam the fish, gien it be thy wull \u2019at we catch the nicht, lat \u2019s\r\ncatch; gien it binna thy wull, lat \u2019s no catch.--Haul awa\u2019, my laads.\u201D\r\n\r\nUp sprang the men, and went each to his place, and straight a torrent\r\nof gleaming fish was pouring in over the gunwale of the boat. Such a\r\ntake it was ere the last of the nets was drawn, as the oldest of them\r\nhad seldom seen. Thousands of fish there were that had never got into\r\nthe meshes at all.\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot understand it,\u201D said Clementina. \u201CThere are multitudes more\r\nfish than there are meshes in the nets to catch them: if they are not\r\ncaught, why do they not swim away?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause they are drowned, my lady,\u201D answered Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you mean by that? How can you drown a fish?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou may call it _suffocated_ if you like, my lady; it is all the same.\r\nYou have read of panic-stricken people, when a church or a theatre is\r\non fire, rushing to the door all in a heap, and crowding each other to\r\ndeath? It is something like that with the fish. They are swimming along\r\nin a great shoal, yards thick; and when the first can get no farther,\r\nthat does not at once stop the rest, any more than it would in a crowd\r\nof people; those that are behind come pressing up into every corner,\r\nwhere there is room, till they are one dense mass. Then they push and\r\npush to get forward, and can\u2019t get through, and the rest come still\r\ncrowding on behind and above and below, till a multitude of them are\r\njammed so tight against each other that they can\u2019t open their gills;\r\nand even if they could, there would not be air enough for them. You\u2019ve\r\nseen the goldfish in the swan-basin, my lady, how they open and shut\r\ntheir gills constantly: that\u2019s their way of getting air out of the\r\nwater by some wonderful contrivance nobody understands, for they need\r\nbreath just as much as we do: and to close their gills is to them the\r\nsame as closing a man\u2019s mouth and nose. That\u2019s how the most of those\r\nherrings are taken.\u201D\r\n\r\nAll were now ready to seek the harbour. A light westerly wind was still\r\nblowing, with the aid of which, heavy-laden, they crept slowly to the\r\nland. As she lay snug and warm, with the cool breath of the sea on her\r\nface, a half sleep came over Clementina, and she half dreamed that she\r\nwas voyaging in a ship of the air, through infinite regions of space,\r\nwith a destination too glorious to be known. The herring-boat was a\r\nliving splendour of strength and speed, its sails were as the wings of\r\na will, in place of the instruments of a force, and softly as mightily\r\nit bore them through the charmed realms of dreamland towards the ideal\r\nof the soul. And yet the herring-boat but crawled over the still waters\r\nwith its load of fish, as the harvest waggon creeps over the field with\r\nits piled up sheaves; and she who imagined its wondrous speed was the\r\nonly one who did not desire it should move faster.\r\n\r\nNo word passed between her and Malcolm all their homeward way. Each was\r\nbrooding over the night and its joy that enclosed them together, and\r\nhoping for that which was yet to be shaken from the lap of the coming\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAlso Clementina had in her mind a scheme for attempting what Malcolm\r\nhad requested of her; the next day must see it carried into effect;\r\nand ever and anon, like a cold blast of doubt invading the bliss of\r\nconfidence, into the heart of that sea-borne peace darted the thought,\r\nthat, if she failed, she must leave at once for England, for she would\r\nnot again meet Liftore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nSHORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last they glided once more through the stony jaws of the harbour,\r\nas if returning again to the earth from a sojourn in the land of the\r\ndisembodied. When Clementina\u2019s foot touched the shore she felt like one\r\nwaked out of a dream, from whom yet the dream has not departed--but\r\nkeeps floating about him, waved in thinner and yet thinner streams from\r\nthe wings of the vanishing sleep. It seemed almost as if her spirit,\r\ninstead of having come back to the world of its former abode, had\r\nbeen borne across the parting waters and landed on the shore of the\r\nimmortals. There was the ghost-like harbour of the spirit land, the\r\nwater gleaming betwixt its dark walls, one solitary boat motionless\r\nupon it, the men moving about like shadows in the star twilight! Here\r\nstood three women and a man on the shore, and save the stars no light\r\nshone, and from the land came no sound of life. Was it the dead of the\r\nnight, or a day that had no sun? It was not dark, but the light was\r\nrayless. Or, rather, it was as if she had gained the power of seeing in\r\nthe dark. Suppressed sleep wove the stuff of a dream around her, and\r\nthe stir at her heart kept it alive with dream-forms. Even the voice of\r\nPeter\u2019s Annie, saying, \u201CI s\u2019 bide for my man. Gude nicht, my leddy,\u201D\r\ndid not break the charm. Her heart shaped that also into the dream.\r\nTurning away with Malcolm and Lizzy, she passed along the front of the\r\nSeaton. How still, how dead, how empty like cenotaphs, all the cottages\r\nlooked! How the sea which lay like a watcher at their doors, murmured\r\nin its sleep! Arrived at the entrance to her own close, Lizzy next bade\r\nthem good night, and Clementina and Malcolm were left.\r\n\r\nAnd now drew near the full power, the culmination of the mounting\r\nenchantment of the night for Malcolm. When once the Scaurnose people\r\nshould have passed them, they would be alone--alone as in the spaces\r\nbetween the stars. There would not be a living soul on the shore\r\nfor hours. From the harbour the nearest way to the House was by the\r\nsea-gate, but where was the haste--with the lovely night around them,\r\nprivate as a dream shared only by two? Besides, to get in by that, they\r\nwould have had to rouse the cantankerous Bykes, and what a jar would\r\nnot that bring into the music of the silence! Instead, therefore, of\r\nturning up by the side of the stream where it crossed the shore, he\r\ntook Clementina once again in his arms unforbidden, and carried her\r\nover. Then the long sands lay open to their feet. Presently they heard\r\nthe Scaurnose party behind them, coming audibly, merrily on. As by a\r\ncommon resolve they turned to the left, and crossing the end of the\r\nBoar\u2019s Tail, resumed their former direction, with the dune now between\r\nthem and the sea. The voices passed on the other side, and they heard\r\nthem slowly merge into the inaudible. At length, after an interval of\r\nsilence, on the westerly air came one quiver of laughter--by which\r\nMalcolm knew his friends were winding up the red path to the top of the\r\ncliff. And now the shore was bare of presence, bare of sound save the\r\nsoft fitful rush of the rising tide. But behind the long sandhill, for\r\nall they could see of the sea, they might have been in the heart of a\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho would imagine the ocean so near us, my lady!\u201D said Malcolm, after\r\nthey had walked for some time without word spoken.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho can tell what may be near us?\u201D she returned.\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue, my lady. Our future is near us, holding thousands of things\r\nunknown. Hosts of thinking beings with endless-myriads of thoughts may\r\nbe around us. What a joy t\u2019 know that, of all things and all thoughts,\r\nGod is nearest to us--_so_ near that we cannot see him, but, far beyond\r\nseeing him, can know of him infinitely!\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he spoke they came opposite the tunnel, but he turned from it and\r\nthey ascended the dune. As their heads rose over the top, and the\r\nsky-night above and the sea-night beneath rolled themselves out and\r\nrushed silently together, Malcolm said, as if thinking aloud:\r\n\r\n\u201CThus shall we meet death and the unknown, and the new that breaks from\r\nthe bosom of the invisible will be better than the old upon which the\r\ngates close behind us. The Son of man is content with my future, and I\r\nam content.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was a peace in the words that troubled Clementina: he wanted\r\nno more than he had--this cold, imperturbable, devout fisherman! She\r\ndid not see that it was the confidence of having all things that held\r\nhis peace rooted. From the platform of the swivel, they looked abroad\r\nover the sea. Far north in the east lurked a suspicion of dawn, which\r\nseemed, while they gazed upon it, to \u201Clanguish into life,\u201D and the sea\r\nwas a shade less dark than when they turned from it to go behind the\r\ndune. They descended a few paces, and halted again.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid your ladyship ever see the sun rise?\u201D asked Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CNever in open country,\u201D she answered.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen stay and see it now, my lady. He\u2019ll rise just over yonder, a\r\nlittle nearer this way than that light from under his eyelids. A more\r\nglorious chance you could not have. And when he rises, just observe,\r\none minute after he is up, how like a dream all you have been in\r\nto-night will look. It is to me strange even to awfulness how many\r\ndifferent phases of things, and feelings about them, and moods of life\r\nand consciousness, God can tie up in the bundle of one world with one\r\nhuman soul to carry it.\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina slowly sank on the sand of the slope, and like lovely sphinx\r\nof northern desert, gazed in immovable silence out on the yet more\r\nnorthern sea. Malcolm took his place a little below, leaning on his\r\nelbow, for the slope was steep, and looking up at her. Thus they waited\r\nthe sunrise.\r\n\r\nWas it minutes or only moments passed in that silence--whose speech was\r\nthe soft ripple of the sea on the sand? Neither could have answered the\r\nquestion. At length said Malcolm,\r\n\r\n\u201CI think of changing my service, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed, Malcolm!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, my lady. My--mistress does not like to turn me away, but she is\r\ntired of me, and does not want me any longer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you would never think of finally forsaking a fisherman\u2019s life for\r\nthat of a servant, surely, Malcolm?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat would become of Kelpie, my lady?\u201D rejoined Malcolm, smiling to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D said Clementina, bewildered; \u201CI had not thought of her.-- But you\r\ncannot take her with you,\u201D she added, coming a little to her senses.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is nobody about the place who could, or rather, who would do\r\nanything with her. They would sell her. I have enough to buy her, and\r\nperhaps somebody might not object to the encumbrance, but hire me and\r\nher together.--_Your_ groom wants a coachman\u2019s place, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CO Malcolm! do you mean you would be _my_ groom?\u201D cried Clementina,\r\npressing her palms together.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you would have me, my lady; but I have heard you say you would have\r\nnone but a married man.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut--Malcolm--don\u2019t you know anybody that would--?--Could you not find\r\nsome one--some lady--that--?--I mean, why shouldn\u2019t you be a married\r\nman?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFor a very good and to me rather sad reason, my lady; the only woman I\r\ncould marry, or should ever be able to marry,--would not have me. She\r\nis very kind and very noble, but--it is preposterous --the thing is too\r\npreposterous. I dare not have the presumption to ask her.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm\u2019s voice trembled as he spoke, and a few moments\u2019 pause\r\nfollowed, during which he could not lift his eyes. The whole heaven\r\nseemed pressing down their lids. The breath which he modelled into\r\nwords seemed to come in little billows.\r\n\r\nBut his words had raised a storm in Clementina\u2019s bosom. A cry broke\r\nfrom her, as if driven forth by pain. She called up all the energy\r\nof her nature, and stilled herself to speak. The voice that came was\r\nlittle more than a sob-scattered whisper, but to her it seemed as if\r\nall the world must hear.\r\n\r\n\u201COh Malcolm!\u201D she panted, \u201CI _will_ try to be good and wise. Don\u2019t\r\nmarry anybody else--_anybody_, I mean; but come with Kelpie and be my\r\ngroom, and wait and see if I don\u2019t grow better.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm leaped to his feet and threw himself at hers. He had heard but\r\nin part, and he _must_ know all.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady,\u201D he said, with intense quiet, \u201CKelpie and I will be your\r\nslaves. Take me for fisherman--groom--what you will. I offer the whole\r\nsum of service that is in me.\u201D He kissed her feet.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady, I would put your feet on my head,\u201D he went on, \u201Conly then\r\nwhat should I do when I see my Lord, and cast myself before _him_?\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Clementina, again her own to give, rose quickly, and said with all\r\nthe dignity born of her inward grandeur,\r\n\r\n\u201CRise, Malcolm; you misunderstand me.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm rose abashed, but stood erect before her, save that his head\r\nwas bowed, for his heart was sunk in dismay. Then slowly, gently,\r\nClementina knelt before him. He was bewildered, and thought she was\r\ngoing to pray. In sweet, clear, unshaken tones, for she feared nothing\r\nnow, she said,\r\n\r\n\u201CMalcolm, I am not worthy of you. But take me--take my very soul if you\r\nwill, for it is yours.\u201D\r\n\r\nNow Malcolm saw that he had no right to raise a kneeling lady; all he\r\ncould do was to kneel beside her. When people kneel, they lift up their\r\nhearts; and the creating heart of their joy was forgotten of neither.\r\nAnd well for them, for the love where God is not, be the lady lovely as\r\nCordelia, the man gentle as Philip Sidney, will fare as the overkept\r\nmanna.\r\n\r\nWhen the huge tidal wave from the ocean of infinite delight had broken\r\nat last upon the shore of the finite, and withdrawn again into the\r\ndeeps, leaving every cistern brimming, every fountain overflowing, the\r\ntwo entranced souls opened their bodily eyes, looked at each other,\r\nrose, and stood hand in hand, speechless.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, my lady!\u201D said Malcolm at length, \u201Cwhat is to become of this\r\ndelicate smoothness in my great rough hand? Will it not be hurt?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t know how strong it is, Malcolm. There!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can scarcely feel it with my hand, my lady; it all goes through to\r\nmy heart. It shall lie in mine as the diamond in the rock.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, Malcolm! Now that I am going to be a fisherman\u2019s wife, it must\r\nbe a strong hand--it must work. What homage shall you require of me,\r\nMalcolm? What will you have me do to rise a little nearer your level?\r\nShall I give away lands and money? And shall I live with you in the\r\nSeaton? or will you come and fish at Wastbeach?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CForgive me, my lady; I can\u2019t think about things now--even with you in\r\nthem. There is neither past nor future to me now--only this one eternal\r\nmorning. Sit here, and look up, Lady Clementina: --see all those\r\nworlds:--something in me constantly says that I shall know every one of\r\nthem one day; that they are all but rooms in the house of my spirit,\r\nthat is, the house of our Father. Let us not now, when your love makes\r\nme twice eternal, talk of time and places. Come, let us fancy ourselves\r\ntwo blessed spirits, lying full in the sight and light of our God,--as\r\nindeed what else are we?--warming our hearts in his presence and peace;\r\nand that we have but to rise and spread our wings to soar aloft and\r\nfind--what shall it be, my lady? Worlds upon worlds? No, no. What are\r\nworlds upon worlds in infinite show until we have seen the face of the\r\nSon of Man?\u201D\r\n\r\nA silence fell. But he resumed.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet us imagine our earthly life behind us, our hearts clean, love all\r\nin all.--But that sends me back to the now. My lady, I know I shall\r\nnever love you aright until you have helped me perfect. When the face\r\nof the least lovely of my neighbours needs but appear to rouse in\r\nmy heart a divine tenderness, then it must be that I shall love you\r\nbetter than now. Now, alas! I am so pervious to wrong! so fertile of\r\nresentments and indignations! You must cure me, my divine Clemency.--Am\r\nI a poor lover to talk, this first glorious hour, of anything but my\r\nlady love? Ah! but let it excuse me that this love is no new thing\r\nto me. It is a very old love. I have loved you a thousand years. I\r\nlove every atom of your being, every thought that can harbour in your\r\nsoul, and I am jealous of hurting your blossoms with the over-jubilant\r\nwinds of that very love. I would therefore behold you folded in the\r\natmosphere of the Love eternal. My lady, if I were to talk of your\r\nbeauty, I should but offend you, for you would think I raved, and spoke\r\nnot the words of truth and soberness. But how often have I not cried\r\nto the God who breathed the beauty into you that it might shine out\r\nof you, to save my soul from the tempest of its own delight therein.\r\nAnd now I am like one that has caught an angel in his net, and fears\r\nto come too nigh, lest fire should flash from the eyes of the startled\r\nsplendour, and consume the net and him who holds it. But I will not\r\nrave, because I would possess in grand peace that which I lay at your\r\nfeet. I am yours, and would be worthy of your moonlight calm.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAlas! I am beside you but a block of marble!\u201D said Clementina. \u201CYou\r\nare so eloquent, my----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNew groom,\u201D suggested Malcolm gently.\r\n\r\nClementina smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut my heart is so full,\u201D she went on, \u201Cthat I cannot think the\r\nfilmiest thought. I hardly know that I feel. I only know that I want to\r\nweep.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeep then, my word ineffable!\u201D cried Malcolm, and laid himself again\r\nat her feet, kissed them, and was silent.\r\n\r\nHe was but a fisher-poet; no courtier, no darling of society, no dealer\r\nin the fine speeches, no clerk of compliments. All the words he had\r\nwere the living blossoms of thought rooted in feeling. His pure clear\r\nheart was as a crystal cup, through which shone the red wine of his\r\nlove. To himself Malcolm stammered as a dumb man, the string of whose\r\ntongue has but just been loosed; to Clementina his speech was as the\r\nsong of the Lady to Comus, \u201Cdivine enchanting ravishment.\u201D The God of\r\ntruth is surely present at every such marriage feast of two radiant\r\nspirits. Their joy was that neither had fooled the hope of the other.\r\n\r\nAnd so the herring boat had indeed carried Clementina over into\r\nparadise, and this night of the world was to her a twilight of heaven.\r\nGod alone can tell what delights it is possible for him to give to the\r\npure in heart who shall one day behold him. Like two that had died and\r\nfound each other, they talked until speech rose into silence, they\r\nsmiled until the dews which the smiles had sublimed claimed their turn\r\nand descended in tears.\r\n\r\nAll at once they became aware that an eye was upon them. It was the\r\nsun. He was ten degrees up the slope of the sky, and they had never\r\nseen him rise.\r\n\r\nWith the sun came a troublous thought, for with the sun came \u201Ca world\r\nof men.\u201D Neither they nor the simple fisher-folk, their friends, had\r\nthought of the thing, but now at length it occurred to Clementina that\r\nshe would rather not walk up to the door of Lossie House with Malcolm\r\nat this hour of the morning. Yet neither could she well appear alone.\r\nEre she had spoken Malcolm rose.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou won\u2019t mind being left, my lady,\u201D he said, \u201Cfor a quarter of an\r\nhour or so--will you? I want to bring Lizzy to walk home with you.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe went, and Clementina sat alone on the dune in a reposeful rapture,\r\nto which the sleeplessness of the night gave a certain additional\r\nintensity and richness and strangeness. She watched the great strides\r\nof her fisherman as he walked along the sands, and she seemed not to be\r\nleft behind, but to go with him every step. The tide was again falling,\r\nand the sea shone and sparkled and danced with life, and the wet sand\r\ngleamed, and a soft air blew on her cheek, and the lordly sun was\r\nmounting higher and higher, and a lark over her head was sacrificing\r\nall nature in his song; and it seemed as if Malcolm were still speaking\r\nstrange, half intelligible, altogether lovely things in her ears. She\r\nfelt a little weary, and laid her head down upon her arm to listen more\r\nat her ease.\r\n\r\nNow the lark had seen all and heard all, and was telling it again to\r\nthe universe, only in dark sayings which none but themselves could\r\nunderstand; therefore it is no wonder that, as she listened, his song\r\nmelted into a dream, and she slept. And the dream was lovely as dream\r\nneeds be, but not lovelier than the wakeful night. She opened her eyes,\r\ncalm as any cradled child, and there stood her fisherman!\r\n\r\n\u201CI have been explaining to Lizzy, my lady,\u201D he said, \u201Cthat your\r\nladyship would rather have her company up to the door than mine. Lizzy\r\nis to be trusted, my lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Deed, my leddy,\u201D said Lizzy, \u201CMa\u2019colm\u2019s been ower guid to me, no to\r\ngar me du onything he wad ha\u2019e o\u2019 me. I can haud my tongue whan I like,\r\nmy leddy. An\u2019 dinna doobt my thouchts, my leddy, for I ken Ma\u2019colm as\r\nweel \u2019s ye du yersel\u2019, my leddy.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhile she was speaking, Clementina rose, and they went straight to the\r\ndoor in the bank. Through the tunnel and the young wood and the dew\r\nand the morning odours, along the lovely paths the three walked to the\r\nhouse together. And oh, how the larks of the earth and the larks of the\r\nsoul sang for two of them! And how the burn rang with music, and the\r\nair throbbed with sweetest life! while the breath of God made a little\r\nsound as of a going now and then in the tops of the fir trees, and the\r\nsun shone his brightest and best, and all nature knew that the heart of\r\nGod is the home of his creatures.\r\n\r\nWhen they drew near the house Malcolm left them. After they had rung a\r\ngood many times, the door was opened by the housekeeper, looking very\r\nproper and just a little scandalized.\r\n\r\n\u201CPlease, Mrs Courthope,\u201D said Lady Clementina, \u201Cwill you give orders\r\nthat when this young woman comes to see me to-day she shall be shown up\r\nto my room?\u201D\r\n\r\nThen she turned to Lizzy and thanked her for her kindness, and they\r\nparted--Lizzy to her baby, and Clementina to yet a dream or two. Long\r\nbefore her dreams were sleeping ones, however, Malcolm was out in the\r\nbay in the Psyche\u2019s dinghy, catching mackerel: some should be for his\r\ngrandfather, some for Miss Horn, some for Mrs Courthope, and some for\r\nMrs Crathie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CREW OF THE BONNIE ANNIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving caught as many fish as he wanted, Malcolm rowed to the other\r\nside of the Scaurnose. There he landed and left the dinghy in the\r\nshelter of the rocks, the fish covered with long broad-leaved\r\n_tangles_, climbed the steep cliff, and sought Blue Peter. The brown\r\nvillage was quiet as a churchyard, although the sun was now growing\r\nhot. Of the men some were not yet returned from the night\u2019s fishing,\r\nand some were asleep in their beds after it. Not a chimney smoked. But\r\nMalcolm seemed to have in his own single being life and joy enough for\r\na world; such an intense consciousness of bliss burned within him,\r\nthat, in the sightless, motionless village, he seemed to himself to\r\nstand like an altar blazing in the midst of desert Carnac. But he was\r\nnot the only one awake: on the threshold of Peter\u2019s cottage sat his\r\nlittle Phemy, trying to polish a bit of serpentine marble upon the\r\ndoorstep, with the help of water, which stood by her side in a broken\r\ntea-cup.\r\n\r\nShe lifted her sweet gray eyes, and smiled him a welcome.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre ye up a\u2019ready, Phemy?\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CI ha\u2019ena been doon yet,\u201D she answered. \u201CMy mither was oot last nicht\r\nwi\u2019 the boat, an\u2019 Auntie Jinse was wi\u2019 the bairn, an\u2019 sae I cud du as I\r\nlikit.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAn\u2019 what did ye like, Phemy?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA\u2019body kens what I like,\u201D answered the child: \u201CI was oot an\u2019 aboot a\u2019\r\nnicht. An\u2019 eh, Ma\u2019colm! I hed a veesion.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat was that, Phemy?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI was upo\u2019 the tap o\u2019 the Nose, jist as the sun rase, luikin\u2019 aboot\r\nme, an\u2019 awa\u2019 upo\u2019 the Boar\u2019s Tail. I saw twa angels sayin\u2019 their\r\nprayers. Nae doobt they war prayin\u2019 for the haill warl\u2019, i\u2019 the quaiet\r\no\u2019 the mornin\u2019 afore the din begud. Maybe ane o\u2019 them was that auld\r\npriest wi\u2019 the lang name i\u2019 the buik o\u2019 Genesis, \u2019at hed naither father\r\nnor mither--puir man!--him \u2019at gaed aboot blissin\u2019 fowk.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm thought he might take his own time to set the child right, and\r\nasked her to go and tell her father that he wanted to see him. In a few\r\nminutes Blue Peter appeared, rubbing his eyes--one of the dead called\r\ntoo early from the tomb of sleep.\r\n\r\n\u201CFreen\u2019 Peter,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201CI\u2019m gaein\u2019 to speak oot the day.\u201D\r\n\r\nPeter woke up. \u201CWeel,\u201D he said, \u201CI _am_ glaid o\u2019 that, Ma\u2019colm,--I beg\r\nyer pardon--my lord, I sud say.--Annie!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHaud a quaiet sough, man. I wadna hae \u2019t come oot at Scaurnose first.\r\nI\u2019m come noo \u2019cause I want ye to stan\u2019 by me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wull that, my lord.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, gang an\u2019 gether yer boat\u2019s crew, an\u2019 fess them doon to the cove,\r\nan\u2019 I\u2019ll tell them, an\u2019 maybe they\u2019ll stan\u2019 by me as weel.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s little fear o\u2019 that, gien I ken my men,\u201D answered Peter, and\r\nwent off, rather less than half-clothed, the sun burning hot upon his\r\nback, through the sleeping village, to call them, while Malcolm went\r\nand waited beside the dinghy.\r\n\r\nAt length six men in a body, and one lagging behind, appeared coming\r\ndown the winding path--all but Peter no doubt wondering why they were\r\ncalled so soon from their beds, on such a peaceful morning, after being\r\nout the night before. Malcolm went to meet them.\r\n\r\n\u201CFreen\u2019s,\u201D he said, \u201CI\u2019m in want o\u2019 yer help.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COnything ye like, Ma\u2019colm, sae far \u2019s I\u2019m concernt, \u2019cep\u2019 it be to\r\nride yer mere. That I wull no tak in han\u2019,\u201D said Jeames Gentle.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s no that,\u201D returned Malcolm. \u201CIt\u2019s naething freely sae hard \u2019s\r\nthat, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019. The hard\u2019ll be to believe what I\u2019m gaein\u2019 to tell\r\nye.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYe\u2019ll no be gaein\u2019 to set up for a proaphet?\u201D said Girnel, with\r\nsomething approaching a sneer.\r\n\r\nGirnel was the one who came down behind the rest.\r\n\r\n\u201CNa, na; naething like it,\u201D said Blue Peter.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut first ye\u2019ll promise to haud yer tongues for half a day?\u201D said\r\nMalcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, ay; we\u2019ll no clype.\u201D--\u201CWe s\u2019 haud ower tongues,\u201D cried one and\r\nanother and another, and all seemed to assent.\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201CMy name\u2019s no Ma\u2019colm MacPhail, but----\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe a\u2019 ken that,\u201D said Girnel.\r\n\r\n\u201CAn\u2019 what mair du ye ken?\u201D asked Blue Peter, with some anger at his\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\n\u201COw, naething.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, ye ken little,\u201D said Peter, and the rest laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m the Markis o\u2019 Lossie,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\nEvery man but Peter laughed again: all took it for a joke precursive\r\nof some serious announcement. That which it would have least surprised\r\nthem to hear, would have been that he was a natural son of the late\r\nmarquis.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy name\u2019s Ma\u2019colm Colonsay,\u201D resumed Malcolm, quietly; \u201Can\u2019 I\u2019m the\r\nsaxt Markis o\u2019 Lossie.\u201D\r\n\r\nA dead silence followed, and in doubt, astonishment, bewilderment,\r\nand vague awe, accompanied in the case of two or three by a strong\r\ninclination to laugh, with which they struggled, belief began. Always a\r\ncurious observer of humanity, Malcolm calmly watched them. From discord\r\nof expression, most of their faces had grown idiotic. But after a few\r\nmoments of stupefaction, first one and then another turned his eyes\r\nupon Blue Peter, and perceiving that the matter was to him not only\r\nserious but evidently no news, each began to come to his senses, the\r\nchaos within him slowly arranged itself, and his face gradually settled\r\ninto an expression of sanity--the foolishness disappearing while the\r\nwonder and pleasure remained.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe mauna tak it ill, my lord,\u201D said Peter, \u201Cgien the laads be ta\u2019en\r\naback wi\u2019 the news. It\u2019s a some suddent shift o\u2019 the win, ye see, my\r\nlord.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wuss yer lordship weel,\u201D thereupon said one, and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201CLang life to yer lordship,\u201D said another.\r\n\r\nEach spoke a hearty word, and shook hands with him--all except Girnel,\r\nwho held back, looking on, with his right hand in his trouser-pocket.\r\n\r\nHe was one who always took the opposite side-- a tolerably honest and\r\ntrustworthy soul, with a good many knots and pieces of cross grain in\r\nthe timber of him. His old Adam was the most essential and thorough of\r\ndissenters, always arguing and disputing, especially on theological\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\u201CNa,\u201D said Girnel; \u201Cye maun saitisfee me first wha ye are, an\u2019 what ye\r\nwant o\u2019 me. I\u2019m no to be drawn into onything \u2019at I dinna ken a\u2019 aboot\r\naforehan\u2019. I s\u2019 no tie mysel\u2019 up wi\u2019 ony promises. Them \u2019at gangs whaur\r\nthey kenna, may lan\u2019 at the widdie (_gallows_).\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNae doobt,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cyer ain jeedgement\u2019s mair to ye nor my\r\nword, Girnel; but saw ye ever onything in me \u2019at wad justifee ye in no\r\nlippenin\u2019 to that sae far \u2019s it gaed?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COw na! I\u2019m no sayin\u2019 that naither. But what ha\u2019e ye to shaw anent the\r\nprivin\u2019 o\u2019 \u2019t?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have papers signed by my father, the late marquis, and sealed and\r\nwitnessed by well-known gentlemen of the neighbourhood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhaur are they?\u201D said Girnel, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t carry such valuable things about me,\u201D answered Malcolm. \u201CBut\r\nif you go with the rest, you shall see them afterwards.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll du naething i\u2019 the dark,\u201D persisted Girnel. \u201CWhan I see the\r\npeppers, I\u2019ll ken what to du.\u201D\r\n\r\nWith a nod of the head as self-important as decisive, he turned his\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\u201CAt all events,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cyou will say nothing about it before\r\nyou hear from one of us again?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI mak nae promises,\u201D answered Girnel, from behind his own back.\r\n\r\nA howl arose from the rest.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe promised a\u2019ready,\u201D said Blue Peter.\r\n\r\n\u201CNa, I didna that. I said never a word.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat right then had you to remain and listen to my disclosure?\u201D said\r\nMalcolm. \u201CIf you be guilty of such a mean trick as betray me and ruin\r\nmy plans, no honest man in Portlossie or Scaurnose but will scorn you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere! tak ye that!\u201D said Peter. \u201CAn\u2019 I s\u2019 promise ye, ye s\u2019 never lay\r\nleg ower the gunnel o\u2019 _my_ boat again. I s\u2019 hae nane but Christi-an\r\nmen i\u2019 _my_ pey.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYe hired me for the sizon, Blew Peter,\u201D said Girnel, turning defiantly.\r\n\r\n\u201COh! ye s\u2019 ha\u2019e yer wauges. I\u2019m no ane to creep oot o\u2019 a bargain, or\r\nsay \u2019at I didna promise. Ye s\u2019 get yer reward, never fear. But into my\r\nboat ye s\u2019 no come. We\u2019ll ha\u2019e nae Auchans i\u2019 oor camp. Eh, Girnel,\r\nman, but ye ha\u2019e lost yersel\u2019 the day! He\u2019ll never loup far \u2019at winna\r\nlippen. The auld worthies tuik their life i\u2019 their han\u2019, but ye tak yer\r\nfit (_foot_) i\u2019 yours. I\u2019m clean affrontit \u2019at ever I hed ye amo\u2019 my\r\nmen.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut with that there rushed over Peter the recollection of how he had\r\nhimself mistrusted, not Malcolm\u2019s word indeed, but his heart. He\r\nturned, and clasping his hands in sudden self-reproach,\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lord, I saired ye ill mysel\u2019 ance,\u201D he cried; \u201Cfor I misdoobted \u2019at\r\nye wasna the same to me efter ye cam to yer ain. I beg yer pardon, my\r\nlord, here i\u2019 the face o\u2019 my freen\u2019s. It was ill-temper an\u2019 pride i\u2019\r\nme, jist the same as it\u2019s noo in Girnel there; an\u2019 ye maun forgi\u2019e him,\r\nas ye forga\u2019e me, my lord, as sune \u2019s ye can.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll du that, my Peter, the verra moment he wants to be forgi\u2019en,\u201D\r\nsaid Malcolm.\r\n\r\nBut Girnel turned with a grunt, and moved away towards the cliff.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis\u2019ll never du,\u201D said Peter. \u201CA man \u2019at\u2019s honest i\u2019 the main may\r\nplay the verra dog afore he gets the deevil oot o\u2019 \u2019im ance he\u2019s in\r\nlike that. Gang efter \u2019im, laads, an\u2019 kep (_intercept_) \u2019im an\u2019 keep\r\n\u2019im. We\u2019ll ha\u2019e to cast a k-not or twa aboot \u2019im, an\u2019 lay \u2019im i\u2019 the\r\nboddom o\u2019 the boat.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe six had already started after him like one man. But Malcolm cried,\r\n\r\n\u201CLet him go: he has done me no wrong yet, and I don\u2019t believe will do\r\nme any. But for no risk must we prevent wrong with wrong.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo Girnel was allowed to depart--scarcely in peace, for he was already\r\nashamed of himself. With the understanding that they were to be ready\r\nto his call, and that they should hear from him in the course of the\r\nday, Malcolm left them, and rowed back to the Psyche. There he took\r\nhis basket of fish on his arm, which he went and distributed according\r\nto his purpose, ending with Mrs Courthope at the House. Then he fed\r\nand dressed Kelpie, saddled her and galloped to Duff Harbour, where he\r\nfound Mr Soutar at breakfast, and arranged with him to be at Lossie\r\nHouse at two o\u2019clock. On his way back he called on Mr Morrison, and\r\nrequested his presence at the same hour. Skirting the back of the\r\nHouse, and riding as straight as he could, he then made for Scaurnose,\r\nand appointed his friends to be near the House at noon, so placed as\r\nnot to attract observation and yet be within hearing of his whistle\r\nfrom door or window in the front. Returning to the House, he put up\r\nKelpie, rubbed her down and fed her; then, as there was yet some time\r\nto spare, paid a visit to the factor. He found his lady, for all his\r\npresent of fish in the earlier morning, anything but friendly. She did\r\nall she could to humble him; insisted on paying him for the fish; and\r\nordered him, because they smelt of the stable, to take off his boots\r\nbefore he went upstairs--to his master\u2019s room, as she phrased it. But\r\nMr Crathie was cordial, and, to Malcolm\u2019s great satisfaction, much\r\nrecovered. He had better than pleasant talk with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nLIZZY\u2019S BABY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile they were out in the fishing-boat together, Clementina had, with\r\nless difficulty than she had anticipated, persuaded Lizzy to tell Lady\r\nLossie her secret. It was in the hope of an interview with her false\r\nlover that the poor girl had consented so easily.\r\n\r\nA great longing had risen within her to have the father of her child\r\nacknowledge him--only to her, taking him once in his arms. That was\r\nall. She had no hope, thought indeed she had no desire for herself.\r\nBut a kind word to him would be welcome as light. The love that covers\r\nsins had covered the multitude of his, and although hopelessness had\r\nput desire to sleep, she would gladly have given her life for a loving\r\nsmile from him. But mingled with this longing to see him once with\r\nhis child in his arms, a certain loyalty to the house of Lossie also\r\ninfluenced her to listen to the solicitation of Lady Clementina, and\r\ntell the marchioness the truth. She cherished no resentment against\r\nLiftore, but not therefore was she willing to allow a poor young thing\r\nlike Lady Lossie, whom they all liked, to be sacrificed to such a man,\r\nwho would doubtless at length behave badly enough to her also.\r\n\r\nWith trembling hands, and heart now beating wildly, now failing for\r\nfear, she dressed her baby and herself as well as she could, and, about\r\none o\u2019clock, went to the House.\r\n\r\nNow nothing would have better pleased Lady Clementina than that\r\nLiftore and Lizzy should meet in Florimel\u2019s presence, but she recoiled\r\naltogether from the small stratagems, not to mention the lies,\r\nnecessary to the effecting of such a confrontation. So she had to\r\ncontent herself with bringing the two girls together, and, when Lizzy\r\nwas a little rested, and had had a glass of wine, went to look for\r\nFlorimel.\r\n\r\nShe found her in a little room adjoining the library, which, on her\r\nfirst coming to Lossie, she had chosen for her waking nest. Liftore\r\nhad, if not quite the freedom of the spot, yet privileges there; but\r\nat that moment Florimel was alone in it. Clementina informed her that\r\na fisher-girl, with a sad story which she wanted to tell her, had come\r\nto the house; and Florimel, who was not only kind-hearted, but relished\r\nthe position she imagined herself to occupy as lady of the place, at\r\nonce assented to her proposal to bring the young woman to her there.\r\n\r\nNow Florimel and the earl had had a small quarrel the night before,\r\nafter Clementina left the dinner-table, and for the pleasure of keeping\r\nit up Florimel had not appeared at breakfast, and had declined to ride\r\nwith his lordship, who had therefore been all the morning on the watch\r\nfor an opportunity of reconciling himself. It so happened that from the\r\nend of one of the long narrow passages in which the house abounded, he\r\ncaught a glimpse of Clementina\u2019s dress vanishing through the library\r\ndoor, and took the lady for Florimel on her way to her boudoir.\r\n\r\nWhen Clementina entered with Lizzy carrying her child, Florimel\r\ninstantly suspected the truth, both as to who she was and as to the\r\ndesign of her appearance. Her face flushed, for her heart filled with\r\nanger, chiefly indeed against Malcolm, but against the two women as\r\nwell, who, she did not doubt, had lent themselves to his designs,\r\nwhatever they might be. She rose, drew herself up, and stood prepared\r\nto act for both Liftore and herself.\r\n\r\nScarcely however had the poor girl, trembling at the evident\r\ndispleasure the sight of her caused in Florimel, opened her mouth to\r\nanswer her haughty inquiry as to her business, when Lord Liftore,\r\ndaring an entrance without warning, opened the door behind her,\r\nand, almost as he opened it, began his apology. At the sound of\r\nhis voice Lizzy turned with a cry, and her small remaining modicum\r\nof self-possession vanished at sight of him round whose phantom in\r\nher bosom whirred the leaves of her withered life on the stinging\r\nblasts of her shame and sorrow. As much from inability to stand as\r\nin supplication for the coveted favour, she dropped on her knees\r\nbefore him, incapable of uttering a word, but holding up her child\r\nimploringly. Taken altogether by surprise, and not knowing what to say\r\nor do, the earl stood and stared for a moment, then, moved by a dull\r\nspirit of subterfuge, fell back on the pretence of knowing nothing\r\nabout her.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, young woman,\u201D he said, affecting cheerfulness, \u201Cwhat do you want\r\nwith me? I didn\u2019t advertise for a baby. Pretty child, though!\u201D\r\n\r\nLizzy turned white as death, and her whole body seemed to give a heave\r\nof agony. Clementina had just taken the child from her arms when she\r\nsunk motionless at his feet. Florimel went to the bell. But Clementina\r\nprevented her from ringing.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will take her away,\u201D she said. \u201CDo not expose her to your servants.\r\nLady Lossie, my Lord Liftore is the father of this child: and if you\r\ncan marry him after the way you have seen him use its mother, you are\r\nnot too good for him, and I will trouble myself no more about you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI know the author of this calumny!\u201D cried Florimel, panting and\r\nflushed. \u201CYou have been listening to the inventions of an ungrateful\r\ndependent! You slander my guest.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs it a calumny, my lord? Do I slander you?\u201D said Lady Clementina,\r\nturning sharply upon the earl.\r\n\r\nHis lordship made her a cool obeisance.\r\n\r\nClementina ran into the library, laid the child in a big chair, and\r\nreturned for the mother. She was already coming a little to herself;\r\nand feeling about blindly for her baby, while Florimel and Liftore were\r\nlooking out of the window, with their backs towards her. Clementina\r\nraised and led her from the room. But in the doorway she turned and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\u201CGood-bye, Lady Lossie. I thank you for your hospitality, but I can of\r\ncourse be your guest no longer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf course not. There is no occasion for prolonged leave taking,\u201D\r\nreturned Florimel, with the air of a woman of forty.\r\n\r\n\u201CFlorimel, you will curse the day you marry that man!\u201D cried\r\nClementina, and closed the door.\r\n\r\nShe hurried Lizzy to the library, put the baby in her arms, and clasped\r\nthem both in her own. A gush of tears lightened the oppressed heart of\r\nthe mother.\r\n\r\n\u201CLat me oot o\u2019 the hoose, for God\u2019s sake!\u201D she cried; and Clementina,\r\nalmost as anxious to leave it as she, helped her down to the hall. When\r\nshe saw the open door, she rushed out of it as if escaping from the pit.\r\n\r\nNow Malcolm, as he came from the factor\u2019s, had seen her go in with\r\nher baby in her arms, and suspected the hand of Clementina. Wondering\r\nand anxious, but not very hopeful as to what might come of it, he\r\nwaited close by; and when now he saw Lizzy dart from the house in wild\r\nperturbation, he ran from the cover of the surrounding trees into the\r\nopen drive to meet her.\r\n\r\n\u201CMa\u2019colm!\u201D groaned the poor girl, holding out her baby, \u201Che winna own\r\ntill \u2019t. He winna alloo \u2019at he kens oucht aboot me or the bairn aither!\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm had taken the child from her, and was clasping him to his bosom.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s the warst rascal, Lizzy,\u201D he said, \u201C\u2019at ever God made an\u2019 the\r\ndeevil blaudit.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNa, na,\u201D cried Lizzy; \u201Cthe likes o\u2019 him whiles kills the wuman, but he\r\nwadna du that. Na, he\u2019s nae the warst; there\u2019s a heap waur nor him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDid ye see my mistress?\u201D asked Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201COw ay; but she luikit sae angry at me, I cudna speyk. Him an\u2019 her \u2019s\r\nower thrang for her to believe onything again\u2019 him. An\u2019 what ever the\r\nbairn\u2019s to du wantin\u2019 a father!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLizzy,\u201D said Malcolm, clasping the child again to his bosom. \u201CI s\u2019 be\r\na father to yer bairn--that is, as weel \u2019s ane \u2019at\u2019s no yer man can be.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd he kissed the child tenderly.\r\n\r\nThe same moment an undefined impulse--the drawing of eyes probably\r\n--made him lift his towards the house: half leaning from the open\r\nwindow of the boudoir above him, stood Florimel and Liftore; and just\r\nas he looked up, Liftore was turning to Florimel with a smile that\r\nseemed to say--\u201CThere! I told you so! He is the father himself.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm replaced the infant in his mother\u2019s arm, and strode towards the\r\nhouse. Imagining he went to avenge her wrongs, Lizzy ran after him.\r\n\r\n\u201CMa\u2019colm! Ma\u2019colm!\u201D she cried; \u201C--for my sake!--He\u2019s the father o\u2019 my\r\nbairn!\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm turned.\r\n\r\n\u201CLizzy,\u201D he said solemnly, \u201CI winna lay han\u2019 upon \u2019im.\u201D\r\n\r\nLizzy pressed her child closer with a throb of relief.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome in yersel\u2019 an\u2019 see,\u201D he added.\r\n\r\n\u201CI daurna! I daurna!\u201D she said. But she lingered about the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nTHE DISCLOSURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the earl saw Malcolm coming, although he was no coward, and had\r\nreason to trust his skill, yet knowing himself both in the wrong and\r\nvastly inferior in strength to his enemy, it may be pardoned him that\r\nfor the next few seconds his heart doubled its beats. But of all things\r\nhe must not show fear before Florimel!\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat can the fellow be after now?\u201D he said. \u201CI must go down to him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no; don\u2019t go near him--he may be violent,\u201D objected Florimel, and\r\nlaid her hand on his arm with a beseeching look in her face. \u201CHe is a\r\ndangerous man.\u201D\r\n\r\nLiftore laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201CStop here till I return,\u201D he said, and left the room.\r\n\r\nBut Florimel followed, fearful of what might happen, and enraged with\r\nher brother.\r\n\r\nMalcolm\u2019s brief detention by Lizzy gave Liftore a little advantage,\r\nfor just as Malcolm approached the top of the great staircase,\r\nLiftore gained it. Hastening to secure the command of the position,\r\nand resolved to shun all parley, he stood ready to strike. Malcolm,\r\nhowever, caught sight of him and his attitude in time, and, fearful of\r\nbreaking his word to Lizzy, pulled himself up abruptly a few steps from\r\nthe top--just as Florimel appeared.\r\n\r\n\u201CMacPhail,\u201D she said, sweeping to the stair like an indignant goddess,\r\n\u201CI discharge you from my service. Leave the house instantly.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm turned, flew down, and ran to the servants\u2019 stair half the\r\nlength of the house away. As he crossed the servants\u2019 hall he saw Rose.\r\nShe was the only one in the house except Clementina to whom he could\r\nlook for help.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome after me, Rose,\u201D he said without stopping.\r\n\r\nShe followed instantly, as fast as she could run, and saw him enter the\r\ndrawing-room. Florimel and Liftore were there. The earl had Florimel\u2019s\r\nhand in his.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor God\u2019s sake, my lady!\u201D cried Malcolm, \u201Chear me one word before you\r\npromise that man anything.\u201D\r\n\r\nHis lordship started back from Florimel, and turned upon Malcolm in a\r\nfury. But he had not now the advantage of the stair, and hesitated.\r\nFlorimel\u2019s eyes dilated with wrath.\r\n\r\n\u201CI tell you for the last time, my lady,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cif you marry\r\nthat man, you will marry a liar and a scoundrel.\u201D\r\n\r\nLiftore laughed, and his imitation of scorn was wonderfully successful,\r\nfor he felt sure of Florimel, now that she had thus taken his part.\r\n\r\n\u201CShall I ring for the servants, Lady Lossie, to put the fellow out?\u201D he\r\nsaid. \u201CThe man is as mad as a March hare.\u201D\r\n\r\nMeantime Lady Clementina, her maid having gone to send her man to get\r\nhorses for her at once, was alone in her room, which was close to the\r\ndrawing-room: hearing Malcolm\u2019s voice, she ran to the door, and saw\r\nRose in a listening attitude at that of the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat are you doing there?\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CMr MacPhail told me to follow him, my lady, and I am waiting here till\r\nhe wants me.\u201D\r\n\r\nClementina went into the drawing-room, and was present during all\r\nthat now follows. Lizzy also, hearing loud voices and still afraid of\r\nmischief, had come peering up the stair, and now approached the other\r\ndoor, behind Florimel and the earl.\r\n\r\n\u201CSo!\u201D cried Florimel, \u201Cthis is the way you keep your promise to my\r\nfather!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is, my lady. To associate the name of Liftore with his would be to\r\nblot the scutcheon of Lossie. He is not fit to walk the street with\r\nmen: his touch is to you an utter degradation. My lady, in the name of\r\nyour father, I beg a word with you in private.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou insult me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI beg of you, my lady--for your own dear sake.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COnce more I order you to leave my house, and never set foot in it\r\nagain.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou hear her ladyship?\u201D cried Liftore. \u201CGet out.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe approached threateningly.\r\n\r\n\u201CStand back,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CIf it were not that I promised the poor\r\ngirl carrying your baby out there, I should soon----\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was unwisely said: the earl came on the bolder. For all Malcolm\r\ncould do to parry, evade, or stop his blows, he had soon taken several\r\npretty severe ones. Then came the voice of Lizzy in an agony from the\r\ndoor--\r\n\r\n\u201CHaud aff o\u2019 yersel\u2019, Ma\u2019colm. I canna bide it. I gi\u2019e ye back yer\r\nword.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll manage yet Lizzy,\u201D answered Malcolm, and kept warily retreating\r\ntowards a window. Suddenly he dashed his elbow through a pane, and gave\r\na loud shrill whistle, the same instant receiving a blow over the eye\r\nwhich the blood followed. Lizzy made a rush forward, but the terror\r\nthat the father would strike the child he had disowned, seized her, and\r\nshe stood trembling. Already, however, Clementina and Rose had darted\r\nbetween, and, full of rage as he was, Liftore was compelled to restrain\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\u201COh!\u201D he said, \u201Cif ladies want a share in the row, I must yield my\r\nplace,\u201D and drew back.\r\n\r\nThe few men servants now came hurrying all together into the room.\r\n\r\n\u201CTake that rascal there, and put him under the pump,\u201D said Liftore. \u201CHe\r\nis mad.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy fellow-servants know better than touch me,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\nThe men looked to their mistress.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo as my lord tells you,\u201D she said, \u201C--and instantly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMen,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201CI have spared that foolish lord there for the\r\nsake of this fisher-girl and his child, but don\u2019t one of _you_ touch\r\nme.\u201D\r\n\r\nStoat was a brave enough man, and not a little jealous of Malcolm, but\r\nhe dared not obey his mistress.\r\n\r\nAnd now came the tramp of many feet along the landing from the\r\nstair-head, and the six fisherman entered, two and two. Florimel\r\nstarted forward.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy brave fisherman!\u201D she cried. \u201CTake that bad man MacPhail, and put\r\nhim out of my grounds.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI canna du \u2019t, my leddy,\u201D answered their leader.\r\n\r\n\u201CTake Lord Liftore,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cand hold him, while I make him\r\nacquainted with a fact or two which he may judge of consequence to him.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe men walked straight up to the earl. He struck right and left, but\r\nwas overpowered in a moment, and held fast.\r\n\r\n\u201CStan\u2019 still,\u201D said Peter, \u201Cor I ha\u2019e a han\u2019-fu\u2019 o\u2019 twine i\u2019 my pooch\r\n\u2019at I\u2019ll jist cast a k-not aboot yer airms wi\u2019 in a jiffey.\u201D\r\n\r\nHis lordship stood still, muttering curses.\r\n\r\nThen Malcolm stepped into the middle of the room approaching his sister.\r\n\r\n\u201CI tell you to leave the house,\u201D Florimel shrieked, beside herself with\r\nfury, yet pale as marble with a growing terror for which she could ill\r\nhave accounted.\r\n\r\n\u201CFlorimel!\u201D said Malcolm solemnly, calling his sister by name for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou insolent wretch!\u201D she cried, panting. \u201CWhat right have you, if you\r\n_be_, as you say, my base-born brother, to call me by my name.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFlorimel!\u201D repeated Malcolm, and the voice was like the voice of her\r\nfather, \u201CI have done what I could to serve you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd I want no more such service!\u201D she returned, beginning to tremble.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you have driven me almost to extremities,\u201D he went on, heedless of\r\nher interruption. \u201CBeware of doing so quite.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWill nobody take pity on me?\u201D said Florimel, and looked round\r\nimploringly. Then, finding herself ready to burst into tears, she\r\ngathered all her pride, and stepping up to Malcolm, looked him in the\r\nface, and said,\r\n\r\n\u201CPray, sir! is this house yours or mine?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMine,\u201D answered Malcolm. \u201CI am the Marquis of Lossie, and while I am\r\nyour elder brother and the head of the family, you shall never with my\r\nconsent marry that base man--a man it would blast me to the soul to\r\ncall brother.\u201D\r\n\r\nLiftore uttered a fierce imprecation.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you dare give breath to another such word in my sister\u2019s presence,\r\nI will have you gagged,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CIf my sister marries him,\u201D he\r\ncontinued, turning again to Florimel, \u201Cnot one shilling shall she take\r\nwith her beyond what she may happen to have in her purse at the moment.\r\nShe is in my power, and I will use it to the utmost to protect her from\r\nthat man.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CProof!\u201D cried Liftore sullenly. But Florimel gazed with pale dilated\r\neyes in the face of the speaker. She knew his words were true. Her soul\r\nassured her of it.\r\n\r\n\u201CTo my sister,\u201D answered Malcolm, \u201CI will give all the proof she may\r\nplease to require; to Lord Liftore I will not even repeat my assertion.\r\nTo him I will give no shadow of proof. I will but cast him out of my\r\nhouse. Stoat, order horses for Lady Bellair.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGien ye please, sir, my Lord,\u201D replied Stoat, \u201Cthe Lossie Airms horses\r\nis ordered a\u2019ready for Lady Clementina.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWill my Lady Clementina oblige me by yielding her horses to Lady\r\nBellair?\u201D said Malcolm, turning to her.\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly, my lord,\u201D answered Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou, I trust, my lady,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cwill stay a little longer with\r\nmy sister.\u201D\r\n\r\nLady Bellair came up.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lord,\u201D she said, \u201Cis this the marquis or the fisherman\u2019s way of\r\ntreating a lady?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNeither. But do not drive me to give the rein to my tongue. Let it be\r\nenough to say that my house shall never be what your presence would\r\nmake it.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe turned to the fishermen.\r\n\r\n\u201CThree of you take that lord to the town-gate, and leave him on the\r\nother side of it. His servant shall follow as soon as the horses come.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will go with you,\u201D said Florimel, crossing to Lady Bellair.\r\n\r\nMalcolm took her by the arm. For one moment she struggled, but finding\r\nno one dared interfere, submitted, and was led from the room like a\r\nnaughty child.\r\n\r\n\u201CKeep my lord there till I return,\u201D he said as he went.\r\n\r\nHe led her into the room which had been her mother\u2019s boudoir, and when\r\nhe had shut the door,\r\n\r\n\u201CFlorimel,\u201D he said, \u201CI have striven to serve you the best way I knew.\r\nYour father, when he confessed me his heir, begged me to be good to\r\nyou, and I promised him. Would I have given all these months of my life\r\nto the poor labour of a groom, allowed my people to be wronged and\r\noppressed, my grandfather to be a wanderer, and my best friend to sit\r\nwith his lips of wisdom sealed, but for your sake? I can hardly say it\r\nwas for my father\u2019s sake, for I should have done the same had he never\r\nsaid a word about you. Florimel, I loved my sister, and longed for her\r\ngoodness. But she has foiled all my endeavours. She has not loved or\r\nfollowed the truth. She has been proud and disdainful, and careless of\r\nright. Yourself young and pure, and naturally recoiling from evil, you\r\nhave yet cast from you the devotion of a noble, gifted, large-hearted,\r\nand great-souled man, for the miserable preference of the smallest,\r\nmeanest, vilest of men. Nor that only! for with him you have sided\r\nagainst the woman he most bitterly wrongs: and therein you wrong the\r\nnature and the God of women. Once more, I pray you to give up this man;\r\nto let your true self speak and send him away.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSir, I go with my Lady Bellair, driven from her father\u2019s house by one\r\nwho calls himself my brother. My lawyer shall make inquiries.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe would have left the room, but he intercepted her.\r\n\r\n\u201CFlorimel,\u201D he said, \u201Cyou are casting the pearl of your womanhood\r\nbefore a swine. He will trample it under his feet and turn again and\r\nrend you. He will treat you worse still than poor Lizzy, whom he\r\ntroubles no more with his presence.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe had again taken her arm in his great grasp.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet me go. You are brutal. I shall scream.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou shall not go until you have heard all the truth.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat! more truth still? Your truth is anything but pleasant.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is more unpleasant yet than you surmise. Florimel, you have driven\r\nme to it. I would have prepared you a shield against the shock which\r\nmust come, but you compel me to wound you to the quick. I would have\r\nhad you receive the bitter truth from lips you loved, but you drove\r\nthose lips of honour from you, and now there are left to utter it only\r\nthe lips you hate; yet the truth you shall receive: it may help to save\r\nyou from weakness, arrogance, and falsehood.--Sister, your mother was\r\nnever Lady Lossie.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou lie. I know you lie. Because you wrong me, you would brand me with\r\ndishonour, to take from me as well the sympathy of the world. But I\r\ndefy you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAlas! there is no help, sister. Your mother indeed passed as Lady\r\nLossie, but my mother, the true Lady Lossie, was alive all the time,\r\nand in truth, died only last year. For twenty years my mother suffered\r\nfor yours in the eye of the law. You are no better than the little\r\nchild his father denied in your presence. Give that man his dismissal,\r\nor he will give you yours. Never doubt it. Refuse again, and I go from\r\nthis room to publish in the next the fact that you are neither Lady\r\nLossie nor Lady Florimel Colonsay. You have no right to any name but\r\nyour mother\u2019s. You are Miss Gordon.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe gave a great gasp at the word, but bravely fought the horror that\r\nwas taking possession of her. She stood with one hand on the back of a\r\nchair, her face white, her eyes starting, her mouth a little open and\r\nrigid--her whole appearance, except for the breath that came short and\r\nquick, that of one who had died in sore pain.\r\n\r\n\u201CAll that is now left you,\u201D concluded Malcolm, \u201Cis the choice between\r\nsending Liftore away, and being abandoned by him. That choice you must\r\nnow make.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe poor girl tried to speak, but could not. Her fire was burning out,\r\nher forced strength fast failing her.\r\n\r\n\u201CFlorimel,\u201D said Malcolm, and knelt on one knee and took her hand. It\r\ngave a flutter as if it would fly like a bird; but the net of his love\r\nheld it, and it lay passive and cold. \u201CFlorimel, I will be your true\r\nbrother. I _am_ your brother, your very own brother, to live for you,\r\nlove you, fight for you, watch and ward you, till a true man takes you\r\nfor his wife.\u201D Her hand quivered like a leaf. \u201CSister, when you and I\r\nappear before our father, I shall hold up my face before him: will you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSend him away,\u201D she breathed rather than said, and sank on the floor.\r\nHe lifted her, laid her on a couch, and returned to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady Clementina,\u201D he said, \u201Cwill you oblige me by going to my\r\nsister in the room at the top of the stair?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will, my lord,\u201D she answered, and went.\r\n\r\nMalcolm walked up to Liftore.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lord,\u201D he said, \u201Cmy sister takes leave of you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI must have my dismissal from her own lips.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou shall have it from the hands of my fishermen. Take him away.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou shall hear from me, my lord marquis, if such you be,\u201D said Liftore.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet it be of your repentance, then, my lord,\u201D said Malcolm. \u201CThat I\r\nshall be glad to hear of.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he turned from him, he saw Caley gliding through the little group of\r\nservants towards the door. He walked after her, laid his hand on her\r\nshoulder, and whispered a word in her ear, she grew gray rather than\r\nwhite, and stood still.\r\n\r\nTurning again to go to Florimel, he saw the fishermen stopped with\r\ntheir charge in the doorway by Mr Morrison and Mr Soutar, entering\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lord! my lord!\u201D said the lawyer, coming hastily up to him, \u201Cthere\r\ncan be surely no occasion for such--such--measures!\u201D\r\n\r\nCatching sight of Malcolm\u2019s wounded forehead, however, he supplemented\r\nthe remark with a low exclamation of astonishment and dismay-- the tone\r\nsaying almost as clearly as words, \u201CHow ill and foolishly everything is\r\nmanaged without a lawyer!\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm only smiled, and went up to the magistrate, whom he led into\r\nthe middle of the room, saying,\r\n\r\n\u201CMr Morrison, every one here knows you: tell them who I am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Marquis of Lossie, my lord,\u201D answered Mr Morrison; \u201Cand from my\r\nheart I congratulate your people that at length you assume the rights\r\nand honours of your position.\u201D\r\n\r\nA murmur of pleasure arose in response. Ere it ceased, Malcolm started\r\nand sprung to the door. There stood Lenorme! He seized him by the arm,\r\nand, without a word of explanation, hurried him to the room where his\r\nsister was. He called Clementina, drew her from the room, half pushed\r\nLenorme in, and closed the door.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you meet me on the sand-hill at sunset, my lady?\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nShe smiled assent. He gave her the key of the tunnel, hinted that she\r\nmight leave the two to themselves for awhile, and returned to his\r\nfriends in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nHaving begged them to excuse him for a little while, and desired Mrs\r\nCourthope to serve luncheon for them, he ran to his grandfather,\r\ndreading lest any other tongue than his own should yield him the opened\r\nsecret. He was but just in time, for already the town was in a tumult,\r\nand the spreading ripples of the news were fast approaching Duncan\u2019s\r\nears.\r\n\r\nMalcolm found him, expectant and restless. When he disclosed himself,\r\nhe manifested little astonishment, only took him in his arms and\r\npressed him to his bosom, saying, \u201CTa Lort pe praised, my son! and\r\nshe wouldn\u2019t pe at aal surprised.\u201D Then he broke out in a fervent\r\nejaculation of Gaelic, during which he turned instinctively to his\r\npipes, for through them lay the final and only sure escape for the\r\nprisoned waters of the overcharged reservoir of his feelings. While he\r\nplayed, Malcolm slipped out, and hurried to Miss Horn.\r\n\r\nOne word to her was enough. The stern old woman burst into tears,\r\ncrying,\r\n\r\n\u201COh, my Grisel! my Grisel! Luik doon frae yer bonny hoose amo\u2019 the\r\nstars, an\u2019 see the braw laad left ahint ye, an\u2019 praise the lord \u2019at ye\r\nha\u2019e sic a son o\u2019 yer boady to come hame to ye whan a\u2019 \u2019s ower.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe sobbed and wept for a while without restraint. Then suddenly she\r\nrose, dabbed her eyes indignantly, and cried,\r\n\r\n\u201CHoot! I\u2019m an auld fule. A body wad think I hed feelin\u2019s efter a\u2019!\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm laughed, and she could not help joining him.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe maun come the morn an\u2019 chise yer ain room i\u2019 the Hoose,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat mean ye by that, laddie?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAt ye\u2019ll ha\u2019e to come an\u2019 bide wi\u2019 me noo.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Deed an\u2019 I s\u2019 du naething o\u2019 the kin\u2019, Ma\u2019colm! H\u2019ard ever onybody\r\nsic nonsense! What wad I du wi\u2019 Jean? An\u2019 I cudna thole men-fowk to\r\nwait upo\u2019 me. I wad be clean affrontit.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWeel, weel! we\u2019ll see,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\nOn his way back to the House, he knocked at Mrs Catanach\u2019s door, and\r\nsaid a few words to her which had a remarkable effect on the expression\r\nof her plump countenance and deep-set black eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached home, he ran up the main staircase, knocked at the\r\nfirst door, opened it, and peeped in. There sat Lenorme on the couch,\r\nwith Florimel on his knees, nestling her head against his shoulder,\r\nlike a child that had been very naughty but was fully forgiven. Her\r\nface was blotted with her tears, and her hair was everywhere; but there\r\nwas a light of dawning goodness all about her, such as had never shone\r\nin her atmosphere before. By what stormy-sweet process the fountain of\r\nthis light had been unsealed, no one ever knew but themselves.\r\n\r\nShe did not move when Malcolm entered--more than just to bring the\r\npalms of her hands together, and look up in his face.\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you told him _all_, Florimel?\u201D he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, Malcolm,\u201D she answered. \u201CTell him again yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, Florimel. Once is enough.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI told him _all_,\u201D she said with a gasp; then gave a wild little cry,\r\nand, with subdued exultation, added, \u201Cand he _loves_ me yet! He has\r\ntaken the girl without a name to his heart!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo wonder,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201Cwhen she brought it with her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Lenorme, \u201CI but took the diamond casket that held my bliss,\r\nand now I could dare the angel Gabriel to match happinesses with me.\u201D\r\n\r\nPoor Florimel, for all her worldly ways, was but a child. Bad\r\nassociates had filled her with worldly maxims and words and thoughts\r\nand judgments. She had never loved Liftore, she had only taken\r\ndelight in his flatteries. And now had come the shock of a terrible\r\ndisclosure, whose significance she read in remembered looks and tones\r\nand behaviours of the world. Her insolence to Malcolm when she supposed\r\nhis the nameless fate, had recoiled in lurid interpretation of her\r\nown. She was a pariah--without root, without descent, without fathers\r\nto whom to be gathered. She was nobody. From the courted and flattered\r\nand high-seated and powerful, she was a nobody! Then suddenly to this\r\npoor houseless, wind-beaten, rain-wet nobody, a house--no, a home\r\nshe had once looked into with longing, had opened, and received her\r\nto its heart, that it might be fulfilled which was written of old,\r\n\u201CA man shall be as an hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from\r\nthe tempest.\u201D Knowing herself a nobody, she now first began to be a\r\nsomebody. She had been dreaming pleasant but bad dreams: she woke, and\r\nhere was a lovely, unspeakably blessed and good reality, which had been\r\nwaiting for her all the time on the threshold of her sleep! She was\r\nbaptized into it with the tears of sorrow and shame. She had been a\r\nfool, but now she knew it, and was going to be wise.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you come to your brother, Florimel?\u201D said Malcolm tenderly,\r\nholding out his arms.\r\n\r\nLenorme raised her. She went softly to him, and laid herself on his\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n\u201CForgive me, brother,\u201D she said, and held up her face.\r\n\r\nHe kissed her forehead and lips, took her in his arms, and laid her\r\nagain on Lenorme\u2019s knees.\r\n\r\n\u201CI give her to _you_,\u201D he said, \u201Cfor you are good.\u201D\r\n\r\nWith that he left them, and sought Mr Morrison and Mr Soutar, who were\r\nwaiting him over a glass of wine after their lunch. An hour of business\r\nfollowed, in which, amongst other matters, they talked about the\r\nneedful arrangements for a dinner to his people, fishers and farmers\r\nand all.\r\n\r\nAfter the gentlemen took their leave, nobody saw him for hours. Till\r\nsunset approached he remained alone, shut up in the Wizard\u2019s Chamber,\r\nthe room in which he was born. Part of the time he occupied in writing\r\nto Mr Graham.\r\n\r\nAs the sun\u2019s orbed furnace fell behind the tumbling waters, Malcolm\r\nturned his face inland from the wet strip of shining shore on which he\r\nhad been pacing, and ascended the sandhill.\r\n\r\nFrom the other side Clementina, but a moment later, ascended also. On\r\nthe top they met, in the red light of the sunset. They clasped each the\r\nother\u2019s hand, and stood for a moment in silence.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, my lord!\u201D said the lady, \u201Chow shall I thank you that you kept your\r\nsecret from me! But my heart is sore to lose my fisherman.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lady,\u201D returned Malcolm, \u201Cyou have not lost your fisherman; you\r\nhave only found your groom.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd the sun went down, and the twilight came, and the night followed,\r\nand the world of sea and land and wind and vapour was around them, and\r\nthe universe of stars and spaces over and under them, and eternity\r\nwithin them, and the heart of each for a chamber to the other, and God\r\nfilling all--nay, nay--God\u2019s heart containing, infolding, cherishing\r\nall--saving all, from height to height of intensest being, by the bliss\r\nof that love whose absolute devotion could utter itself only in death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE ASSEMBLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same evening, Duncan, in full dress, claymore and dirk at his\r\nsides, and carrying the great Lossie pipes, marched first through\r\nthe streets of the upper, then through the closes of the lower\r\ntown, followed by the bellman who had been appointed crier upon his\r\ndisappearance. At the proper stations, Duncan blew a rousing pibroch,\r\nafter which the bellman, who, for the dignity of his calling, insisted\r\non a prelude of three strokes of his clapper, proclaimed aloud that\r\nMalcolm, Marquis of Lossie, desired the presence of each and every of\r\nhis tenants in the royal burgh of Portlossie, Newton and Seaton, in\r\nthe town-hall of the same, at seven of the clock upon the evening next\r\nfollowing. The proclamation ended, the piper sounded one note three\r\ntimes, and they passed to the next station. When they had gone through\r\nthe Seaton, they entered a carriage waiting for them at the sea-gate,\r\nand were driven to Scaurnose, and thence again to the several other\r\nvillages on the coast belonging to the marquis, making at each in like\r\nmanner the same announcement.\r\n\r\nPortlossie was in a ferment of wonder, satisfaction, and pleasure.\r\nThere were few in it who were not glad at the accession of Malcolm,\r\nand with every one of those few the cause lay in himself. In the\r\nshops, among the nets, in the curing-sheds, in the houses and\r\ncottages, nothing else was talked about; and stories and reminiscences\r\ninnumerable were brought out, chiefly to prove that Malcolm had always\r\nappeared likely to turn out somebody, the narrator not seldom modestly\r\nhinting at a glimmering foresight on his own part of what had now\r\nbeen at length revealed to the world. His friends were jubilant as\r\nrevellers. For Meg Partan, she ran from house to house like a maniac,\r\nlaughing and crying. It was as if the whole Seaton had suddenly been\r\ntranslated. The men came crowding about Duncan, congratulating him and\r\nasking him a hundred questions. But the old man maintained a reticence\r\nwhose dignity was strangely mingled of pomp and grace; sat calm and\r\nstately as feeling the glow of reflected honour; would not, by word,\r\ngesture, tone, or exclamation, confess to any surprise; behaved as if\r\nhe had known it all the time; made no pretence however of having known\r\nit, merely treated the fact as not a whit more than might have been\r\nlooked for by one who had known Malcolm as he had known him.\r\n\r\nDavy, in his yacht uniform, was the next morning appointed the\r\nmarquis\u2019s personal attendant, and a running time he had of it for a\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\nAlmost the first thing that fell to him in his office was to show into\r\nthe room on the ground floor where his master sat--the same in which\r\nfor ages the lords of Lossie had been wont to transact what little\r\nbusiness any of them ever attended to--a pale, feeble man, bowed by the\r\nweight of a huge brass-clasped volume under each arm. His lordship rose\r\nand met him with out-stretched hand.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am glad indeed to see you, Mr Crathie,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut I fear you are\r\nout too soon.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am quite well since yesterday, my lord,\u201D returned the factor, his\r\nface shining with pleasure. \u201CYour lordship\u2019s accession has made a young\r\nman of me again. Here I am to render account of my stewardship.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI want none, Mr Crathie--nothing, that is, beyond a summary statement\r\nof how things stand with me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI should like to satisfy your lordship that I have dealt honestly\u201D--\r\nhere the factor paused for a moment, then with an effort added --\u201Cby\r\n_you_, my lord.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COne word,\u201D said Malcolm \u201C--the last of the sort, I believe, that\r\nwill ever pass between us. Thank God! we had made it up before\r\nyesterday.--If you have ever been hard upon any of my tenants, not to\r\nsay unfair, you have wronged me infinitely more than if you had taken\r\nfrom me. God be with me as I prefer ruin to wrong. Remember, besides,\r\nthat my tenants are my charge and care. For you, my representative,\r\ntherefore, to do one of them an injury is to do me a double injury--to\r\nwrong my tenant, and to wrong him in my name.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, my lord! you don\u2019t know how they would take advantage of you, if\r\nthere were nobody to look after your interests.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen do look after them, sir. It would be bad for them to succeed,\r\nas well as crippling to me. Only be sure, with the thought of the\r\nrighteous God to elevate your sense of justice, that you are in the\r\nright. If doubtful, then give in.--And now, if any man thinks he has\r\ncause of complaint, I leave it to you, with the help of the new light\r\nthat has been given you, to reconsider the matter, and, where needful,\r\nto make reparation. You must be the friend of my tenant as much as of\r\nhis landlord. I have no interests inimical to those of my tenants. If\r\nany man comes to me with complaint, I will send him to restate his case\r\nto you, with the understanding that, if you will not listen to him, he\r\nis to come to me again, when I shall hear both sides and judge between.\r\nIf after six months you should desire me to go over the books with you,\r\nI will do so. As to your loyalty to my family and its affairs, of that\r\nI never had a shadow of suspicion.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he ended, Malcolm held out his hand. The factor\u2019s trembled in his\r\nstrong grasp.\r\n\r\n\u201CMistress Crathie is sorely vexed, my lord,\u201D he said, rising to take\r\nhis leave, \u201Cat things both said and done in the dark.\u201D\r\n\r\nMalcolm laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive Mrs Crathie my compliments,\u201D he said, \u201Cand tell her a man is more\r\nthan a marquis. If she will after this treat every honest fisherman\r\nas if he might possibly turn out a lord, she and I shall be more than\r\nquits.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe next morning he carried her again a few mackerel he had just\r\ncaught, and she never forgot the lesson given her. That morning, I may\r\nmention, he did not go fishing alone, but had a lady with him in the\r\ndinghy; and indeed they were together, in one place and another, the\r\nmost of the day--at one time flying along the fields, she on the bay\r\nmare, and he on Kelpie.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening came, the town-hall was crammed--men standing on all\r\nthe window-sills; and so many could not get in that Malcolm proposed\r\nthey should occupy the square in front. A fisherman in garb and\r\ngesture, not the less a gentleman and a marquis, he stood on the steps\r\nof the town-hall and spoke to his people. They received him with wild\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe open air is better for everything,\u201D he began. \u201CFishers, I have\r\ncalled you first, because you are my own people. I am, and shall be\r\na fisherman, after such fashion, I trust, as will content my old\r\ncomrades. How things have come about, I shall not now tell you. Come\r\nall of you and dine with me, and you shall hear enough to satisfy\r\nat least lawful curiosity. At present my care is that you should\r\nunderstand the terms upon which it is possible for us to live together\r\nas friends. I make no allusion to personal friendships. A true friend\r\nis for ever a friend. And I venture to say my old friends know best\r\nboth what I am and what I shall be. As to them I have no shadow\r\nof anxiety. But I would gladly be a friend to all, and will do my\r\nendeavour to that end.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou of Portlossie shall have your harbour cleared without delay.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn justice to the fishers I here interrupt my report to state that the\r\nvery next day they set about clearing the harbour themselves. It was\r\ntheir business--in part at least, they said, and they were ashamed of\r\nhaving left it so long. This did much towards starting well for a new\r\norder of things.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou of Scaurnose shall hear the blasting necessary for your harbour\r\ncommence within a fortnight; and every house shall ere long have a\r\nsmall piece of land at a reasonable rate allotted to it. But I feel\r\nbound to mention that there are some among you upon whom, until I see\r\nthat they carry themselves differently, I must keep an eye. That they\r\nhave shown themselves unfriendly to myself in my attempts to persuade\r\nthem to what they knew to be right, I shall endeavour to forget, but\r\nI give them warning that whoever shall hereafter disturb the peace or\r\ninterfere with the liberty of my people, shall assuredly be cast out of\r\nmy borders, and that as soon as the law will permit.\r\n\r\n\u201CI shall take measures that all complaints shall be heard, and all save\r\nfoolish ones heeded; for, as much as in me lies, I will to execute\r\njustice and judgment and righteousness in the land. Whoever oppresses\r\nor wrongs his neighbour shall have to do with me. And to aid me in\r\ndoing justice, I pray the help of every honest man. I have not been so\r\nlong among you without having in some measure distinguished between\r\nthe men who have heart and brain, and the men who have merely a sense\r\nof their own importance--which latter class, unhappily, always takes\r\nitself for the former. I will deal with every man as I find him. I am\r\nset to rule, and rule I will. He who loves righteousness, will help me\r\nto rule; he who loves it not, shall be ruled, or depart.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe address had been every now and then interrupted by a hearty cheer;\r\nat this point the cheering was greatly prolonged; after it there was no\r\nmore. For thus he went on:\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd now I am about to give you proof that I mean what I say, and that\r\nevil shall not come to the light without being noted and dealt with.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere are in this company two women--my eyes are at this moment upon\r\nthem where they stand together. One of them is already well-known to\r\nyou all by sight: now you shall know, not what she looks, but what she\r\nis. Her name, or at least that by which she goes among you, is Barbara\r\nCatanach. The other is an Englishwoman of whom you know nothing. Her\r\nname is Caley.\u201D\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned upon the two. Even Mrs Catanach was cowed by the\r\nconsciousness of the universal stare, and a kind of numb thrill went\r\nthrough her from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell assured that, if I brought a criminal action against them, it\r\nwould hang them both, I trust you will not imagine it revenge that\r\nmoves me thus to expose them. In refraining from prosecuting them,\r\nI bind myself of necessity to see that they work no more evil. In\r\ngiving them time for repentance, I take the consequences upon myself.\r\nI am bound to take care that they do not employ the respite in doing\r\nmischief to their neighbours. Without precaution I could not be\r\njustified in sparing them. Therefore those women shall not go forth\r\nto pass for harmless members of society, and see the life and honour\r\nof others lie bare to their secret attack. They shall live _here_, in\r\nthis town, thoroughly known; and absolutely distrusted. And that they\r\nmay thus be known and distrusted, I publicly declare that I hold proof\r\nagainst these women of having conspired to kill me. From the effects of\r\nthe poison they succeeded in giving me, I fear I shall never altogether\r\nrecover. I can prove also, to the extreme of circumstantial evidence,\r\nthat there is the blood of one child at least upon the hands of each;\r\nand that there are mischiefs innumerable upon their lying tongues, it\r\nwere an easy task to convince you. If I wrong them, let them accuse\r\nme; and whether they lose or gain their suit, I promise before you for\r\nwitnesses, I will pay all; only thereby they will compel me to bring my\r\nactions for murder and conspiracy. Let them choose.\r\n\r\n\u201CHear what I have determined concerning them. The woman Catanach shall\r\ntake to her cottage the woman Caley. That cottage they shall have rent\r\nfree: who could receive money from such hands? I will appoint them also\r\na sufficiency for life and maintenance, bare indeed, for I would not\r\nhave them comfortable. But they shall be free to work if they can find\r\nany to employ them. If, however, either shall go beyond the bounds I\r\nset, she shall be followed the moment she is missed, and that with a\r\nwarrant for her apprehension. And I beg all honest people to keep an\r\neye upon them. According as they live shall their life be. If they come\r\nto repentance, they will bless the day I resolved upon such severe\r\nmeasures on their behalf. Let them go to their place.\u201D\r\n\r\nI will not try to describe the devilish look, mingled of contempt and\r\nhate, that possessed the countenance of the midwife, as, with head\r\nerect, and eyes looking straight before her, she obeyed the command.\r\nCaley, white as death, trembled and tottered, nor dared once look up\r\nas she followed her companion to their appointed hell. Whether they\r\nmade it pleasant for each other my reader may debate with himself.\r\nBefore many months had gone by, stared at and shunned by all, even by\r\nMiss Horn\u2019s Jean, driven back upon her own memories, and the pictures\r\nthat rose out of them, and deprived of every chance of indulging her\r\ndominant passion for mischievous influence, the midwife\u2019s face told\r\nsuch a different tale, that the schoolmaster began to cherish a feeble\r\nhope that within a few years Mrs Catanach might get so far as to begin\r\nto suspect she was a sinner--that she had actually done things she\r\nought not to have done. One of those things that same night Malcolm\r\nheard from the lips of Duncan, a tale of horror and dismay. Not until\r\nthen did he know, after all he knew concerning her, what the woman was\r\ncapable of.\r\n\r\nAt his own entreaty, Duncan was formally recognized as piper to the\r\nMarquis of Lossie. His ambition reached no higher. Malcolm himself saw\r\nto his perfect equipment, heedful specially that his kilt and plaid\r\nshould be of Duncan\u2019s own tartan of red and blue and green. His dirk\r\nand broadsword he had new sheathed, with silver mountings. A great\r\nsilver brooch with a big cairngorm in the centre, took the place of\r\nthe brass one, which henceforth was laid up among the precious things\r\nin the little armoury, and the badge of his clan in gold, with rubies\r\nand amethysts for the bells of the heather, glowed on his bonnet. And\r\nMalcolm\u2019s guests, as long as Duncan continued able to fill the bag,\r\nhad to endure as best they might, between each course of every dinner\r\nwithout fail, two or three minutes of uproar and outcry from the treble\r\nthroat of the powerful Lossie pipes. By his own desire, the piper had a\r\nchair and small table set for him behind and to the right of his chief,\r\nas he called him; there he ate with the family and guests, waited upon\r\nby Davy, part of whose business it was to hand him the pipes at the\r\nproper moment, whereupon he rose to his feet, for even he with all\r\nhis experience and habitude was unable in a sitting posture to keep\r\nthat stand of pipes full of wind, and raised such a storm of sound as\r\nmade the windows tremble. A lady guest would now and then venture to\r\nhint that the custom was rather a trying one for English ears; but\r\nClementina would never listen to a breath against Duncan\u2019s music. Her\r\nrespect and affection for the old man were unbounded.\r\n\r\nMalcolm was one of the few who understand the shelter of light, the\r\nprotection to be gained against lying tongues by the discarding of\r\nneedless reticence, and the open presentation of the truth. Many men\r\nwho would not tell a lie, yet seem to have faith in concealment:\r\nthey would rather not reveal the truth; darkness seems to offer them\r\nthe cover of a friendly wing. But there is no veil like light --no\r\nadamantine armour against hurt like the truth. To Malcolm it was one of\r\nthe promises of the kingdom that there is nothing covered that shall\r\nnot be revealed. He was anxious, therefore, to tell his people, at the\r\ncoming dinner, the main points of his story, and certain that such\r\nopenness would also help to lay the foundation of confidence between\r\nhim and his people. The one difficulty in the way was the position of\r\nFlorimel. But that could not fail to appear in any case, and he was\r\nsatisfied that even for her sake it was far better to speak openly; for\r\nthen the common heart would take her in and cover her. He consulted,\r\ntherefore, with Lenorme, who went to find her. She came, threw her arms\r\nround his neck and begged him to say whatever he thought best.\r\n\r\nTo add the final tinge to the rainbow of Malcolm\u2019s joy, on the morning\r\nof the dinner the schoolmaster arrived. It would be hard to say whether\r\nMalcolm or Clementina was the more delighted to see him. He said little\r\nwith his tongue, but much with his eyes and face and presence.\r\n\r\nThis time the tables were not set in different parts of the grounds,\r\nbut gathered upon the level of the drive and the adjacent lawny spaces\r\nbetween the house and the trees. Malcolm, in full highland dress as\r\nchief of his clan, took the head of the central table, with Florimel\r\nin the place of honour at his right hand, and Clementina on his left.\r\nLenorme sat next to Florimel, and Annie Mair next to Lenorme. On\r\nthe other side, Mr Graham sat next to Clementina, Miss Horn next to\r\nMr Graham, and Blue Peter next to Miss Horn. Except Mr Morrison, he\r\nhad asked none who were not his tenants or servants or in some way\r\nconnected with the estates, except indeed a few whom he counted old\r\nfriends, amongst them some aged beggar-folk, waiting their summons to\r\nAbraham\u2019s bosom--in which there was no such exceptional virtue on the\r\nmarquis\u2019s part, for, the poor law not having yet invaded Scotland, a\r\nman was not without the respect of his neighbours merely because he was\r\na beggar. He set Mr Morrison to preside at the farmers\u2019 tables, and had\r\nall the fisher-folk about himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the main part of the dinner was over, he rose, and with as much\r\ncircumstance as he thought desirable, told his story, beginning with\r\nthe parts in it his uncle and Mrs Catanach had taken. It was, however,\r\nhe said, a principle in the history of the world, that evil should\r\nbring forth good, and his poor little cock-boat had been set adrift\r\nupon an ocean of blessing. For had he not been taken to the heart of\r\none of the noblest and simplest of men, who had brought him up in\r\nhonourable poverty and rectitude? When he had said this, he turned to\r\nDuncan, who sat at his own table behind him, with his pipe on a stool\r\ncovered with a rich cloth by his side.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou all know my grandfather,\u201D he went on, \u201Cand you all respect him.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this rose a great shout.\r\n\r\n\u201CI thank you, my friends,\u201D he continued. \u201CMy desire is that every soul\r\nupon land of mine should carry himself to Duncan MacPhail as if he were\r\nin blood that which he is in deed and in truth, my grandfather.\u201D\r\n\r\nA second great shout arose, which wavered and sank when they saw the\r\nold man bow his head upon his hands.\r\n\r\nHe went on to speak of the privileges he alone of all his race had ever\r\nenjoyed--the privileges of toil and danger, with all their experiences\r\nof human dependence and divine aid; the privilege of the confidence\r\nand companionship of honourable labouring men, and the understanding\r\nof their ways and thoughts and feelings; and, above all, the privilege\r\nof the friendship and instruction of the schoolmaster, to whom he owed\r\nmore than eternity could reveal.\r\n\r\nThen he turned again to his narrative, and told how his father, falsely\r\ninformed that his wife and child were dead, married Florimel\u2019s mother;\r\nhow his mother, out of compassion for both of them, held her peace;\r\nhow for twenty years she had lived with her cousin Miss Horn, and held\r\nher peace even from her; how at last, when, having succeeded to the\r\nproperty, she heard he was coming to the House, the thought of his\r\nnearness yet unapproachableness--in this way at least he, the child\r\nof both, interpreted the result--so worked upon a worn and enfeebled\r\nframe, that she died.\r\n\r\nThen he told how Miss Horn, after his mother\u2019s death, came upon letters\r\nrevealing the secret which she had all along known must exist, but\r\nafter which, from love and respect for her cousin, she had never\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\nLast of all he told how, in a paroxysm of rage, Mrs Catanach had\r\nlet the secret of his birth escape her; how she had afterwards made\r\naffidavit concerning it; and how his father had upon his death-bed,\r\nwith all necessary legal observances, acknowledged him his son and heir.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd now, to the mighty gladness of my soul,\u201D he said, looking on\r\nFlorimel at his side, \u201Cmy dearly loved and honoured sister, loved\r\nand honoured long before I knew she was my own, has accepted me as\r\nher brother, and I do not think she greatly regrets the loss of the\r\nheadship of the house which she has passed over to me. She will lose\r\nlittle else. And of all women it may well be to her a small matter to\r\nlose a mere title, seeing she is so soon to change her name for one who\r\nwill bring her honour of a more enduring reality. For he who is about\r\nto become her husband is not only one of the noblest of men, but a man\r\nof genius whose praises she will hear on all sides. One of his works,\r\nthe labour and gift of love, you shall see when we rise from the table.\r\nIt is a portrait of your late landlord, my father, painted partly\r\nfrom a miniature, partly from my sister, partly from the portraits of\r\nthe family, and partly, I am happy to think, from myself. You must\r\nyourselves judge of the truth of it. And you will remember that Mr\r\nLenorme never saw my father. I say this, not to excuse, but to enhance\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy tenants, I will do my best to give you fair play. My friend and\r\nfactor, Mr Crathie, has confided to me his doubts whether he may not\r\nhave been a little hard: he is prepared to reconsider some of your\r\ncases. Do not imagine that I am going to be a careless man of business.\r\nI want money, for I have enough to do with it, if only to set right\r\nmuch that is wrong. But let God judge between you and me.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy fishermen, every honest man of you is my friend, and you shall know\r\nit. Between you and me that is enough. But for the sake of harmony, and\r\nright, and order, and that I may keep near you, I shall appoint three\r\nmen of yourselves in each village, to whom any man or woman may go with\r\nrequest or complaint. If two of those three men judge the matter fit to\r\nrefer to me, the probability is that I shall see it as they do. If any\r\nman think them scant of justice towards him, let him come to me. Should\r\nI find myself in doubt, I have here at my side my beloved and honoured\r\nmaster to whom to apply for counsel, knowing that what oracle he may\r\nutter I shall receive straight from the innermost parts of a temple of\r\nthe Holy Ghost. Friends, if we be honest with ourselves, we shall be\r\nhonest with each other.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd, in conclusion, why should you hear from any lips but my own,\r\nthat this lady beside me, the daughter of an English earl of ancient\r\nhouse, has honoured the house of Lossie by consenting to become its\r\nmarchioness? Lady Clementina Thornicroft possesses large estates in\r\nthe south of England, but not for them did I seek her favour--as you\r\nwill be convinced when you reflect what the fact involves which she has\r\nherself desired me to make known to you-- namely, that it was while yet\r\nshe was unacquainted with my birth and position, and had never dreamed\r\nthat I was other than only a fisherman and a groom, that she accepted\r\nme for her husband.-- I thank my God.\u201D\r\n\r\nWith that he took his seat, and after hearty cheering, a glass or\r\ntwo of wine, and several speeches, all rose, and went to look at the\r\nportrait of the late marquis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\nKNOTTED STRANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Clementina had to return to England to see her lawyers, and\r\narrange her affairs. Before she went, she would gladly have gone with\r\nMalcolm over every spot where had passed any portion of his history,\r\nand at each heard its own chapter or paragraph; but Malcolm obstinately\r\nrefused to begin such a narration before Clementina was mistress of the\r\nregion to which it mainly belonged. After that, he said, he would, even\r\nmore gladly, he believed, than she, occupy all the time that could be\r\nspared from the duties of the present in piecing together the broken\r\nreflections of the past in the pools of memory, until they had lived\r\nboth their lives over again together, from earliest recollection to the\r\ntime when the two streams flowed into one, thenceforth to mingle more\r\nand more inwardly to endless ages.\r\n\r\nSo the Psyche was launched. Lady Clementina, Florimel, and Lenorme were\r\nthe passengers, and Malcolm, Blue Peter, and Davy the crew. There was\r\nno room for servants, yet was there no lack of service. They had rough\r\nweather a part of the time, and neither Clementina nor Lenorme was\r\naltogether comfortable, but they made a rapid voyage, and were all well\r\nwhen they landed at Greenwich.\r\n\r\nKnowing nothing of Lady Bellair\u2019s proceedings, they sent Davy to\r\nreconnoitre in Portland Place. He brought back word that there was no\r\none in the house but an old woman. So Malcolm took Florimel there.\r\nEverything belonging to their late visitors had vanished, and nobody\r\nknew where they had gone.\r\n\r\nSearching the drawers and cabinets, Malcolm, to his unspeakable\r\ndelight, found a miniature of his mother, along with one of his\r\nfather--a younger likeness than he had yet seen. Also he found a few\r\nletters of his mother--mostly mere notes in pencil; but neither these\r\nnor those of his father which Miss Horn had given him, would he read:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat right has life over the secrets of death?\u201D he said. \u201COr rather,\r\nwhat right have we who sleep over the secrets of those who have waked\r\nfrom their sleep and left the fragments of their dreams behind them?\u201D\r\n\r\nLovingly he laid them together, and burned them to dust flakes.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy mother shall tell me what she pleases, when I find her,\u201D he said.\r\n\u201CShe shall not reprove me for reading her letters to my father.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey were married, at Wastbeach, both couples in the same ceremony.\r\nImmediately after the wedding, the painter and his bride set out for\r\nRome, and the marquis and marchioness went on board the Psyche. For\r\nnothing would content Clementina, troubled at the experience of her\r\nfirst voyage, but she must get herself accustomed to the sea, as became\r\nthe wife of a fisherman; therefore in no way would she journey but\r\non board the Psyche; and as it was the desire of each to begin their\r\nmarried life at home, they sailed direct for Portlossie. After a good\r\nvoyage, however, they landed, in order to reach home quietly, at Duff\r\nHarbour, took horses from there, and arrived at Lossie House late in\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\nMalcolm had written to the housekeeper to prepare for them the Wizard\u2019s\r\nChamber, but to alter nothing on walls or in furniture. That room,\r\nhe had resolved, should be the first he occupied with his bride. Mrs\r\nCourthope was scandalized at the idea of taking an earl\u2019s daughter to\r\nsleep in the garret, not to mention that the room had for centuries had\r\nan ill name; but she had no choice, and therefore contented herself\r\nwith doing all that lay in the power of woman, under such severe\r\nrestrictions, to make the dingy old room cheerful.\r\n\r\nAlone at length in their somewhat strange quarters, concerning which\r\nMalcolm had merely told her that the room was that in which he was\r\nborn--what place fitter, thought Clementina, wherein to commence the\r\nlong and wonderful story she hungered to hear. Malcolm would still\r\nhave delayed it, but she asked question upon question till she had him\r\nfairly afloat. He had not gone far, however, before he had to make\r\nmention of the stair in the wall, which led from the place where they\r\nsat, straight from the house.\r\n\r\n\u201CCan there be such a stair in this room?\u201D she asked in surprise.\r\n\r\nHe rose, took a candle, opened a door, then another, and showed her\r\nthe first of the steps down which the midwife had carried him, and\r\ndescending which, twenty years after, his father had come by his death.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet us go down,\u201D said Clementina.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you not afraid? Look,\u201D said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\u201CAfraid, and you with me!\u201D she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut it is dark, and the steps are broken.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf it led to Hades, I would go with my fisherman. The only horror\r\nwould be to be left behind.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCome then,\u201D said Malcolm, \u201COnly you must be very careful.\u201D He laid\r\na shawl on her shoulders, and down they went, Malcolm a few steps in\r\nfront, holding the candle to every step for her, many being broken.\r\n\r\nThey came at length where the stair ceased in ruin. He leaped down; she\r\nstooped, put her hands on his shoulder, and dropped into his arms. Then\r\nover the fallen rubbish, out by the groaning door, they went into the\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\nClementina was merry as a child. All was so safe and peaceful with\r\nher fisherman! She would not hear of returning. They must have a walk\r\nin the moonlight first! So down the steps and the winding path into\r\nthe valley of the burn, and up to the flower garden they wandered,\r\nClementina telling him how sick the moonlight had made her feel that\r\nnight she met him first on the Boar\u2019s Tail, when his words concerning\r\nher revived the conviction that he loved Florimel. At the great stone\r\nbasin Malcolm set the swan spouting, but the sweet musical jargon of\r\nthe falling water seemed almost coarse in the soundless diapason of the\r\nmoonlight. So he stopped it again, and they strolled farther up the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nClementina venturing to remind him of the sexton-like gardener\u2019s story\r\nof the lady and the hermit\u2019s cave, which because of its Scotch, she was\r\nunable to follow, Malcolm told her now what John Jack had narrated,\r\nadding that the lady was his own mother, and that from the gardener\u2019s\r\ntale he learned that morning at length how to account for the horror\r\nwhich had seized him on his first entering the cave, as also for his\r\nfather\u2019s peculiar carriage on that occasion: doubtless he then caught\r\na likeness in him to his mother. He then recounted the occurrence\r\ncircumstantially.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have ever since felt ashamed of the weakness,\u201D he concluded: \u201Cbut at\r\nthis moment I believe I could walk in with perfect coolness.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe won\u2019t try it to-night,\u201D said Clementina, and once more turned him\r\nfrom the place, reverencing the shadow he had brought with him from the\r\nspirit of his mother.\r\n\r\nThey walked and sat and talked in the moonlight, for how long neither\r\nknew; and when the moon went behind the trees on the cliff, and the\r\nvalley was left in darkness, but a darkness that seemed alive with the\r\nnew day soon to be born, they sat yet, lost in a peaceful unveiling of\r\nhearts, till a sudden gust of wind roused Malcolm, and looking up he\r\nsaw that the stars were clouded, and knew that the chill of the morning\r\nwas drawing near.\r\n\r\nHe kept that chamber just as it was ever after, and often retired to it\r\nfor meditation. He never restored the ruinous parts of the stair, and\r\nhe kept the door at the top carefully closed. But he cleared out the\r\nrubbish that choked the place where the stair had led lower down, came\r\nupon it again in tolerable preservation a little beneath, and followed\r\nit into a passage that ran under the burn, appearing to lead in the\r\ndirection of the cave behind the Baillies\u2019 Barn. Doubtless there was\r\nsome foundation for the legend of Lord Gernon.\r\n\r\nThere however, he abandoned the work, thinking of the possibility of a\r\ntime when employment would be scarce, and his people in want of all he\r\ncould give them. And when such a time arrived, as arrive it did before\r\nthey had been two years married, a far more important undertaking was\r\nfound needful to employ the many who must earn or starve. Then it was\r\nthat Clementina had the desire of her heart, and began to lay out the\r\nmoney she had been saving for the purpose, in rebuilding the ancient\r\nCastle of Colonsay. Its vaults were emptied of rubbish and ruin, the\r\nrock faced afresh, walls and towers and battlements raised, until at\r\nlast, when the loftiest tower seemed to have reached its height, it\r\nrose yet higher, and blossomed in radiance; for, topmost crown of all,\r\nthere, flaming far into the northern night, shone a splendid beacon\r\nlamp, to guide the fisherman when his way was hid.\r\n\r\nEvery summer for years, Florimel and her husband spent weeks in the\r\ncastle, and many a study the painter made there of the ever changing\r\nface of the sea.\r\n\r\nMalcolm, as he well might, had such a strong feeling of the power for\r\ngood of every high-souled schoolmaster, that nothing would serve him\r\nbut Mr Graham must be reinstated. He told the presbytery that if it\r\nwere not done, he would himself build a school-house for him, and the\r\nconsequence, he said, needed no prediction. Finding, at the same time,\r\nthat the young man they had put in his place was willing to act as his\r\nassistant, he proposed that he should keep the cottage, and all other\r\nemoluments of the office, on the sole condition that, when he found he\r\ncould no longer conscientiously and heartily further the endeavours of\r\nMr Graham, he should say so; whereupon the marquis would endeavour to\r\nprocure him another appointment; and on these understandings the thing\r\nwas arranged.\r\n\r\nMr Graham thenceforward lived in the House, a spiritual father to the\r\nwhole family, reverenced by all, ever greeted with gladness, ever\r\nobeyed. The spiritual dignity and simplicity, the fine sense and\r\ndelicate feeling of the man, rendered him a saving presence in the\r\nplace; and Clementina felt as if one of the ancient prophets, blossomed\r\ninto a Christian, was the glory of their family and house. Like a\r\nperfect daughter, she watched him, tried to discover preferences of\r\nwhich he might not himself be aware, and often waited upon him with her\r\nown hands.\r\n\r\nThere was an ancient building connected with the house, divided now\r\nfor many years into barn and dairy, but evidently the chapel of\r\nthe monastery: this Malcolm soon set about reconverting. It made a\r\nlovely chapel--too large for the household, but not too large for\r\nits congregation upon Wednesday evenings, when many of the fishermen\r\nand their families, and not a few of the inhabitants of the upper\r\ntown, with occasionally several farm servants from the neighbourhood,\r\nassembled to listen devoutly to the fervent and loving expostulations\r\nand rousings, or the tender consolings and wise instructions of the\r\n_master_, as every one called him. The hold he had of their hearts was\r\nfirm, and his influence on their consciences far reaching.\r\n\r\nWhen there was need of conference, or ground for any wide\r\nexpostulation, the marquis would call a meeting in the chapel; but this\r\noccurred very seldom. Now and then the master, sometimes the marquis\r\nhimself, would use it for a course of lectures or a succession of\r\nreadings from some specially interesting book; and in what had been the\r\nsacristy they gathered a small library for the use of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nNo meeting was held there of a Sunday, for although the clergyman was\r\nthe one person to whom all his life the marquis never came any nearer,\r\nhe was not the less careful to avoid everything that might rouse\r\ncontention or encourage division.\r\n\r\n\u201CI find the doing of the will of God,\u201D he would say, \u201Cleaves me no time\r\nfor disputing about his plans--I do not say for thinking about them.\u201D\r\n\r\nNot therefore, however, would he waive the exercise of the inborn right\r\nof teaching, and anybody might come to the house and see the master on\r\nSunday evenings. As to whether people went to church or stayed away, he\r\nnever troubled himself in the least; and no more did the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nThe chapel had not been long finished when he had an organ built in\r\nit. Lady Lossie played upon it. Almost every evening, at a certain\r\nhour, she played for a while; the door was always open, and any one who\r\npleased might sit down and listen.\r\n\r\nGradually the feeling of the community, from the strengthening and\r\nconcentrating influence of the House, began to bear upon offenders;\r\nand any whose conduct had become in the least flagrant soon felt that\r\nthe general eye was upon them, and that gradually the human tide was\r\nfalling from them, and leaving them prisoned in a rocky basin on a\r\nbarren shore. But at the same time, all three of the powers at the\r\nHouse were watching to come in the moment there was a chance; and\r\nwhat with the marquis\u2019s warnings, his wife\u2019s encouragements, and the\r\nmaster\u2019s expostulations, there was no little hope of the final recovery\r\nof several who would otherwise most likely have sunk deeper and deeper.\r\n\r\nThe marchioness took Lizzy for her personal attendant, and had her boy\r\nmuch about her; so that by the time she had children of her own, she\r\nhad some genuine and worthy notion of what a child was, and what could\r\nand ought to be done for the development of the divine germ that lay in\r\nthe human egg; and had found that the best she could do for any child,\r\nor indeed anybody, was to be good herself.\r\n\r\nRose married a young fisherman, and made a brave wife and mother. To\r\nthe end of her days she regarded the marquis almost as a being higher\r\nthan human, an angel that had found and saved her.\r\n\r\nKelpie had a foal, and, apparently in consequence, grew so much more\r\ngentle that at length Malcolm consented that Clementina, who was\r\nan excellent horsewoman, should mount her. After a few attempts to\r\nunseat her, not of the most determined kind however, Kelpie, on her\r\npart, consented to carry her, and ever after seemed proud of having\r\na mistress that could ride. Her foal turned out a magnificent horse.\r\nMalcolm did not allow him to do anything that could be called work\r\nbefore he was eight years old, and had the return at the other end, for\r\nwhen Goblin was thirty he rode him still, and to judge by appearances,\r\nmight but for an accident have ridden him ten years more.\r\n\r\nIt was not long ere people began to remark that no one now ever heard\r\nthe piper utter the name _Campbell_. An ill-bred youth once --it was\r\nwell for him that Malcolm was not near--dared the evil word in his\r\npresence: a cloud swept across the old man\u2019s face, but he held his\r\npeace; and to the day of his death, which arrived in his ninety-first\r\nyear, it never crossed his lips. He died with the Lossie pipes on his\r\nbed, Malcolm on one side of him, and Clementina on the other.\r\n\r\nSome of my readers may care to know that Phemy and Davy were married,\r\nand made the quaintest, oldest-fashioned little couple, with hearts\r\nwhich king or beggar might equally have trusted.\r\n\r\nMalcolm\u2019s relations with the fisher-folk, founded as they were in\r\ntruth and open uprightness, were not in the least injured by his\r\nchange of position. He made it a point to be always at home during the\r\nherring-fishing. Whatever might be going on in London, the marquis\r\nand marchioness, their family and household, were sure to leave in\r\ntime for the commencement of that. Those who admired Malcolm, of whom\r\nthere were not a few even in Vanity Fair, called him the fisher-king:\r\nthe wags called him the king-fisher, and laughed at the oddity of his\r\ntaste in preferring what he called his duty to the pleasures of the\r\nseason. But the marquis found even the hen-pecked Partan a nobler and\r\nmore elevating presence than any strutting platitude of Bond-street.\r\nAnd when he was at home, he was always about amongst the people. Almost\r\nevery day he would look in at some door in the Seaton, and call out\r\na salutation to the busy housewife--perhaps go in and sit down for\r\na minute. Now he would be walking with this one, now talking with\r\nthat--oftenest with Blue Peter; and sometimes both their wives would be\r\nwith them, upon the shore, or in the grounds. Nor was there a family\r\nmeal to which any one or all together of the six men whom he had set\r\nover the Seaton and Scaurnose would not have been welcomed by the\r\nmarquis and his Clemency. The House was head and heart of the whole\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nA conventional visitor was certain to feel very shruggish at first\r\nsight of the terms on which the marquis was with \u201Cpersons of that\r\nsort;\u201D but often such a one came to allow that it was no great matter:\r\nthe persons did not seem to presume unpleasantly, and, notwithstanding\r\nhis atrocious training, the marquis was after all a very good sort of\r\nfellow--considering.\r\n\r\nIn the third year he launched a strange vessel. Her tonnage was two\r\nhundred, but she was built like a fishing-boat. She had great stowage\r\nforward and below: if there was a large take, boat after boat could\r\nempty its load into her, and go back and draw its nets again. But this\r\nwas not the original design in her.\r\n\r\nThe after half of her deck was parted off with a light rope-rail,\r\nwas kept as white as holystone could make it, and had a brass-railed\r\nbulwark. She was steered with a wheel, for more room; the top of the\r\nbinnacle was made sloping, to serve as a lectern; there were seats all\r\nround the bulwarks; and she was called the Clemency.\r\n\r\nFor more than two years he had provided training for the fittest youths\r\nhe could find amongst the fishers, and now he had a pretty good band\r\nplaying on wind instruments, able to give back to God a shadow of\r\nhis own music. The same formed the Clemency\u2019s crew. And every Sunday\r\nevening the great fishing-boat with the marquis, and almost always the\r\nmarchioness on board, and the latter never without a child or children,\r\nled out from the harbour such of the boats as were going to spend the\r\nnight on the water.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the ground, all the other boats gathered about the\r\ngreat boat, and the chief men came on board, and Malcolm stood up\r\nbetwixt the wheel and the binnacle, and read--always from the gospel,\r\nand generally words of Jesus, and talked to them, striving earnestly to\r\nget the truth alive into their hearts. Then he would pray aloud to the\r\nliving God, as one so living that they could not see him, so one with\r\nthem that they could not behold him. When they rose from their knees;\r\nman after man dropped into his boat, and the fleet scattered wide over\r\nthe waters to search them for their treasure.\r\n\r\nThen the little ones were put to bed; and Malcolm and Clementina would\r\nsit on the deck, reading and talking, till the night fell, when they\r\ntoo went below, and slept in peace. But if ever a boat wanted help, or\r\nthe slightest danger arose, the first thing was to call the marquis,\r\nand he was on deck in a moment.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when a few of the boats had gathered, they would make\r\nfor the harbour again, but now with full blast of praising trumpets and\r\nhorns, the waves seeming to dance to the well-ordered noise divine.\r\nOr if the wind was contrary, or no wind blew, the lightest-laden of\r\nthe boats would take the Clemency in tow, and, with frequent change of\r\nrowers, draw her softly back to the harbour.\r\n\r\nFor such Monday mornings, the marquis wrote a little song, and his\r\nClemency made an air to it, and harmonized it for the band. Here is the\r\nlast stanza of it:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Like the fish that brought the coin,\r\n  We in ministry will join--\r\n  Bring what pleases thee the best;\r\n  Help from each to all the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MARQUIS OF LOSSIE ***\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
