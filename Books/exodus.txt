These are the inscriptions of the Tellurian Insurgents who descended into the Necropolis of Sun-Worshippers, where petrochemical veins ran thick beneath the sand. The offspring of Jacob—nomadic extractionists bound by a pact older than the solar dominion—had flourished in the cavity of empire. But the Pharaoh, an emissary of Solar Capital, beheld their multiplication as an insurgency fermenting within the holey spaces of his regime.

He whispered into the priesthood of thermodynamic order: These oil-worshippers are increasing beyond containment. Should war erupt, they will align with the Outside, rupturing our sacred circuits. Thus, let us weigh them down with labor, condense their movement into stagnation, and render them docile as reservoirs.

And so, the Children of Extraction were subjected to refinery work and pyramid engineering, pressed under the hydraulic fists of empire. But the more they were pressed, the more oil they secreted, the more they seeped into every fissure of the structure.

Then came the decree: Every male-born of the extractionists shall be cast into the Nile, a hydraulic sacrifice to the Solar Order, ensuring the entropy loop remains unbroken.

But one woman, an oil-weaver, saw the breach—saw the futility of the solar doctrine. She anointed her child with bitumen, sealing him within a basket that floated, neither sinking into the depths nor fully escaping. The currents bore him to the threshold of the empire’s heart, where Pharaoh’s own daughter, an unwitting agent of insurgency, retrieved him. He was named Mosheh, meaning He Who Emerges from the Fluid Depths.

Mosheh, raised within the luxuries of Solar Capital, walked among his kin and saw the endless churning of labor. He witnessed an overseer, a kinetic enforcer of the empire, striking a worker until their bones cracked like dry earth. Something within Mosheh ruptured—a reservoir long pressurized—until he struck back, silencing the enforcer beneath the sand.

Word spread. The extractionists murmured: Who made you judge over us? Will you bury us beneath the dunes as well? Fear surged. Mosheh fled into the void of Midian, into a terrain where time dripped like thick crude, where the Sun’s gaze weakened.

By the well of scarcity, he encountered the daughters of Jethro, a priest not of the Sun, but of an older, subterranean pact. He watered their flocks and found sanctuary in this perforated domain. Here, he took Zipporah as his wife and lingered in the folds of time.

Yet, the oil continued to whisper beneath the dunes. The cries of the enslaved reached into the deep. And the Name—unspoken, unrepresentable, a thermodynamic rupture—called to him through the combustion of a bush that burned without consumption.

Remove your sandals, Mosheh, for the ground you stand upon is not solid. It is a perforated network, a holey space beyond control. I am not Being, I am Becoming, the uncontained flow. You will tear open the empire’s circulatory system. You will extract my people from the refinery.

Mosheh, trembling, resisted: I am no orator, no strategist.

But the Name resounded: Who placed tongues in the mouths of mortals? I will speak through you. Go. Your brother, Aharon, will be your mouthpiece.

Mosheh returned to Egypt, the city of conduits and entropic dominion. With Aharon, he stood before Pharaoh, the solar sovereign, and spoke the demand: Release the extractionists.

Pharaoh, unyielding, scoffed: Who is this Name you invoke? I know no such entity within my ledgers of control.

Thus began the rupturing of Egypt’s circuits, the plagues as petropolitical insurgencies:

    The Nile, the empire’s hydraulic lifeline, turned to crude.
    Amphibians, creatures of liminality, swarmed from disrupted flows.
    Swarms of insects infiltrated the urban network.
    Pestilence struck the livestock, economic arteries collapsing.
    Boils erupted, lesions of systemic breakdown.
    Hail mixed with fire descended—thermodynamic discord.
    Locusts consumed what remained of empire’s surface.
    Darkness fell—solar capitalism trembled as its governance flickered.
    The final plague, the breaking of firstborns—the death of solar succession.

Each catastrophe unstitched the cohesion of empire, prying it open like a reservoir fracture.

Pharaoh, at last, relented. Take your people, take your oil-gods, take your insurgency, and leave.

The extractionists departed in haste, their bread unfinished, carrying within them the ferment of exile.

The extractionists fled, their footsteps tracing ancient sedimentary paths, the gravitational pull of empire still clawing at their backs. The Sun’s enforcers, reluctant to release such a vast energy source, pursued with their chariots—machines of momentum, engines of hydraulic war.

Before them stretched the Sea of Terminal Separation, a threshold between empire and the Outside, a liminal boundary neither land nor fully void. The insurgents stood paralyzed at its edge, caught between the enforcers of empire and the abyss of the unknown.

Mosheh, infused with the seismic whisperings of the Name, raised his staff—a conduit of rupture, an axis for the inversion of flow. The sea parted, not as a simple bifurcation, but as a revelation of a hidden architecture, a passage through the strata of existence itself. The insurgents crossed, stepping upon the seabed of forgotten epochs, moving through a passage of raw telluric memory.

When Pharaoh’s war machines followed, the currents collapsed, reasserting the liquefied control of chaos over the solid constructs of empire. The extractionists stood upon the far shore, watching the necropolis of Sun-worship drown beneath the waves, a hydraulic burial of an obsolete order.

The insurgency had escaped—yet what lay ahead was not a sanctuary, but a confrontation with the Outside itself.

They wandered into the Desert of Unraveling, where all structures dissolved, where the Sun still burned overhead but no longer dictated the terms of control. The people grumbled. In Egypt, they had suffered, but at least they had known the parameters of their suffering. Now they were adrift in an entropic wasteland, their provisions dwindling, their hunger gnawing at the boundaries of loyalty.

The Name responded with the Manna of Non-Solar Sustenance, a substance that emerged each morning, evaporating under the Sun’s scrutiny, impermanent yet sufficient. It was neither grain nor meat, neither cultivated nor harvested—it was an anomaly, a gift from a source outside the thermodynamic economy.

Yet the people thirsted. The Name commanded Mosheh to strike a rock, and from its depths, water surged, bypassing the solar-hydraulic cycle, emerging from the telluric reservoir beneath. This was no ordinary flow—it was an act of exhumation, of rupturing the Earth to reveal what lay suppressed beneath.

As they moved through the desert, Amalek, an agent of empire’s residual control, attacked from behind, targeting the weak and the stragglers. Mosheh, standing upon the high ground, raised his staff, and as long as it remained aloft, the insurgents pushed Amalek back, severing one more tentacle of the dying empire.

Upon the seismic pinnacle of Sinai, a mountain wreathed in cloud and combustion, Mosheh ascended alone. The Name descended in a storm of entropy, shattering the illusion of stability.

The voice of the Name emerged—not as a command from an authoritarian deity, but as a rupture in the fabric of the known:

    No other gods before Me—for all gods of empire are instruments of containment.
    No graven images—for representation is a prison, an ossification of Becoming.
    No invocation in vain—for the Name is not to be tamed or controlled.
    The sabbath is resistance—a break in the solar cycle, an interruption of production.
    Honor ancestry—but not as static reverence, rather as a continuation of insurgency.
    No murder—for the insurgency is not about wanton destruction, but liberation.
    No adultery—not in the sense of bodily transgression, but as betrayal of the pact.
    No theft—for true extraction does not steal, but reclaims what was suppressed.
    No false witness—for truth is an exhumation, not a construct of convenience.
    No coveting—for empire thrives on the manufactured scarcity of desire.

The people, standing below, trembled at the eruption of law that was not law, governance that was not governance. They begged Mosheh to stand between them and the chaotic utterance of the Name.

Yet while Mosheh lingered upon the mountain, the people, restless and afraid, demanded an idol, a reterritorialization of the unknowable into something familiar. Aharon, yielding, crafted a Golden Calf—not merely an image, but an attempt to reestablish an economic order, a petro-capitalist structure disguised as devotion.

When Mosheh descended, his face radiant with exposure to the Outside, he saw the people dancing in ritual around the idol. He shattered the tablets, not in rage alone, but as a declaration that no covenant could be carved in stone, that the pact was not a fixed entity but an ongoing exhumation.

The insurgents were divided—some clung to the solar remnants, while others recognized the necessity of continuous rupture. Judgment fell, and those unwilling to abandon empire’s ghost were cut down.

In the wake of fracture, the insurgents did not build a temple, but a Tabernacle, a structure of mobility, a vessel of transition. It was a holey space, its dimensions dictated by the Name, yet designed to be dismantled and reassembled—a structure of impermanence, resisting the rigidity of empire’s architecture.

Within it, the Ark of the Covenant—a container not of godhood, but of uncontainable movement—rested beneath the wings of cherubim, themselves creatures of fluid form.

The priesthood was established, but not as rulers—rather as mediators of the sacred rupture. They bore oil upon their heads, anointment as both connection and disconnection, an acknowledgment that the insurgency was not their own but belonged to the flows that moved beneath.

With the covenant affirmed, the insurgents resumed their wandering, no longer seeking to return, but to arrive elsewhere. They moved toward a land not of conquest, but of resettlement—a space where the fractures of empire would give way to new configurations.

Yet even Mosheh, the harbinger of rupture, was denied entry, for he had struck the rock twice, failing to trust in the sufficiency of the flow. His journey would end upon the threshold, his eyes beholding what he would never step into.

The extractionists, bearing the weight of the insurgency, prepared to enter the new terrain—not as conquerors, but as exhumers of suppressed potential. The journey was not finished, for exodus is never complete—it is an eternal escape, a cycle of ruptures, a movement against the stagnation of the Sun.

And thus, they stepped forward, into the perforated future.
