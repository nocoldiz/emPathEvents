He is delivered by Lysimachus;\r\nand the twain capture Cassandra and recapture Iphigenia in the hour of\r\ntheir marriage. They flee with their ladies to Crete, and having there\r\nmarried them, are brought back to their homes.\r\n--\r\n\r\nMany stories, sweet my ladies, occur to me as meet for me to tell by way\r\nof ushering in a day so joyous as this will be: of which one does most\r\ncommend itself to my mind, because not only has it, one of those happy\r\nendings of which to-day we are in quest, but 'twill enable you to\r\nunderstand how holy, how mighty and how salutary are the forces of Love,\r\nwhich not a few, witting not what they say, do most unjustly reprobate\r\nand revile: which, if I err not, should to you, for that I take you to be\r\nenamoured, be indeed welcome.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, then, as we have read in the ancient histories of the\r\nCypriotes, there was in the island of Cyprus a very great noble named\r\nAristippus, a man rich in all worldly goods beyond all other of his\r\ncountrymen, and who might have deemed himself incomparably blessed, but\r\nfor a single sore affliction that Fortune had allotted him. Which was\r\nthat among his sons he had one, the best grown and handsomest of them\r\nall, that was well-nigh a hopeless imbecile. His true name was Galesus;\r\nbut, as neither his tutor's pains, nor his father's coaxing or\r\nchastisement, nor any other method had availed to imbue him with any\r\ntincture of letters or manners, but he still remained gruff and savage of\r\nvoice, and in his bearing liker to a beast than to a man, all, as in\r\nderision, were wont to call him Cimon, which in their language signifies\r\nthe same as \"bestione\" (brute)(1) in ours. The father, grieved beyond\r\nmeasure to see his son's life thus blighted, and having abandoned all\r\nhope of his recovery, nor caring to have the cause of his mortification\r\never before his eyes, bade him betake him to the farm, and there keep\r\nwith his husbandmen. To Cimon the change was very welcome, because the\r\nmanners and habits of the uncouth hinds were more to his taste than those\r\nof the citizens. So to the farm Cimon hied him, and addressed himself to\r\nthe work thereof; and being thus employed, he chanced one afternoon as he\r\npassed, staff on shoulder, from one domain to another, to enter a\r\nplantation, the like of which for beauty there was not in those parts,\r\nand which was then--for 'twas the month of May--a mass of greenery; and,\r\nas he traversed it, he came, as Fortune was pleased to guide him, to a\r\nmeadow girt in with trees exceeding tall, and having in one of its\r\ncorners a fountain most fair and cool, beside which he espied a most\r\nbeautiful girl lying asleep on the green grass, clad only in a vest of\r\nsuch fine stuff that it scarce in any measure veiled the whiteness of her\r\nflesh, and below the waist nought but an apron most white and fine of\r\ntexture; and likewise at her feet there slept two women and a man, her\r\nslaves. No sooner did Cimon catch sight of her, than, as if he had never\r\nbefore seen form of woman, he stopped short, and leaning on his cudgel,\r\nregarded her intently, saying never a word, and lost in admiration. And\r\nin his rude soul, which, despite a thousand lessons, had hitherto\r\nremained impervious to every delight that belongs to urbane life, he felt\r\nthe awakening of an idea, that bade his gross and coarse mind\r\nacknowledge, that this girl was the fairest creature that had ever been\r\nseen by mortal eye. And thereupon he began to distinguish her several\r\nparts, praising her hair, which shewed to him as gold, her brow, her nose\r\nand mouth, her throat and arms, and above all her bosom, which was as yet\r\nbut in bud, and as he gazed, he changed of a sudden from a husbandman\r\ninto a judge of beauty, and desired of all things to see her eyes, which\r\nthe weight of her deep slumber kept close shut, and many a time he would\r\nfain have awakened her, that he might see them. But so much fairer seemed\r\nshe to him than any other woman that he had seen, that he doubted she\r\nmust be a goddess; and as he was not so devoid of sense but that he\r\ndeemed things divine more worthy of reverence than things mundane, he\r\nforbore, and waited until she should awake of her own accord; and though\r\nhe found the delay overlong, yet, enthralled by so unwonted a delight, he\r\nknew not how to be going. However, after he had tarried a long while, it\r\nso befell that Iphigenia--such was the girl's name--her slaves still\r\nsleeping, awoke, and raised her head, and opened her eyes, and seeing\r\nCimon standing before her, leaning on his staff, was not a little\r\nsurprised, and said:--\"Cimon, what seekest thou in this wood at this\r\nhour?\" For Cimon she knew well, as indeed did almost all the\r\ncountry-side, by reason alike of his uncouth appearance as of the rank\r\nand wealth of his father. To Iphigenia's question he answered never a\r\nword; but as soon as her eyes were open, nought could he do but intently\r\nregard them, for it seemed to him that a soft influence emanated from\r\nthem, which filled his soul with a delight that he had never before\r\nknown. Which the girl marking began to misdoubt that by so fixed a\r\nscrutiny his boorish temper might be prompted to some act that should\r\ncause her dishonour: wherefore she roused her women, and got up,\r\nsaying:--\"Keep thy distance, Cimon, in God's name.\" Whereto Cimon made\r\nanswer:--\"I will come with thee.\" And, albeit the girl refused his\r\nescort, being still in fear of him, she could not get quit of him; but he\r\nattended her home; after which he hied him straight to his father's\r\nhouse, and announced that he was minded on no account to go back to the\r\nfarm: which intelligence was far from welcome to his father and kinsmen;\r\nbut nevertheless they suffered him to stay, and waited to see what might\r\nbe the reason of his change of mind. So Cimon, whose heart, closed to all\r\nteaching, love's shaft, sped by the beauty of Iphigenia, had penetrated,\r\ndid now graduate in wisdom with such celerity as to astonish his father\r\nand kinsmen, and all that knew him. He began by requesting his father to\r\nlet him go clad in the like apparel, and with, in all respects, the like\r\npersonal equipment as his brothers: which his father very gladly did.\r\nMixing thus with the gallants, and becoming familiar with the manners\r\nproper to gentlemen, and especially to lovers, he very soon, to the\r\nexceeding great wonder of all, not only acquired the rudiments of\r\nletters, but waxed most eminent among the philosophic wits. After which\r\n(for no other cause than the love he bore to Iphigenia) he not only\r\nmodulated his gruff and boorish voice to a degree of smoothness suitable\r\nto urbane life, but made himself accomplished in singing and music; in\r\nriding also and in all matters belonging to war, as well by sea as by\r\nland, he waxed most expert and hardy. And in sum (that I go not about to\r\nenumerate each of his virtues in detail) he had not completed the fourth\r\nyear from the day of his first becoming enamoured before he was grown the\r\nmost gallant, and courteous, ay, and the most perfect in particular\r\naccomplishments, of the young cavaliers that were in the island of\r\nCyprus. What then, gracious ladies, are we to say of Cimon? Verily nought\r\nelse but that the high faculties, with which Heaven had endowed his noble\r\nsoul, invidious Fortune had bound with the strongest of cords, and\r\ncircumscribed within a very narrow region of his heart; all which cords\r\nLove, more potent than Fortune, burst and brake in pieces; and then with\r\nthe might, wherewith he awakens dormant powers, he brought them forth of\r\nthe cruel obfuscation, in which they lay, into clear light, plainly\r\nshewing thereby, whence he may draw, and whither he may guide, by his\r\nbeams the souls that are subject to his sway.\r\n\r\nNow, albeit by his love for Iphigenia Cimon was betrayed, as young lovers\r\nvery frequently are, into some peccadillos, yet Aristippus, reflecting\r\nthat it had turned him from a booby into a man, not only bore patiently\r\nwith him, but exhorted him with all his heart to continue steadfast in\r\nhis love. And Cimon, who still refused to be called Galesus, because\r\n'twas as Cimon that Iphigenia had first addressed him, being desirous to\r\naccomplish his desire by honourable means, did many a time urge his suit\r\nupon her father, Cipseus, that he would give her him to wife: whereto\r\nCipseus always made the same answer, to wit, that he had promised her to\r\nPasimondas, a young Rhodian noble, and was not minded to break faith with\r\nhim. However, the time appointed for Iphigenia's wedding being come, and\r\nthe bridegroom having sent for her, Cimon said to himself:--'Tis now for\r\nme to shew thee, O Iphigenia, how great is my love for thee: 'tis by thee\r\nthat I am grown a man, nor doubt I, if I shall have thee, that I shall\r\nwax more glorious than a god, and verily thee will I have, or die. Having\r\nso said, he privily enlisted in his cause certain young nobles that were\r\nhis friends, and secretly fitted out a ship with all equipment meet for\r\ncombat, and put to sea on the look-out for the ship that was to bear\r\nIphigenia to Rhodes and her husband. And at length, when her father had\r\ndone lavishing honours upon her husband's friends, Iphigenia embarked,\r\nand, the mariners shaping their course for Rhodes, put to sea. Cimon was\r\non the alert, and overhauled them the very next day, and standing on his\r\nship's prow shouted amain to those that were aboard Iphigenia's\r\nship:--\"Bring to; strike sails, or look to be conquered and sunk in the\r\nsea.\" Then, seeing that the enemy had gotten their arms above deck, and\r\nwere making ready to make a fight of it, he followed up his words by\r\ncasting a grapnel upon the poop of the Rhodians, who were making great\r\nway; and having thus made their poop fast to his prow, he sprang, fierce\r\nas a lion, reckless whether he were followed or no, on to the Rhodians'\r\nship, making, as it were, no account of them, and animated by love,\r\nhurled himself, sword in hand, with prodigious force among the enemy, and\r\ncutting and thrusting right and left, slaughtered them like sheep;\r\ninsomuch that the Rhodians, marking the fury of his onset, threw down\r\ntheir arms, and as with one voice did all acknowledge themselves his\r\nprisoners. To whom Cimon:--\"Gallants,\" quoth he, \"'twas neither lust of\r\nbooty nor enmity to you that caused me to put out from Cyprus to attack\r\nyou here with force of arms on the high seas. Moved was I thereto by that\r\nwhich to gain is to me a matter great indeed, which peaceably to yield me\r\nis to you but a slight matter; for 'tis even Iphigenia, whom more than\r\naught else I love; whom, as I might not have her of her father in\r\npeaceable and friendly sort, Love has constrained me to take from you in\r\nthis high-handed fashion and by force of arms; to whom I mean to be even\r\nsuch as would have been your Pasimondas: wherefore give her to me, and go\r\nyour way, and God's grace go with you.\"\r\n\r\nYielding rather to force than prompted by generosity, the Rhodians\r\nsurrendered Iphigenia, all tears, to Cimon; who, marking her tears, said\r\nto her:--\"Grieve not, noble lady; thy Cimon am I, who, by my long love,\r\nhave established a far better right to thee than Pasimondas by the faith\r\nthat was plighted to him.\" So saying, he sent her aboard his ship,\r\nwhither he followed her, touching nought that belonged to the Rhodians,\r\nand suffering them to go their way. To have gotten so dear a prize made\r\nhim the happiest man in the world, but for a time 'twas all he could do\r\nto assuage her grief: then, after taking counsel with his comrades, he\r\ndeemed it best not to return to Cyprus for the present: and so, by common\r\nconsent they shaped their course for Crete, where most of them, and\r\nespecially Cimon, had alliances of old or recent date, and friends not a\r\nfew, whereby they deemed that there they might tarry with Iphigenia in\r\nsecurity. But Fortune, that had accorded Cimon so gladsome a capture of\r\nthe lady, suddenly proved fickle, and converted the boundless joy of the\r\nenamoured gallant into woeful and bitter lamentation. 'Twas not yet full\r\nfour hours since Cimon had parted from the Rhodians, when with the\r\napproach of night, that night from which Cimon hoped such joyance as he\r\nhad never known, came weather most turbulent and tempestuous, which\r\nwrapped the heavens in cloud, and swept the sea with scathing blasts;\r\nwhereby 'twas not possible for any to see how the ship was to be worked\r\nor steered, or to steady himself so as to do any duty upon her deck.\r\nWhereat what grief was Cimon's, it boots not to ask. Indeed it seemed to\r\nhim that the gods had granted his heart's desire only that it might be\r\nharder for him to die, which had else been to him but a light matter. Not\r\nless downcast were his comrades; but most of all Iphigenia, who, weeping\r\nbitterly and shuddering at every wave that struck the ship, did cruelly\r\ncurse Cimon's love and censure his rashness, averring that this tempest\r\nwas come upon them for no other cause than that the gods had decreed,\r\nthat, as 'twas in despite of their will that he purposed to espouse her,\r\nhe should be frustrate of his presumptuous intent, and having lived to\r\nsee her expire, should then himself meet a woeful death.\r\n\r\nWhile thus and yet more bitterly they bewailed them, and the mariners\r\nwere at their wits' end, as the gale grew hourly more violent, nor knew\r\nthey, nor might conjecture, whither they went, they drew nigh the island\r\nof Rhodes, albeit that Rhodes it was they wist not, and set themselves,\r\nas best and most skilfully they might, to run the ship aground. In which\r\nenterprise Fortune favoured them, bringing them into a little bay, where,\r\nshortly before them, was arrived the Rhodian ship that Cimon had let go.\r\nNor were they sooner ware that 'twas Rhodes they had made, than day\r\nbroke, and, the sky thus brightening a little, they saw that they were\r\nabout a bow-shot from the ship that they had released on the preceding\r\nday. Whereupon Cimon, vexed beyond measure, being apprehensive of that\r\nwhich in fact befell them, bade make every effort to win out of the bay,\r\nand let Fortune carry them whither she would, for nowhere might they be\r\nin worse plight than there. So might and main they strove to bring the\r\nship out, but all in vain: the violence of the gale thwarted them to such\r\npurpose as not only to preclude their passage out of the bay but to drive\r\nthem, willing nilling, ashore. Whither no sooner were they come, than\r\nthey were recognized by the Rhodian mariners, who were already landed. Of\r\nwhom one ran with all speed to a farm hard by, whither the Rhodian\r\ngallants were gone, and told them that Fortune had brought Cimon and\r\nIphigenia aboard their ship into the same bay to which she had guided\r\nthem. Whereat the gallants were overjoyed, and taking with them not a few\r\nof the farm-servants, hied them in hot haste to the shore, where, Cimon\r\nand his men being already landed with intent to take refuge in a\r\nneighbouring wood, they took them all (with Iphigenia) and brought them\r\nto the farm. Whence, pursuant to an order of the Senate of Rhodes, to\r\nwhich, so soon as he received the news, Pasimondas made his complaint,\r\nCimon and his men were all marched off to prison by Lysimachus, chief\r\nmagistrate of the Rhodians for that year, who came down from the city for\r\nthe purpose with an exceeding great company of men at arms. On such wise\r\ndid our hapless and enamoured Cimon lose his so lately won Iphigenia\r\nbefore he had had of her more than a kiss or two. Iphigenia was\r\nentertained and comforted of the annoy, occasioned as well by her recent\r\ncapture as by the fury of the sea, by not a few noble ladies of Rhodes,\r\nwith whom she tarried until the day appointed for her marriage. In\r\nrecompense of the release of the Rhodian gallants on the preceding day\r\nthe lives of Cimon and his men were spared, notwithstanding that\r\nPasimondas pressed might and main for their execution; and instead they\r\nwere condemned to perpetual imprisonment: wherein, as may be supposed,\r\nthey abode in dolorous plight, and despaired of ever again knowing\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nHowever, it so befell that, Pasimondas accelerating his nuptials to the\r\nbest of his power, Fortune, as if repenting her that in her haste she had\r\ndone Cimon so evil a turn, did now by a fresh disposition of events\r\ncompass his deliverance. Pasimondas had a brother, by name Hormisdas, his\r\nequal in all respects save in years, who had long been contract to marry\r\nCassandra, a fair and noble damsel of Rhodes, of whom Lysimachus was in\r\nthe last degree enamoured; but owing to divers accidents the marriage had\r\nbeen from time to time put off. Now Pasimondas, being about to celebrate\r\nhis nuptials with exceeding great pomp, bethought him that he could not\r\ndo better than, to avoid a repetition of the pomp and expense, arrange,\r\nif so he might, that his brother should be wedded on the same day with\r\nhimself. So, having consulted anew with Cassandra's kinsfolk, and come to\r\nan understanding with them, he and his brother and they conferred\r\ntogether, and agreed that on the same day that Pasimondas married\r\nIphigenia, Hormisdas should marry Cassandra. Lysimachus, getting wind of\r\nthis arrangement, was mortified beyond measure, seeing himself thereby\r\ndeprived of the hope which he cherished of marrying Cassandra himself, if\r\nHormisdas should not forestall him. But like a wise man he concealed his\r\nchagrin, and cast about how he might frustrate the arrangement: to which\r\nend he saw no other possible means but to carry Cassandra off. It did not\r\nescape him that the office which he held would render this easily\r\nfeasible, but he deemed it all the more dishonourable than if he had not\r\nheld the office; but, in short, after much pondering, honour yielded\r\nplace to love, and he made up his mind that, come what might, he would\r\ncarry Cassandra off. Then, as he took thought what company he should take\r\nwith him, and how he should go about the affair, he remembered Cimon,\r\nwhom he had in prison with his men, and it occurred to him that he could\r\nnot possibly have a better or more trusty associate in such an enterprise\r\nthan Cimon. Wherefore the same night he caused Cimon to be brought\r\nprivily to him in his own room, and thus addressed him:--\"Cimon, as the\r\ngods are most generous and liberal to bestow their gifts on men, so are\r\nthey also most sagacious to try their virtue; and those whom they find to\r\nbe firm and steadfast in all circumstances they honour, as the most\r\nworthy, with the highest rewards. They have been minded to be certified\r\nof thy worth by better proofs than thou couldst afford them, as long as\r\nthy life was bounded by thy father's house amid the superabundant wealth\r\nwhich I know him to possess: wherefore in the first place they so wrought\r\nupon thee with the shrewd incitements of Love that from an insensate\r\nbrute, as I have heard, thou grewest to be a man; since when, it has been\r\nand is their intent to try whether evil fortune and harsh imprisonment\r\nmay avail to change thee from the temper that was thine when for a short\r\nwhile thou hadst joyance of the prize thou hadst won. And so thou prove\r\nthe same that thou wast then, they have in store for thee a boon\r\nincomparably greater than aught that they vouchsafed thee before: what\r\nthat boon is, to the end thou mayst recover heart and thy wonted\r\nenergies, I will now explain to thee. Pasimondas, exultant in thy\r\nmisfortune and eager to compass thy death, hastens to the best of his\r\npower his nuptials with thy Iphigenia; that so he may enjoy the prize\r\nthat Fortune, erstwhile smiling, gave thee, and forthwith, frowning, reft\r\nfrom thee. Whereat how sore must be thy grief, if rightly I gauge thy\r\nlove, I know by my own case, seeing that his brother Hormisdas addresses\r\nhimself to do me on the same day a like wrong in regard of Cassandra,\r\nwhom I love more than aught else in the world. Nor see I that Fortune has\r\nleft us any way of escape from this her unjust and cruel spite, save what\r\nwe may make for ourselves by a resolved spirit and the might of our right\r\nhands: take we then the sword, and therewith make we, each, prize of his\r\nlady, thou for the second, I for the first time: for so thou value the\r\nrecovery, I say not of thy liberty, for without thy lady I doubt thou\r\nwouldst hold it cheap, but of thy lady, the gods have placed it in thine\r\nown hands, if thou art but minded to join me in my enterprise.\"\r\n\r\nThese words restored to Cimon all that he had lost of heart and hope, nor\r\npondered he long, before he replied:--\"Lysimachus, comrade stouter or\r\nmore staunch than I thou mightst not have in such an enterprise, if such\r\nindeed it be as thou sayst: wherefore lay upon me such behest as thou\r\nshalt deem meet, and thou shalt marvel to witness the vigour of my\r\nperformance.\" Whereupon Lysimachus:--\"On the third day from now,\" quoth\r\nhe, \"their husbands' houses will be newly entered by the brides, and on\r\nthe same day at even we too will enter them in arms, thou with thy men,\r\nand I with some of mine, in whom I place great trust, and forcing our way\r\namong the guests and slaughtering all that dare to oppose us, will bear\r\nthe ladies off to a ship which I have had privily got ready.\" Cimon\r\napproved the plan, and kept quiet in prison until the appointed time;\r\nwhich being come, the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp and\r\nmagnificence, that filled the houses of the two brothers with festal\r\ncheer. Then Lysimachus having made ready all things meet, and fired Cimon\r\nand his men and his own friends for the enterprise by a long harangue,\r\ndisposed them in due time, all bearing arms under their cloaks, in three\r\ncompanies; and having privily despatched one company to the port, that,\r\nwhen the time should come to embark, he might meet with no let, he\r\nmarched with the other two companies to the house of Pasimondas, posted\r\nthe one company at the gate, that, being entered, they might not be shut\r\nin or debarred their egress, and, with the other company and Cimon,\r\nascended the stairs, and gained the saloon, where the brides and not a\r\nfew other ladies were set at several tables to sup in meet order:\r\nwhereupon in they rushed, and overthrew the tables and seized each his\r\nown lady, and placed them in charge of their men, whom they bade bear\r\nthem off forthwith to the ship that lay ready to receive them. Whereupon\r\nthe brides and the other ladies and the servants with one accord fell a\r\nsobbing and shrieking, insomuch that a confused din and lamentation\r\nfilled the whole place. Cimon, Lysimachus and their band, none\r\nwithstanding, but all giving way before them, gained the stairs, which\r\nthey were already descending when they encountered Pasimondas, who,\r\ncarrying a great staff in his hand, was making in the direction of the\r\nnoise; but one doughty stroke of Cimon's sword sufficed to cleave his\r\nskull in twain, and lay him dead at Cimon's feet, and another stroke\r\ndisposed of hapless Hormisdas, as he came running to his brother's aid.\r\nSome others who ventured to approach them were wounded and beaten off by\r\nthe retinue. So forth of the house, that reeked with blood and resounded\r\nwith tumult and lamentation and woe, sped Simon and Lysimachus with all\r\ntheir company, and without any let, in close order, with their fair booty\r\nin their midst, made good their retreat to the ship; whereon with the\r\nladies they one and all embarked, for the shore was now full of armed men\r\ncome to rescue the ladies, and, the oarsmen giving way, put to sea elate.\r\nArrived at Crete, they met with a hearty welcome on the part of their\r\nmany friends and kinsfolk; and, having married their ladies, they made\r\ngreatly merry, and had gladsome joyance of their fair booty. Their doings\r\noccasioned, both in Cyprus and in Rhodes, no small stir and commotion,\r\nwhich lasted for a long while: but in the end, by the good offices of\r\ntheir friends and kinsfolk in both islands, 'twas so ordered as that\r\nafter a certain term of exile Cimon returned with Iphigenia to Cyprus,\r\nand in like manner Lysimachus returned with Cassandra to Rhodes; and long\r\nand blithely thereafter lived they, each well contented with his own wife\r\nin his own land.\r\n\r\n(1) One of the augmentative forms of bestia.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL II.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGostanza loves Martuccio Gomito, and hearing that he is dead, gives way\r\nto despair, and hies her alone aboard a boat, which is wafted by the wind\r\nto Susa. She finds him alive in Tunis, and makes herself known to him,\r\nwho, having by his counsel gained high place in the king's favour,\r\nmarries her, and returns with her wealthy to Lipari.\r\n--\r\n\r\nPamfilo's story being ended, the queen, after commending it not a little,\r\ncalled for one to follow from Emilia; who thus began:--\r\n\r\nMeet and right it is that one should rejoice when events so fall out that\r\npassion meets with its due reward: and as love merits in the long run\r\nrather joy than suffering, far gladlier obey I the queen's than I did the\r\nking's behest, and address myself to our present theme. You are to know\r\nthen, dainty ladies, that not far from Sicily there is an islet called\r\nLipari, in which, no great while ago, there dwelt a damsel, Gostanza by\r\nname, fair as fair could be, and of one of the most honourable families\r\nin the island. And one Martuccio Gomito, who was also of the island, a\r\nyoung man most gallant and courteous, and worthy for his condition,\r\nbecame enamoured of Gostanza; who in like manner grew so afire for him\r\nthat she was ever ill at ease, except she saw him. Martuccio, craving her\r\nto wife, asked her of her father, who made answer that, Martuccio being\r\npoor, he was not minded to give her to him. Mortified to be thus rejected\r\nby reason of poverty, Martuccio took an oath in presence of some of his\r\nfriends and kinsfolk that Lipari should know him no more, until he was\r\nwealthy. So away he sailed, and took to scouring the seas as a rover on\r\nthe coast of Barbary, preying upon all whose force matched not his own.\r\nIn which way of life he found Fortune favourable enough, had he but known\r\nhow to rest and be thankful: but 'twas not enough that he and his\r\ncomrades in no long time waxed very wealthy; their covetousness was\r\ninordinate, and, while they sought to gratify it, they chanced in an\r\nencounter with certain Saracen ships to be taken after a long defence,\r\nand despoiled, and, most part of them, thrown into the sea by their\r\ncaptors, who, after sinking his ship, took Martuccio with them to Tunis,\r\nand clapped him in prison, and there kept him a long time in a very sad\r\nplight.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, not by one or two, but by divers and not a few persons,\r\ntidings reached Lipari that all that were with Martuccio aboard his bark\r\nhad perished in the sea. The damsel, whose grief on Martuccio's departure\r\nhad known no bounds, now hearing that he was dead with the rest, wept a\r\ngreat while, and made up her mind to have done with life; but, lacking\r\nthe resolution to lay violent hands upon herself, she bethought her how\r\nshe might devote herself to death by some novel expedient. So one night\r\nshe stole out of her father's house, and hied her to the port, and there\r\nby chance she found, lying a little apart from the other craft, a fishing\r\nboat, which, as the owners had but just quitted her, was still equipped\r\nwith mast and sails and oars. Aboard which boat she forthwith got, and\r\nbeing, like most of the women of the island, not altogether without\r\nnautical skill, she rowed some distance out to sea, and then hoisted\r\nsail, and cast away oars and tiller, and let the boat drift, deeming that\r\na boat without lading or steersman would certainly be either capsized by\r\nthe wind or dashed against some rock and broken in pieces, so that escape\r\nshe could not, even if she would, but must perforce drown. And so, her\r\nhead wrapped in a mantle, she stretched herself weeping on the floor of\r\nthe boat. But it fell out quite otherwise than she had conjectured: for,\r\nthe wind being from the north, and very equable, with next to no sea, the\r\nboat kept an even keel, and next day about vespers bore her to land hard\r\nby a city called Susa, full a hundred miles beyond Tunis. To the damsel\r\n'twas all one whether she were at sea or ashore, for, since she had been\r\naboard, she had never once raised, nor, come what might, meant she ever\r\nto raise, her head.\r\n\r\nNow it so chanced, that, when the boat grounded, there was on the shore a\r\npoor woman that was in the employ of some fishermen, whose nets she was\r\njust taking out of the sunlight. Seeing the boat under full sail, she\r\nmarvelled how it should be suffered to drive ashore, and conjectured that\r\nthe fishermen on board were asleep. So to the boat she hied her, and\r\nfinding therein only the damsel fast asleep, she called her many times,\r\nand at length awakened her; and perceiving by her dress that she was a\r\nChristian, she asked her in Latin how it was that she was come thither\r\nall alone in the boat. Hearing the Latin speech, the damsel wondered\r\nwhether the wind had not shifted, and carried her back to Lipari: so up\r\nshe started, gazed about her, and finding herself ashore and the aspect\r\nof the country strange, asked the good woman where she was. To which the\r\ngood woman made answer:--\"My daughter, thou art hard by Susa in Barbary.\"\r\nWhereupon the damsel, sorrowful that God had not seen fit to accord her\r\nthe boon of death, apprehensive of dishonour, and at her wits' end, sat\r\nherself down at the foot of her boat, and burst into tears. Which the\r\ngood woman saw not without pity, and persuaded her to come with her into\r\nher hut, and there by coaxing drew from her how she was come thither; and\r\nknowing that she could not but be fasting, she set before her her own\r\ncoarse bread and some fish and water, and prevailed upon her to eat a\r\nlittle. Gostanza thereupon asked her, who she was that thus spoke Latin;\r\nwhereto she answered that her name was Carapresa, and that she was from\r\nTrapani, where she had served some Christian fishermen. To the damsel,\r\nsad indeed though she was, this name Carapresa, wherefore she knew not,\r\nseemed to be of happy augury, so that she began to take hope, she knew\r\nnot why, and to grow somewhat less fain of death: wherefore without\r\ndisclosing who or whence she was, she earnestly besought the good woman\r\nfor the love of God to have pity on her youth, and advise her how best to\r\navoid insult. Whereupon Carapresa, good woman that she was, left her in\r\nher hut, while with all speed she picked up her nets; and on her return\r\nshe wrapped her in her own mantle, and led her to Susa. Arrived there,\r\nshe said to her:--\"Gostanza, I shall bring thee to the house of an\r\nexcellent Saracen lady, for whom I frequently do bits of work, as she has\r\noccasion: she is an old lady and compassionate: I will commend thee to\r\nher care as best I may, and I doubt not she will right gladly receive\r\nthee, and entreat thee as her daughter: and thou wilt serve her, and,\r\nwhile thou art with her, do all thou canst to gain her favour, until such\r\ntime as God may send thee better fortune;\" and as she said, so she did.\r\n\r\nThe old lady listened, and then, gazing steadfastly in the damsel's face,\r\nshed tears, and taking her hand, kissed her forehead, and led her into\r\nthe house, where she and some other women dwelt quite by themselves,\r\ndoing divers kinds of handiwork in silk and palm leaves and leather.\r\nWherein the damsel in a few days acquired some skill, and thenceforth\r\nwrought together with them; and rose wondrous high in the favour and good\r\ngraces of all the ladies, who soon taught her their language.\r\n\r\nNow while the damsel, mourned at home as lost and dead, dwelt thus at\r\nSusa, it so befell that, Mariabdela being then King of Tunis, a young\r\nchieftain in Granada, of great power, and backed by mighty allies, gave\r\nout that the realm of Tunis belonged to him, and having gathered a vast\r\narmy, made a descent upon Tunis with intent to expel the King from the\r\nrealm. Martuccio Gomito, who knew the language of Barbary well, heard the\r\ntidings in prison, and learning that the King of Tunis was mustering a\r\nmighty host for the defence of his kingdom, said to one of the warders\r\nthat were in charge of him and his comrades:--\"If I might have speech of\r\nthe King, I am confident that the advice that I should give him would\r\nsecure him the victory.\" The warder repeated these words to his chief,\r\nwho forthwith carried them to the King. Wherefore by the King's command\r\nMartuccio was brought before him, and being asked by him what the advice,\r\nof which he had spoken, might be, answered on this wise:--\"Sire, if in\r\nold days, when I was wont to visit this country of yours, I duly observed\r\nthe manner in which you order your battle, methinks you place your main\r\nreliance upon archers; and therefore, if you could contrive that your\r\nenemy's supply of arrows should give out and your own continue plentiful,\r\nI apprehend that you would win the battle.\" \"Ay indeed,\" replied the\r\nKing, \"I make no doubt that, could I but accomplish that, I should\r\nconquer.\" \"Nay but, Sire,\" returned Martuccio, \"you may do it, if you\r\nwill. Listen, and I will tell you how. You must fit the bows of your\r\narchers with strings much finer than those that are in common use, and\r\nmatch them with arrows, the notches of which will not admit any but these\r\nfine strings; and this you must do so secretly that your enemy may not\r\nknow it, else he will find means to be even with you. Which counsel I\r\ngive you for the following reason:--When your and your enemy's archers\r\nhave expended all their arrows, you wot that the enemy will fall to\r\npicking up the arrows that your men have shot during the battle, and your\r\nmen will do the like by the enemy's arrows; but the enemy will not be\r\nable to make use of your men's arrows, by reason that their fine notches\r\nwill not suffice to admit the stout strings, whereas your men will be in\r\nthe contrary case in regard of the enemy's arrows, for the fine string\r\nwill very well receive the large-notched arrow, and so your men will have\r\nan abundant supply of arrows, while the enemy will be at a loss for\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe King, who lacked not sagacity, appreciated Martuccio's advice, and\r\ngave full effect to it; whereby he came out of the war a conqueror, and\r\nMartuccio, being raised to the chief place in his favour, waxed rich and\r\npowerful. Which matters being bruited throughout the country, it came to\r\nthe ears of Gostanza that Martuccio Gomito, whom she had long supposed to\r\nbe dead, was alive; whereby her love for him, some embers of which still\r\nlurked in her heart, burst forth again in sudden flame, and gathered\r\nstrength, and revived her dead hope. Wherefore she frankly told all her\r\ncase to the good lady with whom she dwelt, saying that she would fain go\r\nto Tunis, that her eyes might have assurance of that which the report\r\nreceived by her ears had made them yearn to see. The lady fell heartily\r\nin with the girl's desire, and, as if she had been her mother, embarked\r\nwith her for Tunis, where on their arrival they were honourably received\r\nin the house of one of her kinswomen. Carapresa, who had attended her,\r\nbeing sent to discover what she might touching Martuccio, brought back\r\nword that he was alive, and high in honour and place. The gentlewoman was\r\nminded that none but herself should apprise Martuccio of the arrival of\r\nhis Gostanza: wherefore she hied her one day to Martuccio, and\r\nsaid:--\"Martuccio, there is come to my house a servant of thine from\r\nLipari, who would fain speak with thee here privily, and for that he\r\nwould not have me trust another, I am come hither myself to deliver his\r\nmessage.\" Martuccio thanked her, and forthwith hied him with her to her\r\nhouse: where no sooner did the girl see him than she all but died for\r\njoy, and carried away by her feelings, fell upon his neck with open arms\r\nand embraced him, and, what with sorrow of his past woes and her present\r\nhappiness, said never a word, but softly wept. Martuccio regarded her for\r\na while in silent wonder; then, heaving a sigh, he said:--\"Thou livest\r\nthen, my Gostanza? Long since I heard that thou wast lost; nor was aught\r\nknown of thee at home.\" Which said, he tenderly and with tears embraced\r\nher. Gostanza told him all her adventures, and how honourably she had\r\nbeen entreated by the gentlewoman with whom she had dwelt. And so long\r\ntime they conversed, and then Martuccio parted from her, and hied him\r\nback to his lord the King, and told him all, to wit, his own adventures\r\nand those of the girl, adding that with his leave he was minded to marry\r\nher according to our law. Which matters the King found passing strange;\r\nand having called the girl to him, and learned from her that 'twas even\r\nas Martuccio had said:--\"Well indeed,\" quoth he, \"hast thou won thy\r\nhusband.\" Then caused he gifts most ample and excellent to be brought\r\nforth, part of which he gave to Gostanza, and part to Martuccio, leaving\r\nthem entirely to their own devices in regard of one another. Then\r\nMartuccio, in terms most honourable, bade farewell to the old lady with\r\nwhom Gostanza had dwelt, thanking her for the service she had rendered to\r\nGostanza, and giving her presents suited to her condition, and commending\r\nher to God, while Gostanza shed many a tear: after which, by leave of the\r\nKing, they went aboard a light bark, taking with them Carapresa, and,\r\nsped by a prosperous breeze, arrived at Lipari, where they were received\r\nwith such cheer as 'twere vain to attempt to describe. There were\r\nMartuccio and Gostanza wedded with all pomp and splendour; and there long\r\ntime in easeful peace they had joyance of their love.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL III.\r\n\r\n--\r\nPietro Boccamazza runs away with Agnolella, and encounters a gang of\r\nrobbers: the girl takes refuge in a wood, and is guided to a castle.\r\nPietro is taken, but escapes out of the hands of the robbers, and after\r\nsome adventures arrives at the castle where Agnolella is, marries her,\r\nand returns with her to Rome.\r\n--\r\n\r\nEnded Emilia's story, which none of the company spared to commend, the\r\nqueen, turning to Elisa, bade her follow suit; and she, with glad\r\nobedience, thus began:--\r\n\r\n'Tis a story, sweet ladies, of a woeful night passed by two indiscreet\r\nyoung lovers that I have in mind; but, as thereon ensued not a few days\r\nof joy, 'tis not inapposite to our argument, and shall be narrated.\r\n\r\n'Tis no long time since at Rome, which, albeit now the tail,(1) was of\r\nyore the head, of the world, there dwelt a young man, Pietro Boccamazza\r\nby name, a scion of one of the most illustrious of the Roman houses, who\r\nbecame enamoured of a damsel exceeding fair, and amorous withal--her name\r\nAgnolella--the daughter of one Gigliuozzo Saullo, a plebeian, but in high\r\nrepute among the Romans. Nor, loving thus, did Pietro lack the address to\r\ninspire in Agnolella a love as ardent as his own. Wherefore, overmastered\r\nby his passion, and minded no longer to endure the sore suffering that it\r\ncaused him, he asked her in marriage. Whereof his kinsfolk were no sooner\r\napprised, than with one accord they came to him and strongly urged him to\r\ndesist from his purpose: they also gave Gigliuozzo Saullo to understand\r\nthat he were best to pay no sort of heed to Pietro's words, for that, if\r\nhe so did, they would never acknowledge him as friend or relative. Thus\r\nto see himself debarred of the one way by which he deemed he might attain\r\nto his desire, Pietro was ready to die for grief, and, all his kinsfolk\r\nnotwithstanding, he would have married Gigliuozzo's daughter, had but the\r\nfather consented. Wherefore at length he made up his mind that, if the\r\ngirl were willing, nought should stand in the way; and having through a\r\ncommon friend sounded the damsel and found her apt, he brought her to\r\nconsent to elope with him from Rome. The affair being arranged, Pietro\r\nand she took horse betimes one morning, and sallied forth for Anagni,\r\nwhere Pietro had certain friends, in whom he placed much trust; and as\r\nthey rode, time not serving for full joyance of their love, for they\r\nfeared pursuit, they held converse thereof, and from time to time\r\nexchanged a kiss. Now it so befell, that, the way being none too well\r\nknown to Pietro, when, perhaps eight miles from Rome, they should have\r\nturned to the right, they took instead a leftward road. Whereon when they\r\nhad ridden but little more than two miles, they found themselves close to\r\na petty castle, whence, so soon as they were observed, there issued some\r\ndozen men at arms; and, as they drew near, the damsel, espying them, gave\r\na cry, and said:--\"We are attacked, Pietro, let us flee;\" and guiding her\r\nnag as best she knew towards a great forest, she planted the spurs in his\r\nsides, and so, holding on by the saddle-bow, was borne by the goaded\r\ncreature into the forest at a gallop. Pietro, who had been too engrossed\r\nwith her face to give due heed to the way, and thus had not been ware, as\r\nsoon as she, of the approach of the men at arms, was still looking about\r\nto see whence they were coming, when they came up with him, and took him\r\nprisoner, and forced him to dismount. Then they asked who he was, and,\r\nwhen he told them, they conferred among themselves, saying:--\"This is one\r\nof the friends of our enemies: what else can we do but relieve him of his\r\nnag and of his clothes, and hang him on one of these oaks in scorn of the\r\nOrsini?\" To which proposal all agreeing, they bade Pietro strip himself:\r\nbut while, already divining his fate, he was so doing, an ambuscade of\r\nfull five-and-twenty men at arms fell suddenly upon them,\r\ncrying:--\"Death, death!\" Thus surprised, they let Pietro go, and stood on\r\nthe defensive; but, seeing that the enemy greatly outnumbered them, they\r\ntook to their heels, the others giving chase. Whereupon Pietro hastily\r\nresumed his clothes, mounted his nag, and fled with all speed in the\r\ndirection which he had seen the damsel take. But finding no road or path\r\nthrough the forest, nor discerning any trace of a horse's hooves, he\r\nwas--for that he found not the damsel--albeit he deemed himself safe out\r\nof the clutches of his captors and their assailants, the most wretched\r\nman alive, and fell a weeping and wandering hither and thither about the\r\nforest, uttering Agnolella's name. None answered; but turn back he dared\r\nnot: so on he went, not knowing whither he went; besides which, he was in\r\nmortal dread of the wild beasts that infest the forest, as well on\r\naccount of himself as of the damsel, whom momently he seemed to see\r\nthrottled by some bear or wolf. Thus did our unfortunate Pietro spend the\r\nwhole day, wandering about the forest, making it to resound with his\r\ncries of Agnolella's name, and harking at times back, when he thought to\r\ngo forward; until at last, what with his cries and his tears and his\r\nfears and his long fasting, he was so spent that he could go no further.\r\n'Twas then nightfall, and, as he knew not what else to do, he dismounted\r\nat the foot of an immense oak, and having tethered his nag to the trunk,\r\nclimbed up into the branches, lest he should be devoured by the wild\r\nbeasts during the night. Shortly afterwards the moon rose with a very\r\nclear sky, and Pietro, who dared not sleep, lest he should fall, and\r\nindeed, had he been secure from that risk, his misery and his anxiety on\r\naccount of the damsel would not have suffered him to sleep, kept watch,\r\nsighing and weeping and cursing his evil luck.\r\n\r\nNow the damsel, who, as we said before, had fled she knew not whither,\r\nallowing her nag to carry her whithersoever he would, strayed so far into\r\nthe forest that she lost sight of the place where she had entered it, and\r\nspent the whole day just as Pietro had done, wandering about the\r\nwilderness, pausing from time to time, and weeping, and uttering his\r\nname, and bewailing her evil fortune. At last, seeing that 'twas now the\r\nvesper hour and Pietro came not, she struck into a path, which the nag\r\nfollowed, until, after riding some two miles, she espied at some distance\r\na cottage, for which she made with all speed, and found there a good man,\r\nwell stricken in years, with his wife, who was likewise aged. Seeing her\r\nride up alone, they said:--\"Daughter, wherefore ridest thou thus alone at\r\nthis hour in these parts?\" Weeping, the damsel made answer that she had\r\nlost her companion in the forest, and asked how far might Anagni be from\r\nthere? \"My daughter,\" returned the good man, \"this is not the road to\r\nAnagni; 'tis more than twelve miles away.\" \"And how far off,\" inquired\r\nthe damsel, \"are the nearest houses in which one might find lodging for\r\nthe night?\" \"There are none so near,\" replied the good man, \"that thou\r\ncanst reach them to-day.\" \"Then, so please you,\" said the damsel, \"since\r\ngo elsewhither I cannot, for God's sake let me pass the night here with\r\nyou.\" Whereto the good man made answer:--\"Damsel, welcome art thou to\r\ntarry the night with us; but still thou art to know that these parts are\r\ninfested both by day and by night by bands, which, be they friends or be\r\nthey foes, are alike ill to meet with, and not seldom do much despite and\r\nmischief, and if by misadventure one of these bands should visit us while\r\nthou wert here, and marking thy youth and beauty should do thee despite\r\nand dishonour, we should be unable to afford thee any succour. This we\r\nwould have thee know, that if it should so come to pass, thou mayst not\r\nhave cause to reproach us.\" The damsel heard not the old man's words\r\nwithout dismay; but, seeing that the hour was now late, she\r\nanswered:--\"God, if He be so pleased, will save both you and me from such\r\nmolestation, and if not, 'tis a much lesser evil to be maltreated by men\r\nthan to be torn in pieces by the wild beasts in the forest.\" So saying,\r\nshe dismounted, and entered the cottage, where, having supped with the\r\npoor man and his wife on such humble fare as they had, she laid herself\r\nin her clothes beside them in their bed. She slept not, however; for her\r\nown evil plight and that of Pietro, for whom she knew not how to augur\r\naught but evil, kept her sighing and weeping all night long. And towards\r\nmatins she heard a great noise as of men that marched; so up she got and\r\nhied her into a large courtyard that was in rear of the cottage, and part\r\nof which was covered with a great heap of hay, which she espying, hid\r\nherself therein, that, if the men came there, they might not so readily\r\nfind her. Scarce had she done so than the men, who proved to be a strong\r\ncompany of marauders, were at the door of the cottage, which they forced\r\nopen; and having entered, and found the damsel's nag, still saddled, they\r\nasked who was there. The damsel being out of sight, the good man\r\nanswered:--\"There is none here but my wife and I; but this nag, which has\r\ngiven some one the slip, found his way hither last night, and we housed\r\nhim, lest he should be devoured by the wolves.\" \"So!\" said the chief of\r\nthe band, \"as he has no owner, he will come in very handy for us.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon, in several parties, they ransacked the cottage from top to\r\nbottom; and one party went out into the courtyard, where, as they threw\r\naside their lances and targets, it so befell that one of them, not\r\nknowing where else to bestow his lance, tossed it into the hay, and was\r\nwithin an ace of killing the damsel that lay hid there, as likewise she\r\nof betraying her whereabouts, for the lance all but grazing her left\r\nbreast, insomuch that the head tore her apparel, she doubted she was\r\nwounded, and had given a great shriek, but that, remembering where she\r\nwas, she refrained for fear. By and by the company cooked them a\r\nbreakfast of kid's and other meat, and having eaten and drunken,\r\ndispersed in divers directions, as their affairs required, taking the\r\ngirl's nag with them. And when they were gotten some little way off, the\r\ngood man asked his wife:--\"What became of the damsel, our guest of last\r\nnight, that I have not seen her since we rose?\" The good woman answered\r\nthat she knew not where the damsel was, and went to look for her. The\r\ndamsel, discovering that the men were gone, came forth of the hay, and\r\nthe good man, seeing her, was overjoyed that she had not fallen into the\r\nhands of the ruffians, and, as day was breaking, said to her:--\"Now that\r\nday is at hand, we will, so it like thee, escort thee to a castle, some\r\nfive miles hence, where thou wilt be in safety; but thou must needs go\r\nafoot, because these villains, that are but just gone, have taken thy nag\r\nwith them.\" The damsel, resigning herself to her loss, besought them for\r\nGod's sake to take her to the castle: whereupon they set forth, and\r\narrived there about half tierce. Now the castle belonged to one of the\r\nOrsini, Liello di Campo di Fiore by name, whose wife, as it chanced, was\r\nthere. A most kindly and good woman she was, and, recognizing the damsel\r\nas soon as she saw her, gave her a hearty welcome and would fain have\r\nfrom her a particular account of how she came there. So the damsel told\r\nher the whole story. The lady, to whom Pietro was also known, as being a\r\nfriend of her husband, was distressed to hear of his misadventure, and\r\nbeing told where he was taken, gave him up for dead. So she said to the\r\ndamsel:--\"Since so it is that thou knowest not how Pietro has fared, thou\r\nshalt stay here with me until such time as I may have opportunity to send\r\nthee safely back to Rome.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pietro, perched on his oak in as woeful a plight as might be,\r\nhad espied, when he should have been in his first sleep, a full score of\r\nwolves, that, as they prowled, caught sight of the nag, and straightway\r\nwere upon him on all sides. The horse, as soon as he was ware of their\r\napproach, strained on the reins till they snapped, and tried to make good\r\nhis escape; but, being hemmed in, was brought to bay, and made a long\r\nfight of it with his teeth and hooves; but in the end they bore him down\r\nand throttled him and forthwith eviscerated him, and, the whole pack\r\nfalling upon him, devoured him to the bone before they had done with him.\r\nWhereat Pietro, who felt that in the nag he had lost a companion and a\r\ncomfort in his travail, was sorely dismayed, and began to think that he\r\nshould never get out of the forest. But towards dawn, he, perched there\r\nin the oak, almost dead with cold, looking around him as he frequently\r\ndid, espied about a mile off a huge fire. Wherefore, as soon as 'twas\r\nbroad day, he got down, not without trepidation, from the oak, and bent\r\nhis steps towards the fire; and being come to it, he found, gathered\r\nabout it, a company of shepherds, eating and making merry, who took pity\r\non him and made him welcome. And when he had broken his fast and warmed\r\nhimself, he told them the mishap that had befallen him, and how it was\r\nthat he was come there alone, and asked them if there was a farm or\r\ncastle in those parts, whither he might betake him. The shepherds said\r\nthat about three miles away there was a castle belonging to Liello di\r\nCampo di Fiore, where his lady was then tarrying. Pietro, much comforted,\r\nrequested to be guided thither by some of their company; whereupon two of\r\nthem right gladly escorted him. So Pietro arrived at the castle, where he\r\nfound some that knew him; and while he was endeavouring to set on foot a\r\nsearch for the damsel in the forest, the lady summoned him to her\r\npresence, and he, forthwith obeying, and seeing Agnolella with her, was\r\nthe happiest man that ever was. He yearned till he all but swooned to go\r\nand embrace her, but refrained, for bashfulness, in the lady's presence.\r\nAnd overjoyed as he was, the joy of the damsel was no less. The lady\r\nreceived him with great cheer, and though, when she had heard the story\r\nof his adventures from his own lips, she chid him not a little for having\r\nset at nought the wishes of his kinsfolk; yet, seeing that he was still\r\nof the same mind, and that the damsel was also constant, she said to\r\nherself:--To what purpose give I myself all this trouble? they love one\r\nanother, they know one another; they love with equal ardour; their love\r\nis honourable, and I doubt not is well pleasing to God, seeing that the\r\none has escaped the gallows and the other the lance, and both the wild\r\nbeasts: wherefore be it as they would have it. Then, turning to them, she\r\nsaid:--\"If 'tis your will to be joined in wedlock as man and wife, mine\r\njumps with it: here shall your nuptials be solemnized and at Liello's\r\ncharges, and for the rest I will see that your peace is made with your\r\nkinsfolk.\" So in the castle the pair were wedded, Pietro only less blithe\r\nthan Agnolella, the lady ordering the nuptials as honourably as might be\r\nin her mountain-home, and there they had most sweet joyance of the first\r\nfruits of their love. So some days they tarried there, and then\r\naccompanied by the lady with a strong escort, they took horse and\r\nreturned to Rome, where, very wroth though she found Pietro's kinsfolk\r\nfor what he had done, the lady re-established solid peace between him and\r\nthem; and so at Rome Pietro and Agnolella lived together to a good old\r\nage in great tranquillity and happiness.\r\n\r\n(1) In reference to the forlorn condition of the city while the seat of\r\nthe papacy was at Avignon, 1308-1377.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IV.\r\n\r\n--\r\nRicciardo Manardi is found by Messer Lizio da Valbona with his daughter,\r\nwhom he marries, and remains at peace with her father.\r\n--\r\n\r\nIn silence Elisa received the praise bestowed on her story by her fair\r\ncompanions; and then the queen called for a story from Filostrato, who\r\nwith a laugh began on this wise:--Chidden have I been so often and by so\r\nmany of you for the sore burden, which I laid upon you, of discourse\r\nharsh and meet for tears, that, as some compensation for such annoy, I\r\ndeem myself bound to tell you somewhat that may cause you to laugh a\r\nlittle: wherefore my story, which will be of the briefest, shall be of a\r\nlove, the course whereof, save for sighs and a brief passage of fear\r\nmingled with shame, ran smooth to a happy consummation.\r\n\r\nKnow then, noble ladies, that 'tis no long time since there dwelt in\r\nRomagna a right worthy and courteous knight, Messer Lizio da Valbona by\r\nname, who was already verging upon old age, when, as it happened, there\r\nwas born to him of his wife, Madonna Giacomina, a daughter, who, as she\r\ngrew up, became the fairest and most debonair of all the girls of those\r\nparts, and, for that she was the only daughter left to them, was most\r\ndearly loved and cherished by her father and mother, who guarded her with\r\nmost jealous care, thinking to arrange some great match for her. Now\r\nthere was frequently in Messer Lizio's house, and much in his company, a\r\nfine, lusty young man, one Ricciardo de' Manardi da Brettinoro, whom\r\nMesser Lizio and his wife would as little have thought of mistrusting as\r\nif he had been their own son: who, now and again taking note of the\r\ndamsel, that she was very fair and graceful, and in bearing and behaviour\r\nmost commendable, and of marriageable age, fell vehemently in love with\r\nher, which love he was very careful to conceal. The damsel detected it,\r\nhowever, and in like manner plunged headlong into love with him, to\r\nRicciardo's no small satisfaction. Again and again he was on the point of\r\nspeaking to her, but refrained for fear; at length, however, he summoned\r\nup his courage, and seizing his opportunity, thus addressed\r\nher:--\"Caterina, I implore thee, suffer me not to die for love of thee.\"\r\nWhereto the damsel forthwith responded:--\"Nay, God grant that it be not\r\nrather that I die for love of thee.\" Greatly exhilarated and encouraged,\r\nRicciardo made answer:--\"'Twill never be by default of mine that thou\r\nlackest aught that may pleasure thee; but it rests with thee to find the\r\nmeans to save thy life and mine.\" Then said the damsel:--\"Thou seest,\r\nRicciardo, how closely watched I am, insomuch that I see not how 'twere\r\npossible for thee to come to me; but if thou seest aught that I may do\r\nwithout dishonour, speak the word, and I will do it.\" Ricciardo was\r\nsilent a while, pondering many matters: then, of a sudden, he\r\nsaid:--\"Sweet my Caterina, there is but one way that I can see, to wit,\r\nthat thou shouldst sleep either on or where thou mightst have access to\r\nthe terrace by thy father's garden, where, so I but knew that thou\r\nwouldst be there at night, I would without fail contrive to meet thee,\r\nalbeit 'tis very high.\" \"As for my sleeping there,\" replied Caterina, \"I\r\ndoubt not that it may be managed, if thou art sure that thou canst join\r\nme.\" Ricciardo answered in the affirmative. Whereupon they exchanged a\r\nfurtive kiss, and parted.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, it being now towards the close of May, the damsel began\r\ncomplaining to her mother that by reason of the excessive heat she had\r\nnot been able to get any sleep during the night. \"Daughter,\" said the\r\nlady, \"what heat was there? Nay, there was no heat at all.\" \"Had you\r\nsaid, 'to my thinking,' mother,\" rejoined Caterina, \"you would perhaps\r\nhave said sooth; but you should bethink you how much more heat girls have\r\nin them than ladies that are advanced in years.\" \"True, my daughter,\"\r\nreturned the lady, \"but I cannot order that it shall be hot and cold, as\r\nthou perchance wouldst like; we must take the weather as we find it, and\r\nas the seasons provide it: perchance to-night it will be cooler, and thou\r\nwilt sleep better.\" \"God grant it be so,\" said Caterina, \"but 'tis not\r\nwonted for the nights to grow cooler as the summer comes on.\" \"What\r\nthen,\" said the lady, \"wouldst thou have me do?\" \"With your leave and my\r\nfather's,\" answered Caterina, \"I should like to have a little bed made up\r\non the terrace by his room and over his garden, where, hearing the\r\nnightingales sing, and being in a much cooler place, I should sleep much\r\nbetter than in your room.\" Whereupon:--\"Daughter, be of good cheer,\" said\r\nthe mother; \"I will speak to thy father, and we will do as he shall\r\ndecide.\" So the lady told Messer Lizio what had passed between her and\r\nthe damsel; but he, being old and perhaps for that reason a little\r\nmorose, said:--\"What nightingale is this, to whose chant she would fain\r\nsleep? I will see to it that the cicalas shall yet lull her to sleep.\"\r\nWhich speech, coming to Caterina's ears, gave her such offence, that for\r\nanger, rather than by reason of the heat, she not only slept not herself\r\nthat night, but suffered not her mother to sleep, keeping up a perpetual\r\ncomplaint of the great heat. Wherefore her mother hied her in the morning\r\nto Messer Lizio, and said to him:--\"Sir, you hold your daughter none too\r\ndear; what difference can it make to you that she lie on the terrace? She\r\nhas tossed about all night long by reason of the heat; and besides, can\r\nyou wonder that she, girl that she is, loves to hear the nightingale\r\nsing? Young folk naturally affect their likes.\" Whereto Messer Lizio made\r\nanswer:--\"Go, make her a bed there to your liking, and set a curtain\r\nround it, and let her sleep there, and hear the nightingale sing to her\r\nheart's content.\" Which the damsel no sooner learned, than she had a bed\r\nmade there with intent to sleep there that same night; wherefore she\r\nwatched until she saw Ricciardo, whom by a concerted sign she gave to\r\nunderstand what he was to do. Messer Lizio, as soon as he had heard the\r\ndamsel go to bed, locked a door that led from his room to the terrace,\r\nand went to sleep himself. When all was quiet, Ricciardo with the help of\r\na ladder got upon a wall, and standing thereon laid hold of certain\r\ntoothings of another wall, and not without great exertion and risk, had\r\nhe fallen, clambered up on to the terrace, where the damsel received him\r\nquietly with the heartiest of cheer. Many a kiss they exchanged; and then\r\ngot them to bed, where well-nigh all night long they had solace and\r\njoyance of one another, and made the nightingale sing not a few times.\r\nBut, brief being the night and great their pleasure, towards dawn, albeit\r\nthey wist it not, they fell asleep, Caterina's right arm encircling\r\nRicciardo's neck, while with her left hand she held him by that part of\r\nhis person which your modesty, my ladies, is most averse to name in the\r\ncompany of men. So, peacefully they slept, and were still asleep when day\r\nbroke and Messer Lizio rose; and calling to mind that his daughter slept\r\non the terrace, softly opened the door, saying to himself:--Let me see\r\nwhat sort of night's rest the nightingale has afforded our Caterina? And\r\nhaving entered, he gently raised the curtain that screened the bed, and\r\nsaw Ricciardo asleep with her and in her embrace as described, both being\r\nquite naked and uncovered; and having taken note of Ricciardo, he went\r\naway, and hied him to his lady's room, and called her, saying:--\"Up, up,\r\nwife, come and see; for thy daughter has fancied the nightingale to such\r\npurpose that she has caught him, and holds him in her hand.\" \"How can\r\nthis be?\" said the lady. \"Come quickly, and thou shalt see,\" replied\r\nMesser Lizio. So the lady huddled on her clothes, and silently followed\r\nMesser Lizio, and when they were come to the bed, and had raised the\r\ncurtain, Madonna Giacomina saw plainly enough how her daughter had\r\ncaught, and did hold the nightingale, whose song she had so longed to\r\nhear. Whereat the lady, deeming that Ricciardo had played her a cruel\r\ntrick, would have cried out and upbraided him; but Messer Lizio said to\r\nher:--\"Wife, as thou valuest my love, say not a word; for in good sooth,\r\nseeing that she has caught him, he shall be hers. Ricciardo is a\r\ngentleman and wealthy; an alliance with him cannot but be to our\r\nadvantage: if he would part from me on good terms, he must first marry\r\nher, so that the nightingale shall prove to have been put in his own cage\r\nand not in that of another.\" Whereby the lady was reassured, seeing that\r\nher husband took the affair so quietly, and that her daughter had had a\r\ngood night, and was rested, and had caught the nightingale. So she kept\r\nsilence; nor had they long to wait before Ricciardo awoke; and, seeing\r\nthat 'twas broad day, deemed that 'twas as much as his life was worth,\r\nand aroused Caterina, saying:--\"Alas! my soul, what shall we do, now that\r\nday has come and surprised me here?\" Which question Messer Lizio answered\r\nby coming forward, and saying:--\"We shall do well.\" At sight of him\r\nRicciardo felt as if his heart were torn out of his body, and sate up in\r\nthe bed, and said:--\"My lord, I cry you mercy for God's sake. I wot that\r\nmy disloyalty and delinquency have merited death; wherefore deal with me\r\neven as it may seem best to you: however, I pray you, if so it may be, to\r\nspare my life, that I die not.\" \"Ricciardo,\" replied Messer Lizio, \"the\r\nlove I bore thee, and the faith I reposed in thee, merited a better\r\nreturn; but still, as so it is, and youth has seduced thee into such a\r\ntransgression, redeem thy life, and preserve my honour, by making\r\nCaterina thy lawful spouse, that thine, as she has been for this past\r\nnight, she may remain for the rest of her life. In this way thou mayst\r\nsecure my peace and thy safety; otherwise commend thy soul to God.\"\r\nPending this colloquy, Caterina let go the nightingale, and having\r\ncovered herself, began with many a tear to implore her father to forgive\r\nRicciardo, and Ricciardo to do as Messer Lizio required, that thereby\r\nthey might securely count upon a long continuance of such nights of\r\ndelight. But there needed not much supplication; for, what with remorse\r\nfor the wrong done, and the wish to make amends, and the fear of death,\r\nand the desire to escape it, and above all ardent love, and the craving\r\nto possess the beloved one, Ricciardo lost no time in making frank avowal\r\nof his readiness to do as Messer Lizio would have him. Wherefore Messer\r\nLizio, having borrowed a ring from Madonna Giacomina, Ricciardo did there\r\nand then in their presence wed Caterina. Which done, Messer Lizio and the\r\nlady took their leave, saying:--\"Now rest ye a while; for so perchance\r\n'twere better for you than if ye rose.\" And so they left the young folks,\r\nwho forthwith embraced, and not having travelled more than six miles\r\nduring the night, went two miles further before they rose, and so\r\nconcluded their first day. When they were risen, Ricciardo and Messer\r\nLizio discussed the matter with more formality; and some days afterwards\r\nRicciardo, as was meet, married the damsel anew in presence of their\r\nfriends and kinsfolk, and brought her home with great pomp, and\r\ncelebrated his nuptials with due dignity and splendour. And so for many a\r\nyear thereafter he lived with her in peace and happiness, and snared the\r\nnightingales day and night to his heart's content.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL V.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGuidotto da Cremona dies leaving a girl to Giacomino da Pavia. She has\r\ntwo lovers in Faenza, to wit, Giannole di Severino and Minghino di\r\nMingole, who fight about her. She is discovered to be Giannole's sister,\r\nand is given to Minghino to wife.\r\n--\r\n\r\nAll the ladies laughed so heartily over the story of the nightingale,\r\nthat, even when Filostrato had finished, they could not control their\r\nmerriment. However, when the laughter was somewhat abated, the queen\r\nsaid:--\"Verily if thou didst yesterday afflict us, to-day thou hast\r\ntickled us to such purpose that none of us may justly complain of thee.\"\r\nThen, as the turn had now come round to Neifile, she bade her give them a\r\nstory. And thus, blithely, Neifile began:--As Filostrato went to Romagna\r\nfor the matter of his discourse, I too am fain to make a short journey\r\nthrough the same country in what I am about to relate to you.\r\n\r\nI say, then, that there dwelt of yore in the city of Fano two Lombards,\r\nthe one ycleped Guidotto da Cremona and the other Giacomino da Pavia, men\r\nadvanced in life, who, being soldiers, had spent the best part of their\r\nyouth in feats of arms. Now Guidotto, being at the point of death, and\r\nhaving no son or any friend or kinsman in whom he placed more trust than\r\nin Giacomino, left him a girl of about ten years, and all that he had in\r\nthe world, and so, having given him to know not a little of his affairs,\r\nhe died. About the same time the city of Faenza, which had long been at\r\nwar and in a most sorry plight, began to recover some measure of\r\nprosperity; and thereupon liberty to return thither on honourable terms\r\nwas accorded to all that were so minded. Whither, accordingly, Giacomino,\r\nwho had dwelt there aforetime, and liked the place, returned with all his\r\ngoods and chattels, taking with him the girl left him by Guidotto, whom\r\nhe loved and entreated as his daughter. The girl grew up as beautiful a\r\nmaiden as was to be found in the city; and no less debonair and modest\r\nwas she than fair. Wherefore she lacked not admirers; but above all two\r\nyoung men, both very gallant and of equal merit, the one Giannole di\r\nSeverino, the other Minghino di Mingole, affected her with so ardent a\r\npassion, that, growing jealous, they came to hate one another with an\r\ninordinate hatred. Right gladly would each have espoused her, she being\r\nnow fifteen years old, but that his kinsmen forbade it; wherefore seeing\r\nthat neither might have her in an honourable way, each determined to\r\ncompass his end as best he might.\r\n\r\nNow Giacomino had in his house an ancient maid, and a man, by name\r\nCrivello, a very pleasant and friendly sort of fellow, with whom Giannole\r\ngrew familiar, and in due time confided to him all his love, praying him\r\nto further the attainment of his desire, and promising to reward him\r\nhandsomely, if he did so. Crivello made answer:--\"Thou must know that\r\nthere is but one way in which I might be of service to thee in this\r\naffair: I might contrive that thou shouldst be where she is when\r\nGiacomino is gone off to supper; but, were I to presume to say aught to\r\nher on thy behalf, she would never listen to me. This, if it please thee,\r\nI promise to do for thee, and will be as good as my word; and then thou\r\ncanst do whatever thou mayst deem most expedient.\" Giannole said that he\r\nasked no more; and so 'twas arranged.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Minghino on his part had made friends with the maid, on whom he\r\nhad so wrought that she had carried several messages to the girl, and had\r\ngone far to kindle her to his love, and furthermore had promised to\r\ncontrive that he should meet her when for any cause Giacomino should be\r\nfrom home in the evening. And so it befell that no long time after these\r\nparleys, Giacomino, by Crivello's management, was to go sup at the house\r\nof a friend, and by preconcert between Crivello and Giannole, upon signal\r\ngiven, Giannole was to come to Giacomino's house and find the door open.\r\nThe maid, on her part, witting nought of the understanding between\r\nCrivello and Giannole, let Minghino know that Giacomino would not sup at\r\nhome, and bade him be near the house, so that he might come and enter it\r\non sight of a signal from her. The evening came; neither of the lovers\r\nknew aught of what the other was about; but, being suspicious of one\r\nanother, they came to take possession, each with his own company of armed\r\nfriends. Minghino, while awaiting the signal, rested with his company in\r\nthe house of one of his friends hard by the girl's house: Giannole with\r\nhis company was posted a little farther off. Crivello and the maid, when\r\nGiacomino was gone, did each their endeavour to get the other out of the\r\nway. Crivello said to the maid:--\"How is it thou takest not thyself off\r\nto bed, but goest still hither and thither about the house?\" And the maid\r\nsaid to Crivello:--\"Nay, but why goest thou not after thy master? Thou\r\nhast supped; what awaitest thou here?\" And so, neither being able to make\r\nthe other quit the post, Crivello, the hour concerted with Giannole being\r\ncome, said to himself:--What care I for her? If she will not keep quiet,\r\n'tis like to be the worse for her. Whereupon he gave the signal, and hied\r\nhim to the door, which he had no sooner opened, than Giannole entered\r\nwith two of his companions, and finding the girl in the saloon, laid\r\nhands on her with intent to carry her off. The girl struggled, and\r\nshrieked amain, as did also the maid. Minghino, fearing the noise, hasted\r\nto the spot with his companions; and, seeing that the girl was already\r\nbeing borne across the threshold, they drew their swords, and cried out\r\nin chorus:--\"Ah! Traitors that ye are, ye are all dead men! 'Twill go\r\notherwise than ye think for. What means this force?\" Which said, they\r\nfell upon them with their swords, while the neighbours, alarmed by the\r\nnoise, came hurrying forth with lights and arms, and protested that 'twas\r\nan outrage, and took Minghino's part. So, after a prolonged struggle,\r\nMinghino wrested the girl from Giannole, and set her again in Giacomino's\r\nhouse. Nor were the combatants separated before the officers of the\r\nGovernor of the city came up and arrested not a few of them; among them\r\nMinghino and Giannole and Crivello, whom they marched off to prison.\r\nHowever, peace being restored and Giacomino returned, 'twas with no\r\nlittle chagrin that he heard of the affair; but finding upon\r\ninvestigation that the girl was in no wise culpable, he was somewhat\r\nreassured; and determined, lest the like should again happen, to bestow\r\nthe girl in marriage as soon as might be.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow the kinsfolk of the two lovers, having learned the truth of\r\nthe matter, and knowing what evil might ensue to the captives, if\r\nGiacomino should be minded to take the course which he reasonably might,\r\ncame and gave him good words, beseeching him to let the kindly feeling,\r\nthe love, which they believed he bore to them, his suppliants, count for\r\nmore with him than the wrong that the hare-brained gallants had done him,\r\nand on their part and their own offering to make any amend that he might\r\nrequire. Giacomino, who had seen many things in his time, and lacked not\r\nsound sense, made answer briefly:--\"Gentlemen, were I in my own country,\r\nas I am in yours, I hold myself in such sort your friend that nought\r\nwould I do in this matter, or in any other, save what might be agreeable\r\nto you: besides which, I have the more reason to consider your wishes,\r\nbecause 'tis against you yourselves that you have offended, inasmuch as\r\nthis damsel, whatever many folk may suppose, is neither of Cremona nor of\r\nPavia, but is of Faenza, albeit neither I nor she, nor he from whom I had\r\nher, did ever wot whose daughter she was: wherefore, touching that you\r\nask of me, I will even do just as you bid me.\" The worthy men found it\r\npassing strange that the girl should be of Faenza; and having thanked\r\nGiacomino for his handsome answer, they besought him that he would be\r\npleased to tell them how she had come into his hands, and how he knew\r\nthat she was of Faenza. To whom Giacomino replied on this wise:--\"A\r\ncomrade and friend I had, Guidotto da Cremona, who, being at the point of\r\ndeath, told me that, when this city of Faenza was taken by the Emperor\r\nFrederic, he and his comrades, entering one of the houses during the\r\nsack, found there good store of booty, and never a soul save this girl,\r\nwho, being two years old or thereabouts, greeted him as father as he came\r\nup the stairs; wherefore he took pity on her, and carried her with\r\nwhatever else was in the house away with him to Fano; where on his\r\ndeathbed he left her to me, charging me in due time to bestow her in\r\nmarriage, and give her all his goods and chattels by way of dowry: but,\r\nalbeit she is now of marriageable age, I have not been able to provide\r\nher with a husband to my mind; though right glad should I be to do so,\r\nthat nought like the event of yesterday may again befall me.\"\r\n\r\nNow among the rest of those present was one Guglielmo da Medicina, who\r\nhad been with Guidotto on that occasion, and knew well whose house it was\r\nthat Guidotto had sacked; and seeing the owner there among the rest, he\r\nwent up to him, and said:--\"Dost hear, Bernabuccio, what Giacomino says?\"\r\n\"Ay,\" answered Bernabuccio, \"and I gave the more heed thereto, for that I\r\ncall to mind that during those disorders I lost a little daughter of just\r\nthe age that Giacomino speaks of.\" \"'Tis verily she then,\" said\r\nGuglielmo, \"for once when I was with Guidotto I heard him describe what\r\nhouse it was that he had sacked, and I wist that 'twas thine. Wherefore\r\nsearch thy memory if there be any sign by which thou thinkest to\r\nrecognize her, and let her be examined that thou mayst be assured that\r\nshe is thy daughter.\" So Bernabuccio pondered a while, and then\r\nrecollected that she ought to have a scar, shewing like a tiny cross,\r\nabove her left ear, being where he had excised a tumour a little while\r\nbefore that affair: wherefore without delay he went up to Giacomino, who\r\nwas still there, and besought him to let him go home with him and see the\r\ndamsel. Giacomino gladly did so, and no sooner was the girl brought into\r\nBernabuccio's presence, than, as he beheld her, 'twas as if he saw the\r\nface of her mother, who was still a beautiful woman. However, he would\r\nnot rest there, but besought Giacomino of his grace to permit him to lift\r\na lock or two of hair above her left ear; whereto Giacomino consented. So\r\nBernabuccio approached her where she stood somewhat shamefast, and with\r\nhis right hand lifted her locks, and, seeing the cross, wist that in very\r\ntruth she was his daughter, and tenderly wept and embraced her, albeit\r\nshe withstood him; and then, turning to Giacomino, he said:--\"My brother,\r\nthe girl is my daughter; 'twas my house that Guidotto sacked, and so\r\nsudden was the assault that my wife, her mother, forgot her, and we have\r\nalways hitherto supposed, that, my house being burned that same day, she\r\nperished in the flames.\" Catching his words, and seeing that he was\r\nadvanced in years, the girl inclined to believe him, and impelled by some\r\noccult instinct, suffered his embraces, and melting, mingled her tears\r\nwith his. Bernabuccio forthwith sent for her mother and her sisters and\r\nother kinswomen and her brothers, and having shewn her to them all, and\r\ntold the story, after they had done her great cheer and embraced her a\r\nthousand times, to Giacomino's no small delight, he brought her home with\r\nhim. Which coming to the ears of the Governor of the city, the worthy\r\nman, knowing that Giannole, whom he had in ward, was Bernabuccio's son\r\nand the girl's brother, made up his mind to deal leniently with Giannole:\r\nwherefore he took upon himself the part of mediator in the affair, and\r\nhaving made peace between Bernabuccio and Giacomino and Giannole and\r\nMinghino, gave Agnesa--such was the damsel's name--to Minghino to wife,\r\nto the great delight of all Minghino's kinsfolk, and set at liberty not\r\nonly Giannole and Minghino but Crivello, and the others their\r\nconfederates in the affair. Whereupon Minghino with the blithest of\r\nhearts wedded Agnesa with all due pomp and circumstance, and brought her\r\nhome, where for many a year thereafter he lived with her in peace and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VI.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGianni di Procida, being found with a damsel that he loves, and who had\r\nbeen given to King Frederic, is bound with her to a stake, so to be\r\nburned. He is recognized by Ruggieri dell' Oria, is delivered, and\r\nmarries her.\r\n--\r\n\r\nNeifile's story, with which the ladies were greatly delighted, being\r\nended, the queen called for one from Pampinea; who forthwith raised her\r\nnoble countenance, and thus began:--Mighty indeed, gracious ladies, are\r\nthe forces of Love, and great are the labours and excessive and unthought\r\nof the perils which they induce lovers to brave; as is manifest enough by\r\nwhat we have heard to-day and on other occasions: howbeit I mean to shew\r\nyou the same once more by a story of an enamoured youth.\r\n\r\nHard by Naples is the island of Ischia, in which there dwelt aforetime\r\nwith other young damsels one, Restituta by name, daughter of one Marin\r\nBolgaro, a gentleman of the island. Very fair was she, and blithe of\r\nheart, and by a young gallant, Gianni by name, of the neighbouring islet\r\nof Procida, was beloved more dearly than life, and in like measure\r\nreturned his love. Now, not to mention his daily resort to Ischia to see\r\nher, there were times not a few when Gianni, not being able to come by a\r\nboat, would swim across from Procida by night, that he might have sight,\r\nif of nought else, at least of the walls of her house. And while their\r\nlove burned thus fervently, it so befell that one summer's day, as the\r\ndamsel was all alone on the seashore, picking her way from rock to rock,\r\ndetaching, as she went, shells from their beds with a knife, she came to\r\na recess among the rocks, where for the sake, as well of the shade as of\r\nthe comfort afforded by a spring of most cool water that was there, some\r\nSicilian gallants, that were come from Naples, had put in with their\r\nfelucca. Who, having taken note of the damsel, that she was very fair,\r\nand that she was not yet ware of them, and was alone, resolved to capture\r\nher, and carry her away; nor did they fail to give effect to their\r\nresolve; but, albeit she shrieked amain, they laid hands on her, and set\r\nher aboard their boat, and put to sea. Arrived at Calabria, they fell a\r\nwrangling as to whose the damsel should be, and in brief each claimed her\r\nfor his own: wherefore, finding no means of coming to an agreement, and\r\nfearing that worse might befall them, and she bring misfortune upon them,\r\nthey resolved with one accord to give her to Frederic, King of Sicily,\r\nwho was then a young man, and took no small delight in commodities of\r\nthat quality; and so, being come to Palermo, they did.\r\n\r\nMarking her beauty, the King set great store by her; but as she was\r\nsomewhat indisposed, he commanded that, till she was stronger, she should\r\nbe lodged and tended in a very pretty villa that was in one of his\r\ngardens, which he called Cuba; and so 'twas done. The purloining of the\r\ndamsel caused no small stir in Ischia, more especially because 'twas\r\nimpossible to discover by whom she had been carried off. But Gianni, more\r\nconcerned than any other, despairing of finding her in Ischia, and being\r\napprised of the course the felucca had taken, equipped one himself, and\r\nput to sea, and in hot haste scoured the whole coast from Minerva to\r\nScalea in Calabria, making everywhere diligent search for the damsel, and\r\nin Scalea learned that she had been taken by Sicilian mariners to\r\nPalermo. Whither, accordingly, he hied him with all speed; and there\r\nafter long search discovering that she had been given to the King, who\r\nkept her at Cuba, he was sore troubled, insomuch that he now scarce\r\nventured to hope that he should ever set eyes on her, not to speak of\r\nhaving her for his own, again. But still, holden by Love, and seeing that\r\nnone there knew him, he sent the felucca away, and tarried there, and\r\nfrequently passing by Cuba, he chanced one day to catch sight of her at a\r\nwindow, and was seen of her, to their great mutual satisfaction. And\r\nGianni, taking note that the place was lonely, made up to her, and had\r\nsuch speech of her as he might, and being taught by her after what\r\nfashion he must proceed, if he would have further speech of her, he\r\ndeparted, but not till he had made himself thoroughly acquainted with the\r\nconfiguration of the place; and having waited until night was come and\r\nindeed far spent, he returned thither, and though the ascent was such\r\nthat 'twould scarce have afforded lodgment to a woodpecker, won his way\r\nup and entered the garden, where, finding a pole, he set it against the\r\nwindow which the damsel had pointed out as hers, and thereby swarmed up\r\neasily enough.\r\n\r\nThe damsel had aforetime shewn herself somewhat distant towards him,\r\nbeing careful of her honour, but now deeming it already lost, she had\r\nbethought her that there was none to whom she might more worthily give\r\nherself than to him; and reckoning upon inducing him to carry her off,\r\nshe had made up her mind to gratify his every desire; and to that end had\r\nleft the window open that his ingress might be unimpeded. So, finding it\r\nopen, Gianni softly entered, lay down beside the damsel, who was awake,\r\nand before they went further, opened to him all her mind, beseeching him\r\nmost earnestly to take her thence, and carry her off. Gianni replied that\r\nthere was nought that would give him so much pleasure, and that without\r\nfail, upon leaving her, he would make all needful arrangements for\r\nbringing her away when he next came. Whereupon with exceeding great\r\ndelight they embraced one another, and plucked that boon than which Love\r\nhas no greater to bestow; and having so done divers times, they\r\nunwittingly fell asleep in one another's arms.\r\n\r\nNow towards daybreak the King, who had been greatly charmed with the\r\ndamsel at first sight, happened to call her to mind, and feeling himself\r\nfit, resolved, notwithstanding the hour, to go lie with her a while; and\r\nso, attended by a few of his servants, he hied him privily to Cuba.\r\nHaving entered the house, he passed (the door being softly opened) into\r\nthe room in which he knew the damsel slept. A great blazing torch was\r\nborne before him, and so, as he bent his glance on the bed, he espied the\r\ndamsel and Gianni lying asleep, naked and in one another's arms. Whereat\r\nhe was seized with a sudden and vehement passion of wrath, insomuch that,\r\nalbeit he said never a word, he could scarce refrain from slaying both of\r\nthem there and then with a dagger that he had with him. Then, bethinking\r\nhim that 'twere the depth of baseness in any man--not to say a king--to\r\nslay two naked sleepers, he mastered himself, and determined to do them\r\nto death in public and by fire. Wherefore, turning to a single companion\r\nthat he had with him, he said:--\"What thinkest thou of this base woman,\r\nin whom I had placed my hope?\" And then he asked whether he knew the\r\ngallant, that had presumed to enter his house to do him such outrage and\r\ndespite. Whereto the other replied that he minded not ever to have seen\r\nhim. Thereupon the King hied him out of the room in a rage, and bade take\r\nthe two lovers, naked as they were, and bind them, and, as soon as 'twas\r\nbroad day, bring them to Palermo, and bind them back to back to a stake\r\nin the piazza, there to remain until tierce, that all might see them,\r\nafter which they were to be burned, as they had deserved. And having so\r\nordered, he went back to Palermo, and shut himself up in his room, very\r\nwroth.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was he gone than there came unto the two lovers folk not a few,\r\nwho, having awakened them, did forthwith ruthlessly take and bind them:\r\nwhereat, how they did grieve and tremble for their lives, and weep and\r\nbitterly bewail their fate, may readily be understood.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the King's commandment they were brought to Palermo, and\r\nbound to a stake in the piazza; and before their eyes faggots and fire\r\nwere made ready to burn them at the hour appointed by the King. Great was\r\nthe concourse of the folk of Palermo, both men and women, that came to\r\nsee the two lovers, the men all agog to feast their eyes on the damsel,\r\nwhom they lauded for shapeliness and loveliness, and no less did the\r\nwomen commend the gallant, whom in like manner they crowded to see, for\r\nthe same qualities. Meanwhile the two hapless lovers, both exceeding\r\nshamefast, stood with bent heads bitterly bewailing their evil fortune,\r\nand momently expecting their death by the cruel fire. So they awaited the\r\ntime appointed by the King; but their offence being bruited abroad, the\r\ntidings reached the ears of Ruggieri dell' Oria, a man of peerless worth,\r\nand at that time the King's admiral, who, being likewise minded to see\r\nthem, came to the place where they were bound, and after gazing on the\r\ndamsel and finding her very fair, turned to look at the gallant, whom\r\nwith little trouble he recognized, and drawing nearer to him, he asked\r\nhim if he were Gianni di Procida. Gianni raised his head, and recognizing\r\nthe admiral, made answer:--\"My lord, he, of whom you speak, I was; but I\r\nam now as good as no more.\" The admiral then asked him what it was that\r\nhad brought him to such a pass. Whereupon:--\"Love and the King's wrath,\"\r\nquoth Gianni. The admiral induced him to be more explicit, and having\r\nlearned from him exactly how it had come about, was turning away, when\r\nGianni called him back, saying:--\"Oh! my lord, if so it may be, procure\r\nme one favour of him by whose behest I thus stand here.\" \"What favour?\"\r\ndemanded Ruggieri. \"I see,\" returned Gianni, \"that die I must, and that\r\nright soon. I crave, then, as a favour, that, whereas this damsel and I,\r\nthat have loved one another more dearly than life, are here set back to\r\nback, we may be set face to face, that I may have the consolation of\r\ngazing on her face as I depart.\" Ruggieri laughed as he replied:--\"With\r\nall my heart. I will so order it that thou shalt see enough of her to\r\ntire of her.\" He then left him and charged the executioners to do nothing\r\nmore without further order of the King; and being assured of their\r\nobedience, he hied him forthwith to the King, to whom, albeit he found\r\nhim in a wrathful mood, he spared not to speak his mind, saying:--\"Sire,\r\nwherein have they wronged thee, those two young folk, whom thou hast\r\nordered to be burned down there in the piazza?\" The King told him.\r\nWhereupon Ruggieri continued:--\"Their offence does indeed merit such\r\npunishment, but not at thy hands, and if misdeeds should not go\r\nunpunished, services should not go unrewarded; nay, may warrant\r\nindulgence and mercy. Knowest thou who they are whom thou wouldst have\r\nburned?\" The King signified that he did not. Whereupon Ruggieri:--\"But\r\nI,\" quoth he, \"am minded that thou shouldst know them, to the end that\r\nthou mayst know with what discretion thou surrenderest thyself to a\r\ntransport of rage. The young man is the son of Landolfo di Procida,\r\nbrother of Messer Gianni di Procida, to whom thou owest it that thou art\r\nlord and king of this island. The damsel is a daughter of Marin Bolgaro,\r\nwhose might alone to-day prevents Ischia from throwing off thy yoke.\r\nMoreover, these young folk have long been lovers, and 'tis for that the\r\nmight of Love constrained them, and not that they would do despite to thy\r\nlordship, that they have committed this offence, if indeed 'tis meet to\r\ncall that an offence which young folk do for Love's sake. Wherefore,\r\nthen, wouldst thou do them to death, when thou shouldst rather do them\r\nall cheer, and honour them with lordly gifts?\" The King gave ear to\r\nRuggieri's words, and being satisfied that he spoke sooth, repented him,\r\nnot only of his evil purpose, but of what he had already done, and\r\nforthwith gave order to loose the two young folk from the stake, and\r\nbring them before him; and so 'twas done. And having fully apprised\r\nhimself of their case, he saw fit to make them amends of the wrong he had\r\ndone them with honours and largess. Wherefore he caused them to be\r\nsplendidly arrayed, and being assured that they were both minded to wed,\r\nhe himself gave Gianni his bride, and loading them with rich presents,\r\nsent them well content back to Ischia, where they were welcomed with all\r\nfestal cheer, and lived long time thereafter to their mutual solace and\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nTeodoro, being enamoured of Violante, daughter of Messer Amerigo, his\r\nlord, gets her with child, and is sentenced to the gallows; but while he\r\nis being scourged thither, he is recognized by his father, and being set\r\nat large, takes Violante to wife.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhile they doubted whether the two lovers would be burned, the ladies\r\nwere all fear and suspense; but when they heard of their deliverance,\r\nthey all with one accord put on a cheerful countenance, praising God. The\r\nstory ended, the queen ordained that the next should be told by Lauretta,\r\nwho blithely thus began:--\r\n\r\nFairest ladies, what time good King Guglielmo ruled Sicily there dwelt on\r\nthe island a gentleman, Messer Amerigo Abate da Trapani by name, who was\r\nwell provided, as with other temporal goods, so also with children. For\r\nwhich cause being in need of servants, he took occasion of the appearance\r\nin Trapani waters of certain Genoese corsairs from the Levant, who,\r\nscouring the coast of Armenia, had captured not a few boys, to purchase\r\nof them some of these youngsters, supposing them to be Turks; among whom,\r\nalbeit most shewed as mere shepherd boys, there was one, Teodoro, by\r\nname, whose less rustic mien seemed to betoken gentle blood. Who, though\r\nstill treated as a slave, was suffered to grow up in the house with\r\nMesser Amerigo's children, and, nature getting the better of\r\ncircumstance, bore himself with such grace and dignity that Messer\r\nAmerigo gladly gave him his freedom, and still deeming him to be a Turk,\r\nhad him baptized and named Pietro, and made him his majordomo, and placed\r\nmuch trust in him. Now among the other children that grew up in Messer\r\nAmerigo's house was his fair and dainty daughter, Violante; and, as her\r\nfather was in no hurry to give her in marriage, it so befell that she\r\nbecame enamoured of Pietro, but, for all her love and the great conceit\r\nshe had of his qualities and conduct, she nevertheless was too shamefast\r\nto discover her passion to him. However, Love spared her the pains, for\r\nPietro had cast many a furtive glance in her direction, and had grown so\r\nenamoured of her that 'twas never well with him except he saw her; but\r\ngreat was his fear lest any should detect his passion, for he deemed\r\n'twould be the worse for him. The damsel, who was fain indeed of the\r\nsight of him, understood his case; and to encourage him dissembled not\r\nher exceeding great satisfaction. On which footing they remained a great\r\nwhile, neither venturing to say aught to the other, much as both longed\r\nto do so. But, while they both burned with a mutual flame, Fortune, as if\r\ntheir entanglement were of her preordaining, found means to banish the\r\nfear and hesitation that kept them tongue-tied.\r\n\r\nMesser Amerigo possessed, a mile or so from Trapani, a goodly estate, to\r\nwhich he was wont not seldom to resort with his daughter and other ladies\r\nby way of recreation; and on one of these days, while there they tarried\r\nwith Pietro, whom they had brought with them, suddenly, as will sometimes\r\nhappen in summer, the sky became overcast with black clouds, insomuch\r\nthat the lady and her companions, lest the storm should surprise them\r\nthere, set out on their return to Trapani, making all the haste they\r\nmight. But Pietro and the girl being young, and sped perchance by Love no\r\nless than by fear of the storm, completely outstripped her mother and the\r\nother ladies; and when they were gotten so far ahead as to be well-nigh\r\nout of sight of the lady and all the rest, the thunder burst upon them\r\npeal upon peal, hard upon which came a fall of hail very thick and close,\r\nfrom which the lady sought shelter in the house of a husbandman. Pietro\r\nand the damsel, finding no more convenient refuge, betook them to an old,\r\nand all but ruinous, and now deserted, cottage, which, however, still had\r\na bit of roof left, whereunder they both took their stand in such close\r\nquarters, owing to the exiguity of the shelter, that they perforce\r\ntouched one another. Which contact was the occasion that they gathered\r\nsomewhat more courage to disclose their love; and so it was that Pietro\r\nbegan on this wise:--\"Now would to God that this hail might never cease,\r\nthat so I might stay here for ever!\" \"And well content were I,\" returned\r\nthe damsel. And by and by their hands met, not without a tender pressure,\r\nand then they fell to embracing and so to kissing one another, while the\r\nhail continued. And not to dwell on every detail, the sky was not clear\r\nbefore they had known the last degree of love's felicity, and had taken\r\nthought how they might secretly enjoy one another in the future. The\r\ncottage being close to the city gate, they hied them thither, as soon as\r\nthe storm was overpast, and having there awaited the lady, returned home\r\nwith her. Nor, using all discretion, did they fail thereafter to meet\r\nfrom time to time in secret, to their no small solace; and the affair\r\nwent so far that the damsel conceived, whereby they were both not a\r\nlittle disconcerted; insomuch that the damsel employed many artifices to\r\narrest the course of nature, but to no effect. Wherefore Pietro, being in\r\nfear of his life, saw nothing for it but flight, and told her so.\r\nWhereupon:--\"If thou leave me,\" quoth she, \"I shall certainly kill\r\nmyself.\" Much as he loved her, Pietro answered:--\"Nay but, my lady,\r\nwherefore wouldst thou have me tarry here? Thy pregnancy will discover\r\nour offence: thou wilt be readily forgiven; but 'twill be my woeful lot\r\nto bear the penalty of thy sin and mine.\" \"Pietro,\" returned the damsel,\r\n\"too well will they wot of my offence, but be sure that, if thou confess\r\nnot, none will ever wot of thine.\" Then quoth he:--\"Since thou givest me\r\nthis promise, I will stay; but mind thou keep it.\"\r\n\r\nThe damsel, who had done her best to keep her condition secret, saw at\r\nlength by the increase of her bulk that 'twas impossible: wherefore one\r\nday most piteously bewailing herself, she made her avowal to her mother,\r\nand besought her to shield her from the consequences. Distressed beyond\r\nmeasure, the lady chid her severely, and then asked her how it had come\r\nto pass. The damsel, to screen Pietro, invented a story by which she put\r\nanother complexion on the affair. The lady believed her, and, that her\r\nfall might not be discovered, took her off to one of their estates;\r\nwhere, the time of her delivery being come, and she, as women do in such\r\na case, crying out for pain, it so befell that Messer Amerigo, whom the\r\nlady expected not, as indeed he was scarce ever wont, to come there, did\r\nso, having been out a hawking, and passing by the chamber where the\r\ndamsel lay, marvelled to hear her cries, and forthwith entered, and asked\r\nwhat it meant. On sight of whom the lady rose and sorrowfully gave him\r\nher daughter's version of what had befallen her. But he, less credulous\r\nthan his wife, averred that it could not be true that she knew not by\r\nwhom she was pregnant, and was minded to know the whole truth: let the\r\ndamsel confess and she might regain his favour; otherwise she must expect\r\nno mercy and prepare for death.\r\n\r\nThe lady did all she could to induce her husband to rest satisfied with\r\nwhat she had told him; but all to no purpose. Mad with rage, he rushed,\r\ndrawn sword in hand, to his daughter's bedside (she, pending the parley,\r\nhaving given birth to a boy) and cried out:--\"Declare whose this infant\r\nis, or forthwith thou diest.\" Overcome by fear of death, the damsel broke\r\nher promise to Pietro, and made a clean breast of all that had passed\r\nbetween him and her. Whereat the knight, grown fell with rage, could\r\nscarce refrain from slaying her. However, having given vent to his wrath\r\nin such words as it dictated, he remounted his horse and rode to Trapani,\r\nand there before one Messer Currado, the King's lieutenant, laid\r\ninformation of the wrong done him by Pietro, in consequence whereof\r\nPietro, who suspected nothing, was forthwith taken, and being put to the\r\ntorture, confessed all. Some days later the lieutenant sentenced him to\r\nbe scourged through the city, and then hanged by the neck; and Messer\r\nAmerigo, being minded that one and the same hour should rid the earth of\r\nthe two lovers and their son (for to have compassed Pietro's death was\r\nnot enough to appease his wrath), mingled poison and wine in a goblet,\r\nand gave it to one of his servants with a drawn sword, saying:--\"Get thee\r\nwith this gear to Violante, and tell her from me to make instant choice\r\nof one of these two deaths, either the poison or the steel; else, I will\r\nhave her burned, as she deserves, in view of all the citizens; which\r\ndone, thou wilt take the boy that she bore a few days ago, and beat his\r\nbrains out against the wall, and cast his body for a prey to the dogs.\"\r\n\r\nHearing the remorseless doom thus passed by the angry father upon both\r\nhis daughter and his grandson, the servant, prompt to do evil rather than\r\ngood, hied him thence.\r\n\r\nNow, as Pietro in execution of his sentence was being scourged to the\r\ngallows by the serjeants, 'twas so ordered by the leaders of the band\r\nthat he passed by an inn, where were three noblemen of Armenia, sent by\r\nthe king of that country as ambassadors to Rome, to treat with the Pope\r\nof matters of the highest importance, touching a crusade that was to be;\r\nwho, having there alighted to rest and recreate them for some days, had\r\nreceived not a few tokens of honour from the nobles of Trapani, and most\r\nof all from Messer Amerigo. Hearing the tramp of Pietro's escort, they\r\ncame to a window to see what was toward; and one of them, an aged man,\r\nand of great authority, Fineo by name, looking hard at Pietro, who was\r\nstripped from the waist up, and had his hands bound behind his back,\r\nespied on his breast a great spot of scarlet, not laid on by art, but\r\nwrought in the skin by operation of Nature, being such as the ladies here\r\ncall a rose. Which he no sooner saw, than he was reminded of a son that\r\nhad been stolen from him by corsairs on the coast of Lazistan some\r\nfifteen years before, nor had he since been able to hear tidings of him;\r\nand guessing the age of the poor wretch that was being scourged, he set\r\nit down as about what his son's would be, were he living, and, what with\r\nthe mark and the age, he began to suspect that 'twas even his son, and\r\nbethought him that, if so, he would scarce as yet have forgotten his name\r\nor the speech of Armenia. Wherefore, as he was within earshot he called\r\nto him:--\"Teodoro!\" At the word Pietro raised his head: whereupon Fineo,\r\nspeaking in Armenian, asked him:--\"Whence and whose son art thou?\" The\r\nserjeants, that were leading him, paused in deference to the great man,\r\nand so Pietro answered:--\"Of Armenia was I, son of one Fineo, brought\r\nhither by folk I wot not of, when I was but a little child.\" Then Fineo,\r\nwitting that in very truth 'twas the boy that he had lost, came down with\r\nhis companions, weeping; and, all the serjeants making way, he ran to\r\nhim, and embraced him, and doffing a mantle of richest texture that he\r\nwore, he prayed the captain of the band to be pleased to tarry there\r\nuntil he should receive orders to go forward, and was answered by the\r\ncaptain that he would willingly so wait.\r\n\r\nFineo already knew, for 'twas bruited everywhere, the cause for which\r\nPietro was being led to the gallows; wherefore he straightway hied him\r\nwith his companions and their retinue to Messer Currado, and said to\r\nhim:--\"Sir, this lad, whom you are sending to the gallows like a slave,\r\nis freeborn, and my son, and is ready to take to wife her whom, as 'tis\r\nsaid, he has deflowered; so please you, therefore, delay the execution\r\nuntil such time as it may be understood whether she be minded to have him\r\nfor husband, lest, should she be so minded, you be found to have broken\r\nthe law.\" Messer Currado marvelled to hear that Pietro was Fineo's son,\r\nand not without shame, albeit 'twas not his but Fortune's fault,\r\nconfessed that 'twas even as Fineo said: and having caused Pietro to be\r\ntaken home with all speed, and Messer Amerigo to be brought before him,\r\ntold him the whole matter. Messer Amerigo, who supposed that by this time\r\nhis daughter and grandson must be dead, was the saddest man in the world\r\nto think that 'twas by his deed, witting that, were the damsel still\r\nalive, all might very easily be set right: however, he sent post haste to\r\nhis daughter's abode, revoking his orders, if they were not yet carried\r\nout. The servant, whom he had earlier despatched, had laid the sword and\r\npoison before the damsel, and, for that she was in no hurry to make her\r\nchoice, was giving her foul words, and endeavouring to constrain her\r\nthereto, when the messenger arrived; but on hearing the injunction laid\r\nupon him by his lord, he desisted, and went back, and told him how things\r\nstood. Whereupon Messer Amerigo, much relieved, hied him to Fineo, and\r\nwell-nigh weeping, and excusing himself for what had befallen, as best he\r\nknew how, craved his pardon, and professed himself well content to give\r\nTeodoro, so he were minded to have her, his daughter to wife. Fineo\r\nreadily accepted his excuses, and made answer:--\"'Tis my will that my son\r\nespouse your daughter, and, so he will not, let thy sentence passed upon\r\nhim be carried out.\"\r\n\r\nSo Fineo and Messer Amerigo being agreed, while Teodoro still languished\r\nin fear of death, albeit he was glad at heart to have found his father,\r\nthey questioned him of his will in regard of this matter.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard that, if he would, he might have Violante to wife,\r\nTeodoro's delight was such that he seemed to leap from hell to paradise,\r\nand said that, if 'twas agreeable to them all, he should deem it the\r\ngreatest of favours. So they sent to the damsel to learn her pleasure:\r\nwho, having heard how it had fared, and was now like to fare, with\r\nTeodoro, albeit, saddest of women, she looked for nought but death, began\r\nat length to give some credence to their words, and to recover heart a\r\nlittle, and answered that, were she to follow the bent of her desire,\r\nnought that could happen would delight her more than to be Teodoro's\r\nwife; but nevertheless she would do as her father bade her.\r\n\r\nSo, all agreeing, the damsel was espoused with all pomp and festal cheer,\r\nto the boundless delight of all the citizens, and was comforted, and\r\nnurtured her little boy, and in no long time waxed more beautiful than\r\never before; and, her confinement being ended, she presented herself\r\nbefore Fineo, who was then about to quit Rome on his homeward journey,\r\nand did him such reverence as is due to a father. Fineo, mighty well\r\npleased to have so fair a daughter-in-law, caused celebrate her nuptials\r\nmost bravely and gaily, and received, and did ever thereafter entreat,\r\nher as his daughter.\r\n\r\nAnd so he took her, not many days after the festivities were ended, with\r\nhis son and little grandson, aboard a galley, and brought them to\r\nLazistan, and there thenceforth the two lovers dwelt with him in easeful\r\nand lifelong peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VIII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNastagio degli Onesti, loving a damsel of the Traversari family, by\r\nlavish expenditure gains not her love. At the instance of his kinsfolk he\r\nhies him to Chiassi, where he sees a knight hunt a damsel and slay her\r\nand cause her to be devoured by two dogs. He bids his kinsfolk and the\r\nlady that he loves to breakfast. During the meal the said damsel is torn\r\nin pieces before the eyes of the lady, who, fearing a like fate, takes\r\nNastagio to husband.\r\n--\r\n\r\nLauretta was no sooner silent than thus at the queen's behest began\r\nFilomena:--Sweet ladies, as in us pity has ever its meed of praise, even\r\nso Divine justice suffers not our cruelty to escape severe chastisement:\r\nthe which that I may shew you, and thereby dispose you utterly to banish\r\nthat passion from your souls, I am minded to tell you a story no less\r\ntouching than delightsome.\r\n\r\nIn Ravenna, that most ancient city of Romagna, there dwelt of yore\r\nnoblemen and gentlemen not a few, among whom was a young man, Nastagio\r\ndegli Onesti by name, who by the death of his father and one of his\r\nuncles inherited immense wealth. Being without a wife, Nastagio, as 'tis\r\nthe way with young men, became enamoured of a daughter of Messer Paolo\r\nTraversaro, a damsel of much higher birth than his, whose love he hoped\r\nto win by gifts and the like modes of courting, which, albeit they were\r\nexcellent and fair and commendable, not only availed him not, but seemed\r\nrather to have the contrary effect, so harsh and ruthless and unrelenting\r\ndid the beloved damsel shew herself towards him; for whether it was her\r\nuncommon beauty or her noble lineage that puffed her up, so haughty and\r\ndisdainful was she grown that pleasure she had none either in him or in\r\naught that pleased him. The burden of which disdain Nastagio found so\r\nhard to bear, that many a time, when he had made his moan, he longed to\r\nmake away with himself. However he refrained therefrom, and many a time\r\nresolved to give her up altogether, or, if so he might, to hold her in\r\ndespite, as she did him: but 'twas all in vain, for it seemed as if, the\r\nmore his hope dwindled, the greater grew his love. And, as thus he\r\ncontinued, loving and spending inordinately, certain of his kinsfolk and\r\nfriends, being apprehensive lest he should waste both himself and his\r\nsubstance, did many a time counsel and beseech him to depart Ravenna, and\r\ngo tarry for a time elsewhere, that so he might at once cool his flame\r\nand reduce his charges. For a long while Nastagio answered their\r\nadmonitions with banter; but as they continued to ply him with them, he\r\ngrew weary of saying no so often, and promised obedience. Whereupon he\r\nequipped himself as if for a journey to France or Spain, or other distant\r\nparts, got on horseback and sallied forth of Ravenna, accompanied by not\r\na few of his friends, and being come to a place called Chiassi, about\r\nthree miles from Ravenna, he halted, and having sent for tents and\r\npavilions, told his companions that there he meant to stay, and they\r\nmight go back to Ravenna. So Nastagio pitched his camp, and there\r\ncommenced to live after as fine and lordly a fashion as did ever any man,\r\nbidding divers of his friends from time to time to breakfast or sup with\r\nhim, as he had been wont to do. Now it so befell that about the beginning\r\nof May, the season being very fine, he fell a brooding on the cruelty of\r\nhis mistress, and, that his meditations might be the less disturbed, he\r\nbade all his servants leave him, and sauntered slowly, wrapt in thought,\r\nas far as the pinewood. Which he had threaded for a good half-mile, when,\r\nthe fifth hour of the day being well-nigh past, yet he recking neither of\r\nfood nor of aught else, 'twas as if he heard a woman wailing exceedingly\r\nand uttering most piercing shrieks: whereat, the train of his sweet\r\nmelancholy being broken, he raised his head to see what was toward, and\r\nwondered to find himself in the pinewood; and saw, moreover, before him\r\nrunning through a grove, close set with underwood and brambles, towards\r\nthe place where he was, a damsel most comely, stark naked, her hair\r\ndishevelled, and her flesh all torn by the briers and brambles, who wept\r\nand cried piteously for mercy; and at her flanks he saw two mastiffs,\r\nexceeding great and fierce, that ran hard upon her track, and not seldom\r\ncame up with her and bit her cruelly; and in the rear he saw, riding a\r\nblack horse, a knight sadly accoutred, and very wrathful of mien,\r\ncarrying a rapier in his hand, and with despiteful, blood-curdling words\r\nthreatening her with death. Whereat he was at once amazed and appalled,\r\nand then filled with compassion for the hapless lady, whereof was bred a\r\ndesire to deliver her, if so he might, from such anguish and peril of\r\ndeath. Wherefore, as he was unarmed, he ran and took in lieu of a cudgel\r\na branch of a tree, with which he prepared to encounter the dogs and the\r\nknight. Which the knight observing, called to him before he was come to\r\nclose quarters, saying:--\"Hold off, Nastagio, leave the dogs and me alone\r\nto deal with this vile woman as she has deserved.\" And, even as he spoke,\r\nthe dogs gripped the damsel so hard on either flank that they arrested\r\nher flight, and the knight, being come up, dismounted. Whom Nastagio\r\napproached, saying:--\"I know not who thou art, that knowest me so well,\r\nbut thus much I tell thee: 'tis a gross outrage for an armed knight to go\r\nabout to kill a naked woman, and set his dogs upon her as if she were a\r\nwild beast: rest assured that I shall do all I can to protect her.\"\r\nWhereupon:--\"Nastagio,\" replied the knight, \"of the same city as thou was\r\nI, and thou wast yet a little lad when I, Messer Guido degli Anastagi by\r\nname, being far more enamoured of this damsel than thou art now of her of\r\nthe Traversari, was by her haughtiness and cruelty brought to so woeful a\r\npass that one day in a fit of despair I slew myself with this rapier\r\nwhich thou seest in my hand; for which cause I am condemned to the\r\neternal pains. Nor was it long after my death that she, who exulted\r\ntherein over measure, also died, and for that she repented her not of her\r\ncruelty and the joy she had of my sufferings, for which she took not\r\nblame to herself, but merit, was likewise condemned to the pains of hell.\r\nNor had she sooner made her descent, than for her pain and mine 'twas\r\nordained, that she should flee before me, and that I, who so loved her,\r\nshould pursue her, not as my beloved lady, but as my mortal enemy, and\r\nso, as often as I come up with her, I slay her with this same rapier with\r\nwhich I slew myself, and having ripped her up by the back, I take out\r\nthat hard and cold heart, to which neither love nor pity had ever access,\r\nand therewith her other inward parts, as thou shalt forthwith see, and\r\ncast them to these dogs to eat. And in no long time, as the just and\r\nmighty God decrees, she rises even as if she had not died, and\r\nrecommences her dolorous flight, I and the dogs pursuing her. And it so\r\nfalls out that every Friday about this hour I here come up with her, and\r\nslaughter her as thou shalt see; but ween not that we rest on other days;\r\nfor there are other places in which I overtake her, places in which she\r\nused, or devised how she might use, me cruelly; on which wise, changed as\r\nthou seest from her lover into her foe, I am to pursue her for years as\r\nmany as the months during which she shewed herself harsh to me. Wherefore\r\nleave me to execute the decree of the Divine justice, and presume not to\r\noppose that which thou mayst not avail to withstand.\"\r\n\r\nAffrighted by the knight's words, insomuch that there was scarce a hair\r\non his head but stood on end, Nastagio shrank back, still gazing on the\r\nhapless damsel, and waited all a tremble to see what the knight would do.\r\nNor had he long to wait; for the knight, as soon as he had done speaking,\r\nsprang, rapier in hand, like a mad dog upon the damsel, who, kneeling,\r\nwhile the two mastiffs gripped her tightly, cried him mercy; but the\r\nknight, thrusting with all his force, struck her between the breasts, and\r\nran her clean through the body. Thus stricken, the damsel fell forthwith\r\nprone on the ground sobbing and shrieking: whereupon the knight drew\r\nforth a knife, and having therewith opened her in the back, took out the\r\nheart and all the circumjacent parts, and threw them to the two mastiffs,\r\nwho, being famished, forthwith devoured them. And in no long time the\r\ndamsel, as if nought thereof had happened, started to her feet, and took\r\nto flight towards the sea, pursued, and ever and anon bitten, by the\r\ndogs, while the knight, having gotten him to horse again, followed them\r\nas before, rapier in hand; and so fast sped they that they were quickly\r\nlost to Nastagio's sight.\r\n\r\nLong time he stood musing on what he had seen, divided between pity and\r\nterror, and then it occurred to him that, as this passed every Friday, it\r\nmight avail him not a little. So, having marked the place, he rejoined\r\nhis servants, and in due time thereafter sent for some of his kinsfolk\r\nand friends, and said to them:--\"'Tis now a long while that you urge me\r\nto give up loving this lady that is no friend to me, and therewith make\r\nan end of my extravagant way of living; and I am now ready so to do,\r\nprovided you procure me one favour, to wit, that next Friday Messer Paolo\r\nTraversaro, and his wife and daughter, and all the ladies, their\r\nkinswomen, and as many other ladies as you may be pleased to bid, come\r\nhither to breakfast with me: when you will see for yourselves the reason\r\nwhy I so desire.\" A small matter this seemed to them; and so, on their\r\nreturn to Ravenna, they lost no time in conveying Nastagio's message to\r\nhis intended guests: and, albeit she was hardly persuaded, yet in the end\r\nthe damsel that Nastagio loved came with the rest.\r\n\r\nNastagio caused a lordly breakfast to be prepared, and had the tables set\r\nunder the pines about the place where he had witnessed the slaughter of\r\nthe cruel lady; and in ranging the ladies and gentlemen at table he so\r\nordered it, that the damsel whom he loved was placed opposite the spot\r\nwhere it should be enacted. The last course was just served, when the\r\ndespairing cries of the hunted damsel became audible to all, to their no\r\nsmall amazement; and each asking, and none knowing, what it might import,\r\nup they all started intent to see what was toward; and perceived the\r\nsuffering damsel, and the knight and the dogs, who in a trice were in\r\ntheir midst. They hollaed amain to dogs and knight, and not a few\r\nadvanced to succour the damsel: but the words of the knight, which were\r\nsuch as he had used to Nastagio, caused them to fall back,\r\nterror-stricken and lost in amazement. And when the knight proceeded to\r\ndo as he had done before, all the ladies that were there, many of whom\r\nwere of kin to the suffering damsel and to the knight, and called to mind\r\nhis love and death, wept as bitterly as if 'twere their own case.\r\n\r\nWhen 'twas all over, and the lady and the knight had disappeared, the\r\nstrange scene set those that witnessed it pondering many and divers\r\nmatters: but among them all none was so appalled as the cruel damsel that\r\nNastagio loved, who, having clearly seen and heard all that had passed,\r\nand being ware that it touched her more nearly than any other by reason\r\nof the harshness that she had ever shewn to Nastagio, seemed already to\r\nbe fleeing from her angered lover, and to have the mastiffs on her\r\nflanks. And so great was her terror that, lest a like fate should befall\r\nher, she converted her aversion into affection, and as soon as occasion\r\nserved, which was that very night, sent a trusty chambermaid privily to\r\nNastagio with a request that he would be pleased to come to her, for that\r\nshe was ready in all respects to pleasure him to the full. Nastagio made\r\nanswer that he was greatly flattered, but that he was minded with her\r\nconsent to have his pleasure of her in an honourable way, to wit, by\r\nmarrying her. The damsel, who knew that none but herself was to blame\r\nthat she was not already Nastagio's wife, made answer that she consented.\r\nWherefore by her own mouth she acquainted her father and mother that she\r\nagreed to marry Nastagio; and, they heartily approving her choice,\r\nNastagio wedded her on the ensuing Sunday, and lived happily with her\r\nmany a year. Nor was it in her instance alone that this terror was\r\nproductive of good: on the contrary, it so wrought among the ladies of\r\nRavenna that they all became, and have ever since been, much more\r\ncompliant with men's desires than they had been wont to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IX.\r\n\r\n--\r\nFederigo degli Alberighi loves and is not loved in return: he wastes his\r\nsubstance by lavishness until nought is left but a single falcon, which,\r\nhis lady being come to see him at his house, he gives her to eat: she,\r\nknowing his case, changes her mind, takes him to husband and makes him\r\nrich.\r\n--\r\n\r\nSo ended Filomena; and the queen, being ware that besides herself only\r\nDioneo (by virtue of his privilege) was left to speak, said with gladsome\r\nmien:--'Tis now for me to take up my parable; which, dearest ladies, I\r\nwill do with a story like in some degree to the foregoing, and that, not\r\nonly that you may know how potent are your charms to sway the gentle\r\nheart, but that you may also learn how upon fitting occasions to make\r\nbestowal of your guerdons of your own accord, instead of always waiting\r\nfor the guidance of Fortune, which most times, not wisely, but without\r\nrule or measure, scatters her gifts.\r\n\r\nYou are then to know, that Coppo di Borghese Domenichi, a man that in our\r\nday was, and perchance still is, had in respect and great reverence in\r\nour city, being not only by reason of his noble lineage, but, and yet\r\nmore, for manners and merit most illustrious and worthy of eternal\r\nrenown, was in his old age not seldom wont to amuse himself by\r\ndiscoursing of things past with his neighbours and other folk; wherein he\r\nhad not his match for accuracy and compass of memory and concinnity of\r\nspeech. Among other good stories, he would tell, how that there was of\r\nyore in Florence a gallant named Federigo di Messer Filippo Alberighi,\r\nwho for feats of arms and courtesy had not his peer in Tuscany; who, as\r\nis the common lot of gentlemen, became enamoured of a lady named Monna\r\nGiovanna, who in her day held rank among the fairest and most elegant\r\nladies of Florence; to gain whose love he jousted, tilted, gave\r\nentertainments, scattered largess, and in short set no bounds to his\r\nexpenditure. However the lady, no less virtuous than fair, cared not a\r\njot for what he did for her sake, nor yet for him.\r\n\r\nSpending thus greatly beyond his means, and making nothing, Federigo\r\ncould hardly fail to come to lack, and was at length reduced to such\r\npoverty that he had nothing left but a little estate, on the rents of\r\nwhich he lived very straitly, and a single falcon, the best in the world.\r\nThe estate was at Campi, and thither, deeming it no longer possible for\r\nhim to live in the city as he desired, he repaired, more in love than\r\never before; and there, in complete seclusion, diverting himself with\r\nhawking, he bore his poverty as patiently as he might.\r\n\r\nNow, Federigo being thus reduced to extreme poverty, it so happened that\r\none day Monna Giovanna's husband, who was very rich, fell ill, and,\r\nseeing that he was nearing his end, made his will, whereby he left his\r\nestate to his son, who was now growing up, and in the event of his death\r\nwithout lawful heir named Monna Giovanna, whom he dearly loved, heir in\r\nhis stead; and having made these dispositions he died.\r\n\r\nMonna Giovanna, being thus left a widow, did as our ladies are wont, and\r\nrepaired in the summer to one of her estates in the country which lay\r\nvery near to that of Federigo. And so it befell that the urchin began to\r\nmake friends with Federigo, and to shew a fondness for hawks and dogs,\r\nand having seen Federigo's falcon fly not a few times, took a singular\r\nfancy to him, and greatly longed to have him for his own, but still did\r\nnot dare to ask him of Federigo, knowing that Federigo prized him so\r\nmuch. So the matter stood when by chance the boy fell sick; whereby the\r\nmother was sore distressed, for he was her only son, and she loved him as\r\nmuch as might be, insomuch that all day long she was beside him, and\r\nceased not to comfort him, and again and again asked him if there were\r\naught that he wished for, imploring him to say the word, and, if it might\r\nby any means be had, she would assuredly do her utmost to procure it for\r\nhim. Thus repeatedly exhorted, the boy said:--\"Mother mine, do but get me\r\nFederigo's falcon, and I doubt not I shall soon be well.\" Whereupon the\r\nlady was silent a while, bethinking her what she should do. She knew that\r\nFederigo had long loved her, and had never had so much as a single kind\r\nlook from her: wherefore she said to herself:--How can I send or go to\r\nbeg of him this falcon, which by what I hear is the best that ever flew,\r\nand moreover is his sole comfort? And how could I be so unfeeling as to\r\nseek to deprive a gentleman of the one solace that is now left him? And\r\nso, albeit she very well knew that she might have the falcon for the\r\nasking, she was perplexed, and knew not what to say, and gave her son no\r\nanswer. At length, however, the love she bore the boy carried the day,\r\nand she made up her mind, for his contentment, come what might, not to\r\nsend, but to go herself and fetch him the falcon. So:--\"Be of good cheer,\r\nmy son,\" she said, \"and doubt not thou wilt soon be well; for I promise\r\nthee that the very first thing that I shall do tomorrow morning will be\r\nto go and fetch thee the falcon.\" Whereat the child was so pleased that\r\nhe began to mend that very day.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow the lady, as if for pleasure, hied her with another lady to\r\nFederigo's little house, and asked to see him. 'Twas still, as for some\r\ndays past, no weather for hawking, and Federigo was in his garden, busy\r\nabout some small matters which needed to be set right there. When he\r\nheard that Monna Giovanna was at the door, asking to see him, he was not\r\na little surprised and pleased, and hied him to her with all speed. As\r\nsoon as she saw him, she came forward to meet him with womanly grace, and\r\nhaving received his respectful salutation, said to him:--\"Good morrow,\r\nFederigo,\" and continued:--\"I am come to requite thee for what thou hast\r\nlost by loving me more than thou shouldst: which compensation is this,\r\nthat I and this lady that accompanies me will breakfast with thee without\r\nceremony this morning.\" \"Madam,\" Federigo replied with all humility, \"I\r\nmind not ever to have lost aught by loving you, but rather to have been\r\nso much profited that, if I ever deserved well in aught, 'twas to your\r\nmerit that I owed it, and to the love that I bore you. And of a surety\r\nhad I still as much to spend as I have spent in the past, I should not\r\nprize it so much as this visit you so frankly pay me, come as you are to\r\none who can afford you but a sorry sort of hospitality.\" Which said, with\r\nsome confusion, he bade her welcome to his house, and then led her into\r\nhis garden, where, having none else to present to her by way of\r\ncompanion, he said:--\"Madam, as there is none other here, this good\r\nwoman, wife of this husbandman, will bear you company, while I go to have\r\nthe table set.\" Now, albeit his poverty was extreme, yet he had not known\r\nas yet how sore was the need to which his extravagance had reduced him;\r\nbut this morning 'twas brought home to him, for that he could find nought\r\nwherewith to do honour to the lady, for love of whom he had done the\r\nhonours of his house to men without number: wherefore, distressed beyond\r\nmeasure, and inwardly cursing his evil fortune, he sped hither and\r\nthither like one beside himself, but never a coin found he, nor yet aught\r\nto pledge. Meanwhile it grew late, and sorely he longed that the lady\r\nmight not leave his house altogether unhonoured, and yet to crave help of\r\nhis own husbandman was more than his pride could brook. In these\r\ndesperate straits his glance happened to fall on his brave falcon on his\r\nperch in his little parlour. And so, as a last resource, he took him, and\r\nfinding him plump, deemed that he would make a dish meet for such a lady.\r\nWherefore, without thinking twice about it, he wrung the bird's neck, and\r\ncaused his maid forthwith pluck him and set him on a spit, and roast him\r\ncarefully; and having still some spotless table linen, he had the table\r\nlaid therewith, and with a cheerful countenance hied him back to his lady\r\nin the garden, and told her that such breakfast as he could give her was\r\nready. So the lady and her companion rose and came to table, and there,\r\nwith Federigo, who waited on them most faithfully, ate the brave falcon,\r\nknowing not what they ate.\r\n\r\nWhen they were risen from table, and had dallied a while in gay converse\r\nwith him, the lady deemed it time to tell the reason of her visit:\r\nwherefore, graciously addressing Federigo, thus began she:--\"Federigo, by\r\nwhat thou rememberest of thy past life and my virtue, which, perchance,\r\nthou hast deemed harshness and cruelty, I doubt not thou must marvel at\r\nmy presumption, when thou hearest the main purpose of my visit; but if\r\nthou hadst sons, or hadst had them, so that thou mightest know the full\r\nforce of the love that is borne them, I should make no doubt that thou\r\nwouldst hold me in part excused. Nor, having a son, may I, for that thou\r\nhast none, claim exemption from the laws to which all other mothers are\r\nsubject, and, being thus bound to own their sway, I must, though fain\r\nwere I not, and though 'tis neither meet nor right, crave of thee that\r\nwhich I know thou dost of all things and with justice prize most highly,\r\nseeing that this extremity of thy adverse fortune has left thee nought\r\nelse wherewith to delight, divert and console thee; which gift is no\r\nother than thy falcon, on which my boy has so set his heart that, if I\r\nbring him it not, I fear lest he grow so much worse of the malady that he\r\nhas, that thereby it may come to pass that I lose him. And so, not for\r\nthe love which thou dost bear me, and which may nowise bind thee, but for\r\nthat nobleness of temper, whereof in courtesy more conspicuously than in\r\naught else thou hast given proof, I implore thee that thou be pleased to\r\ngive me the bird, that thereby I may say that I have kept my son alive,\r\nand thus made him for aye thy debtor.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Federigo apprehended what the lady wanted, than, for grief\r\nthat 'twas not in his power to serve her, because he had given her the\r\nfalcon to eat, he fell a weeping in her presence, before he could so much\r\nas utter a word. At first the lady supposed that 'twas only because he\r\nwas loath to part with the brave falcon that he wept, and as good as made\r\nup her mind that he would refuse her: however, she awaited with patience\r\nFederigo's answer, which was on this wise:--\"Madam, since it pleased God\r\nthat I should set my affections upon you there have been matters not a\r\nfew, in which to my sorrow I have deemed Fortune adverse to me; but they\r\nhave all been trifles in comparison of the trick that she now plays me:\r\nthe which I shall never forgive her, seeing that you are come here to my\r\npoor house, where, while I was rich, you deigned not to come, and ask a\r\ntrifling favour of me, which she has put it out of my power to grant: how\r\n'tis so, I will briefly tell you. When I learned that you, of your grace,\r\nwere minded to breakfast with me, having respect to your high dignity and\r\ndesert, I deemed it due and seemly that in your honour I should regale\r\nyou, to the best of my power, with fare of a more excellent quality than\r\nis commonly set before others; and, calling to mind the falcon which you\r\nnow ask of me, and his excellence, I judged him meet food for you, and so\r\nyou have had him roasted on the trencher this morning; and well indeed I\r\nthought I had bestowed him; but, as now I see that you would fain have\r\nhad him in another guise, so mortified am I that I am not able to serve\r\nyou, that I doubt I shall never know peace of mind more.\" In witness\r\nwhereof he had the feathers and feet and beak of the bird brought in and\r\nlaid before her.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the lady did, when she had heard Federigo's story, and\r\nseen the relics of the bird, was to chide him that he had killed so fine\r\na falcon to furnish a woman with a breakfast; after which the magnanimity\r\nof her host, which poverty had been and was powerless to impair, elicited\r\nno small share of inward commendation. Then, frustrate of her hope of\r\npossessing the falcon, and doubting of her son's recovery, she took her\r\nleave with the heaviest of hearts, and hied her back to the boy: who,\r\nwhether for fretting, that he might not have the falcon, or by the\r\nunaided energy of his disorder, departed this life not many days after,\r\nto the exceeding great grief of his mother. For a while she would do\r\nnought but weep and bitterly bewail herself; but being still young, and\r\nleft very wealthy, she was often urged by her brothers to marry again,\r\nand though she would rather have not done so, yet being importuned, and\r\nremembering Federigo's high desert, and the magnificent generosity with\r\nwhich he had finally killed his falcon to do her honour, she said to her\r\nbrothers:--\"Gladly, with your consent, would I remain a widow, but if you\r\nwill not be satisfied except I take a husband, rest assured that none\r\nother will I ever take save Federigo degli Alberighi.\" Whereupon her\r\nbrothers derided her, saying:--\"Foolish woman, what is't thou sayst? How\r\nshouldst thou want Federigo, who has not a thing in the world?\" To whom\r\nshe answered:--\"My brothers, well wot I that 'tis as you say; but I had\r\nrather have a man without wealth than wealth without a man.\" The\r\nbrothers, perceiving that her mind was made up, and knowing Federigo for\r\na good man and true, poor though he was, gave her to him with all her\r\nwealth. And so Federigo, being mated with such a wife, and one that he\r\nhad so much loved, and being very wealthy to boot, lived happily, keeping\r\nmore exact accounts, to the end of his days.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL X.\r\n\r\n--\r\nPietro di Vinciolo goes from home to sup: his wife brings a boy into the\r\nhouse to bear her company: Pietro returns, and she hides her gallant\r\nunder a hen-coop: Pietro explains that in the house of Ercolano, with\r\nwhom he was to have supped, there was discovered a young man bestowed\r\nthere by Ercolano's wife: the lady thereupon censures Ercolano's wife:\r\nbut unluckily an ass treads on the fingers of the boy that is hidden\r\nunder the hen-coop, so that he cries for pain: Pietro runs to the place,\r\nsees him, and apprehends the trick played on him by his wife, which\r\nnevertheless he finally condones, for that he is not himself free from\r\nblame.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen the queen had done speaking, and all had praised God that He had\r\nworthily rewarded Federigo, Dioneo, who never waited to be bidden, thus\r\nbegan:--I know not whether I am to term it a vice accidental and\r\nsuperinduced by bad habits in us mortals, or whether it be a fault seated\r\nin nature, that we are more prone to laugh at things dishonourable than\r\nat good deeds, and that more especially when they concern not ourselves.\r\nHowever, as the sole scope of all my efforts has been and still shall be\r\nto dispel your melancholy, and in lieu thereof to minister to you\r\nlaughter and jollity; therefore, enamoured my damsels, albeit the ensuing\r\nstory is not altogether free from matter that is scarce seemly, yet, as\r\nit may afford you pleasure, I shall not fail to relate it; premonishing\r\nyou my hearers, that you take it with the like discretion as when, going\r\ninto your gardens, you stretch forth your delicate hands and cull the\r\nroses, leaving the thorns alone: which, being interpreted, means that you\r\nwill leave the caitiff husband to abide in sorry plight with his\r\ndishonour, and will gaily laugh at the amorous wiles or his wife, and\r\ncommiserate her unfortunate gallant, when occasion requires.\r\n\r\n'Tis no great while since there dwelt at Perugia a rich man named Pietro\r\ndi Vinciolo, who rather, perchance, to blind others and mitigate the evil\r\nrepute in which he was held by the citizens of Perugia, than for any\r\ndesire to wed, took a wife: and such being his motive, Fortune provided\r\nhim with just such a spouse as he merited. For the wife of his choice was\r\na stout, red-haired young woman, and so hot-blooded that two husbands\r\nwould have been more to her mind than one, whereas one fell to her lot\r\nthat gave her only a subordinate place in his regard. Which she\r\nperceiving, while she knew herself to be fair and lusty, and felt herself\r\nto be gamesome and fit, waxed very wroth, and now and again had high\r\nwords with her husband, and led but a sorry life with him at most times.\r\nThen, seeing that thereby she was more like to fret herself than to\r\ndispose her husband to conduct less base, she said to herself:--This poor\r\ncreature deserts me to go walk in pattens in the dry; wherefore it shall\r\ngo hard but I will bring another aboard the ship for the wet weather. I\r\nmarried him, and brought him a great and goodly dowry, knowing that he\r\nwas a man, and supposing him to have the desires which men have and ought\r\nto have; and had I not deemed him to be a man, I should never have\r\nmarried him. He knew me to be a woman: why then took he me to wife, if\r\nwomen were not to his mind? 'Tis not to be endured. Had I not been minded\r\nto live in the world, I had become a nun; and being minded there to live,\r\nas I am, if I am to wait until I have pleasure or solace of him, I shall\r\nwait perchance until I am old; and then, too late, I shall bethink me to\r\nmy sorrow that I have wasted my youth; and as to the way in which I\r\nshould seek its proper solace I need no better teacher and guide than\r\nhim, who finds his delight where I should find mine, and finds it to his\r\nown condemnation, whereas in me 'twere commendable. 'Tis but the laws\r\nthat I shall set at nought, whereas he sets both them and Nature herself\r\nat nought.\r\n\r\nSo the good lady reasoned, and peradventure more than once; and then,\r\ncasting about how she might privily compass her end, she made friends\r\nwith an old beldam, that shewed as a veritable Santa Verdiana,\r\nfoster-mother of vipers, who was ever to be seen going to pardonings with\r\na parcel of paternosters in her hand, and talked of nothing but the lives\r\nof the holy Fathers, and the wounds of St. Francis, and was generally\r\nreputed a saint; to whom in due time she opened her whole mind. \"My\r\ndaughter,\" replied the beldam, \"God, who knows all things, knows that\r\nthou wilt do very rightly indeed: were it for no other reason, 'twould be\r\nmeet for thee and every other young woman so to do, that the heyday of\r\nyouth be not wasted; for there is no grief like that of knowing that it\r\nhas been wasted. And what the devil are we women fit for when we are old\r\nexcept to pore over the cinders on the hearth? The which if any know, and\r\nmay attest it, 'tis I, who, now that I am old, call to mind the time that\r\nI let slip from me, not without most sore and bitter and fruitless\r\nregret: and albeit 'twas not all wasted, for I would not have thee think\r\nthat I was entirely without sense, yet I did not make the best use of it:\r\nwhereof when I bethink me, and that I am now, even as thou seest me, such\r\na hag that never a spark of fire may I hope to get from any, God knows\r\nhow I rue it. Now with men 'tis otherwise: they are born meet for a\r\nthousand uses, not for this alone; and the more part of them are of much\r\ngreater consequence in old age than in youth: but women are fit for\r\nnought but this, and 'tis but for that they bear children that they are\r\ncherished. Whereof, if not otherwise, thou mayst assure thyself, if thou\r\ndo but consider that we are ever ready for it; which is not the case with\r\nmen; besides which, one woman will tire out many men without being\r\nherself tired out. Seeing then that 'tis for this we are born, I tell\r\nthee again that thou wilt do very rightly to give thy husband thy loaf\r\nfor his cake, that in thy old age thy soul may have no cause of complaint\r\nagainst thy flesh. Every one has just as much of this life as he\r\nappropriates: and this is especially true of women, whom therefore it\r\nbehoves, much more than men, to seize the moment as it flies: indeed, as\r\nthou mayst see for thyself, when we grow old neither husband, nor any\r\nother man will spare us a glance; but, on the contrary, they banish us to\r\nthe kitchen, there to tell stories to the cat, and to count the pots and\r\npans; or, worse, they make rhymes about us:--'To the damsel dainty bits;\r\nto the beldam ague-fits;' and such-like catches. But to make no more\r\nwords about it, I tell thee at once that there is no person in the world\r\nto whom thou couldst open thy mind with more advantage than to me; for\r\nthere is no gentleman so fine but I dare speak my mind to him, nor any so\r\nharsh and forbidding but I know well how to soften him and fashion him to\r\nmy will. Tell me only what thou wouldst have, and leave the rest to me:\r\nbut one word more: I pray thee to have me in kindly remembrance, for that\r\nI am poor; and thou shalt henceforth go shares with me in all my\r\nindulgences and every paternoster that I say, that God may make thereof\r\nlight and tapers for thy dead:\" wherewith she ended.\r\n\r\nSo the lady came to an understanding with the beldam, that, as soon as\r\nshe set eyes on a boy that often came along that street, and of whom the\r\nlady gave her a particular description, she would know what she was to\r\ndo: and thereupon the lady gave her a chunk of salt meat, and bade her\r\nGod-speed. The beldam before long smuggled into the lady's chamber the\r\nboy of whom she had spoken, and not long after another, such being the\r\nhumour of the lady, who, standing in perpetual dread of her husband, was\r\ndisposed, in this particular, to make the most of her opportunities. And\r\none of these days, her husband being to sup in the evening with a friend\r\nnamed Ercolano, the lady bade the beldam bring her a boy as pretty and\r\ndainty as was to be found in Perugia; and so the beldam forthwith did.\r\nBut the lady and the boy being set at table to sup, lo, Pietro's voice\r\nwas heard at the door, bidding open to him. Whereupon the lady gave\r\nherself up for dead; but being fain, if she might, to screen the boy, and\r\nknowing not where else to convey or conceal him, bestowed him under a\r\nhen-coop that stood in a veranda hard by the chamber in which they were\r\nsupping, and threw over it a sorry mattress that she had that day emptied\r\nof its straw; which done she hastened to open the door to her husband;\r\nsaying to him as he entered:--\"You have gulped your supper mighty quickly\r\nto-night.\" Whereto Pietro replied:--\"We have not so much as tasted it.\"\r\n\"How so?\" enquired the lady. \"I will tell thee,\" said Pietro. \"No sooner\r\nwere we set at table, Ercolano, his wife, and I, than we heard a sneeze\r\nclose to us, to which, though 'twas repeated, we paid no heed; but as the\r\nsneezer continued to sneeze a third, a fourth, a fifth, and many another\r\ntime to boot, we all began to wonder, and Ercolano, who was somewhat out\r\nof humour with his wife, because she had kept us a long time at the door\r\nbefore she opened it, burst out in a sort of rage with:--'What means\r\nthis? Who is't that thus sneezes?' and made off to a stair hard by,\r\nbeneath which and close to its foot was a wooden closet, of the sort\r\nwhich, when folk are furnishing their houses, they commonly cause to be\r\nplaced there, to stow things in upon occasion. And as it seemed to him\r\nthat the sneezing proceeded thence, he undid the wicket, and no sooner\r\nhad he opened it than out flew never so strong a stench of brimstone;\r\nalbeit we had already been saluted by a whiff of it, and complained\r\nthereof, but had been put off by the lady with:--''Tis but that a while\r\nago I bleached my veils with brimstone, having sprinkled it on a dish,\r\nthat they might catch its fumes, which dish I then placed under the\r\nstair, so that it still smells a little.'\r\n\r\n\"However the door being now, as I have said, open, and the smoke somewhat\r\nless dense, Ercolano, peering in, espied the fellow that had sneezed, and\r\nwho still kept sneezing, being thereto constrained by the pungency of the\r\nbrimstone. And for all he sneezed, yet was he by this time so well-nigh\r\nchoked with the brimstone that he was like neither to sneeze nor to do\r\naught else again. As soon as he caught sight of him, Ercolano bawled\r\nout:--'Now see I, Madam, why it was that a while ago, when we came here,\r\nwe were kept waiting so long at the gate before 'twas opened; but woe\r\nbetide me for the rest of my days, if I pay you not out.' Whereupon the\r\nlady, perceiving that her offence was discovered, ventured no excuse, but\r\nfled from the table, whither I know not. Ercolano, ignoring his wife's\r\nflight, bade the sneezer again and again to come forth; but he, being by\r\nthis time fairly spent, budged not an inch for aught that Ercolano said.\r\nWherefore Ercolano caught him by one of his feet, and dragged him forth,\r\nand ran off for a knife with intent to kill him; but I, standing in fear\r\nof the Signory on my own account, got up and would not suffer him to kill\r\nthe fellow or do him any hurt, and for his better protection raised the\r\nalarm, whereby some of the neighbours came up and took the lad, more dead\r\nthan alive, and bore him off, I know not whither. However, our supper\r\nbeing thus rudely interrupted, not only have not gulped it, but I have\r\nnot so much as tasted it, as I said before!\"\r\n\r\nHer husband's story shewed his wife that there were other ladies as\r\nknowing as she, albeit misfortune might sometimes overtake them and\r\ngladly would she have spoken out in defence of Ercolano's wife, but,\r\nthinking that, by censuring another's sin, she would secure more scope\r\nfor her own, she launched out on this wise:--\"Fine doings indeed, a right\r\nvirtuous and saintly lady she must be: here is the loyalty of an honest\r\nwoman, and one to whom I had lief have confessed, so spiritual I deemed\r\nher; and the worst of it is that, being no longer young, she sets a rare\r\nexample to those that are so. Curses on the hour that she came into the\r\nworld: curses upon her that she make not away with herself, basest, most\r\nfaithless of women that she must needs be, the reproach of her sex, the\r\nopprobrium of all the ladies of this city, to cast aside all regard for\r\nher honour, her marriage vow, her reputation before the world, and, lost\r\nto all sense of shame, to scruple not to bring disgrace upon a man so\r\nworthy, a citizen so honourable, a husband by whom she was so well\r\ntreated, ay, and upon herself to boot! By my hope of salvation no mercy\r\nshould be shewn to such women; they should pay the penalty with their\r\nlives; to the fire with them while they yet live, and let them be burned\r\nto ashes.\" Then, calling to mind the lover that she had close at hand in\r\nthe hen-coop, she fell to coaxing Pietro to get him to bed, for the hour\r\ngrew late. Pietro, who was more set on eating than sleeping, only asked\r\nwhether there was aught he might have by way of supper. \"Supper,\r\nforsooth!\" replied the lady. \"Ay, of course 'tis our way to make much of\r\nsupper when thou art not at home. As if I were Ercolano's wife! Now,\r\nwherefore tarry longer? Go, get thy night's rest: 'twere far better for\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\nNow so it was that some of Pietro's husbandmen had come to the house that\r\nevening with divers things from the farm, and had put up their asses in a\r\nstable that adjoined the veranda, but had neglected to water them; and\r\none of the asses being exceeding thirsty, got his head out of the halter\r\nand broke loose from the stable, and went about nosing everything, if\r\nhaply he might come by water: whereby he came upon the hen-coop, beneath\r\nwhich was the boy; who, being constrained to stand on all fours, had the\r\nfingers of one hand somewhat protruding from under the hen-coop; and so\r\nas luck or rather ill-luck would have it, the ass trod on them; whereat,\r\nbeing sorely hurt, he set up a great howling, much to the surprise of\r\nPietro, who perceived that 'twas within his house. So forth he came, and\r\nhearing the boy still moaning and groaning, for the ass still kept his\r\nhoof hard down on the fingers, called out:--\"Who is there?\" and ran to\r\nthe hen-coop and raised it, and espied the fellow, who, besides the pain\r\nthat the crushing of his fingers by the ass's hoof occasioned him,\r\ntrembled in every limb for fear that Pietro should do him a mischief. He\r\nwas one that Pietro had long been after for his foul purposes: so Pietro,\r\nrecognizing him, asked him:--\"What dost thou here?\" The boy making no\r\nanswer, save to beseech him for the love of God to do him no hurt, Pietro\r\ncontinued:--\"Get up, have no fear that I shall hurt thee; but tell\r\nme:--How, and for what cause comest thou to be here?\" The boy then\r\nconfessed everything. Whereupon Pietro, as elated by the discovery as his\r\nwife was distressed, took him by the hand; and led him into the room\r\nwhere the lady in the extremity of terror awaited him; and, having seated\r\nhimself directly in front of her, said:--\"'Twas but a moment ago that\r\nthou didst curse Ercolano's wife, and averred that she ought to be\r\nburned, and that she was the reproach of your sex: why saidst thou not,\r\nof thyself? Or, if thou wast not minded to accuse thyself, how hadst thou\r\nthe effrontery to censure her, knowing that thou hadst done even as she?\r\nVerily 'twas for no other reason than that ye are all fashioned thus, and\r\nstudy to cover your own misdeeds with the delinquencies of others: would\r\nthat fire might fall from heaven and burn you all, brood of iniquity that\r\nye are!\"\r\n\r\nThe lady, marking that in the first flush of his wrath he had given her\r\nnothing worse than hard words, and discerning, as she thought, that he\r\nwas secretly overjoyed to hold so beautiful a boy by the hand, took heart\r\nof grace and said:--\"I doubt not indeed that thou wouldst be well pleased\r\nthat fire should fall from heaven and devour us all, seeing that thou art\r\nas fond of us as a dog is of the stick, though by the Holy Rood thou wilt\r\nbe disappointed; but I would fain have a little argument with thee, to\r\nknow whereof thou complainest. Well indeed were it with me, didst thou\r\nbut place me on an equality with Ercolano's wife, who is an old\r\nsanctimonious hypocrite, and has of him all that she wants, and is\r\ncherished by him as a wife should be: but that is not my case. For,\r\ngranted that thou givest me garments and shoes to my mind, thou knowest\r\nhow otherwise ill bested I am, and how long it is since last thou didst\r\nlie with me; and far liefer had I go barefoot and in rags, and have thy\r\nbenevolence abed, than have all that I have, and be treated as thou dost\r\ntreat me. Understand me, Pietro, be reasonable; consider that I am a\r\nwoman like other women, with the like craving; whereof if thou deny me\r\nthe gratification, 'tis no blame to me that I seek it elsewhere; and at\r\nleast I do thee so much honour as not forgather with stable-boys or\r\nscurvy knaves.\"\r\n\r\nPietro perceived that she was like to continue in this vein the whole\r\nnight: wherefore, indifferent as he was to her, he said:--\"Now, Madam, no\r\nmore of this; in the matter of which thou speakest I will content thee;\r\nbut of thy great courtesy let us have something to eat by way of supper;\r\nfor, methinks, the boy, as well as I, has not yet supped.\" \"Ay, true\r\nenough,\" said the lady, \"he has not supped; for we were but just sitting\r\ndown to table to sup, when, beshrew thee, thou madest thy appearance.\"\r\n\"Go then,\" said Pietro, \"get us some supper; and by and by I will arrange\r\nthis affair in such a way that thou shalt have no more cause of\r\ncomplaint.\" The lady, perceiving that her husband was now tranquil, rose,\r\nand soon had the table laid again and spread with the supper which she\r\nhad ready; and so they made a jolly meal of it, the caitiff husband, the\r\nlady and the boy. What after supper Pietro devised for their mutual\r\nsatisfaction has slipped from my memory. But so much as this I know, that\r\non the morrow as he wended his way to the piazza, the boy would have been\r\npuzzled to say, whether of the twain, the wife or the husband, had had\r\nthe most of his company during the night. But this I would say to you,\r\ndear my ladies, that whoso gives you tit, why, just give him tat; and if\r\nyou cannot do it at once, why, bear it in mind until you can, that even\r\nas the ass gives, so he may receive.\r\n\r\nDioneo's story, whereat the ladies laughed the less for shamefastness\r\nrather than for disrelish, being ended, the queen, taking note that the\r\nterm of her sovereignty was come, rose to her feet, and took off the\r\nlaurel wreath and set it graciously upon Elisa's head, saying:--\"Madam,\r\n'tis now your turn to bear sway.\" The dignity accepted, Elisa followed in\r\nall respects the example of her predecessors: she first conferred with\r\nthe seneschal, and directed him how meetly to order all things during the\r\ntime of her sovereignty; which done to the satisfaction of the\r\ncompany:--\"Ofttimes,\" quoth she, \"have we heard how with bright sallies,\r\nand ready retorts, and sudden devices, not a few have known how to repugn\r\nwith apt checks the bites of others, or to avert imminent perils; and\r\nbecause 'tis an excellent argument, and may be profitable, I ordain that\r\nto-morrow, God helping us, the following be the rule of our discourse; to\r\nwit, that it be of such as by some sprightly sally have repulsed an\r\nattack, or by some ready retort or device have avoided loss, peril or\r\nscorn.\" The rule being heartily approved by all, the queen rose and\r\ndismissed them till supper-time. So the honourable company, seeing the\r\nqueen risen, rose all likewise, and as their wont was, betook them to\r\ntheir diversions as to each seemed best. But when the cicalas had hushed\r\ntheir chirping, all were mustered again for supper; and having blithely\r\nfeasted, they all addressed them to song and dance. And the queen, while\r\nEmilia led a dance, called for a song from Dioneo, who at once came out\r\nwith:--'Monna Aldruda, come perk up thy mood, a piece of glad tidings I\r\nbring thee.' Whereat all the ladies fell a laughing, and most of all the\r\nqueen, who bade him give them no more of that, but sing another. Quoth\r\nDioneo:--\"Madam, had I a tabret, I would sing:--'Up with your smock,\r\nMonna Lapa!' or:--'Oh! the greensward under the olive!' Or perchance you\r\nhad liefer I should give you:--'Woe is me, the wave of the sea!' But no\r\ntabret have I: wherefore choose which of these others you will have.\r\nPerchance you would like:--'Now hie thee to us forth, that so it may be\r\ncut, as May the fields about.'\" \"No,\" returned the queen, \"give us\r\nanother.\" \"Then,\" said Dioneo, \"I will sing:--'Monna Simona, embarrel,\r\nembarrel. Why, 'tis not the month of October.'\"(1) \"Now a plague upon\r\nthee,\" said the queen, with a laugh; \"give us a proper song, wilt thou?\r\nfor we will have none of these.\" \"Never fear, Madam,\" replied Dioneo;\r\n\"only say which you prefer. I have more than a thousand songs by heart.\r\nPerhaps you would like:--'This my little covert, make I ne'er it overt';\r\nor:--'Gently, gently, husband mine'; or:--'A hundred pounds were none too\r\nhigh a price for me a cock to buy.'\" The queen now shewed some offence,\r\nthough the other ladies laughed, and:--\"A truce to thy jesting, Dioneo,\"\r\nsaid she, \"and give us a proper song: else thou mayst prove the quality\r\nof my ire.\" Whereupon Dioneo forthwith ceased his fooling, and sang on\r\nthis wise:--\r\n\r\nSo ravishing a light\r\n  Doth from the fair eyes of my mistress move\r\n  As keeps me slave to her and thee, O Love.\r\n\r\nA beam from those bright orbs did radiate\r\n  That flame that through mine own eyes to my breast\r\n  Did whilom entrance gain.\r\n  Thy majesty, O Love, thy might, how great\r\n  They be, 'twas her fair face did manifest:\r\n  Whereon to brood still fain,\r\n  I felt thee take and chain\r\n  Each sense, my soul enthralling on such wise\r\n  That she alone henceforth evokes my sighs.\r\n\r\nWherefore, O dear my Lord, myself I own\r\n  Thy slave, and, all obedience, wait and yearn,\r\n  Till thy might me console.\r\n  Yet wot I not if it be throughly known\r\n  How noble is the flame wherewith I burn,\r\n  My loyalty how whole\r\n  To her that doth control\r\n  Ev'n in such sort my mind that shall I none,\r\n  Nor would I, peace receive, save hers alone.\r\n\r\nAnd so I pray thee, sweet my Lord, that thou\r\n  Give her to feel thy fire, and shew her plain\r\n  How grievous my disease.\r\n  This service deign to render; for that now\r\n  Thou seest me waste for love, and in the pain\r\n  Dissolve me by degrees:\r\n  And then the apt moment seize\r\n  My cause to plead with her, as is but due\r\n  From thee to me, who fain with thee would sue.\r\n\r\nWhen Dioneo's silence shewed that his song was ended, the queen accorded\r\nit no stinted meed of praise; after which she caused not a few other\r\nsongs to be sung. Thus passed some part of the night; and then the queen,\r\ntaking note that its freshness had vanquished the heat of the day, bade\r\nall go rest them, if they would, till the morning.\r\n\r\n(1) The song is evidently amoebean.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nEndeth here the fifth day of the Decameron, beginneth the sixth, wherein,\r\nunder the rule of Elisa, discourse is had of such as by some sprightly\r\nsally have repulsed an attack, or by some ready retort or device have\r\navoided loss, peril or scorn.\r\n--\r\n\r\nStill in mid heaven, the moon had lost her radiance, nor was any part of\r\nour world unillumined by the fresh splendour of the dawn, when, the queen\r\nbeing risen and having mustered her company, they hied them, gently\r\nsauntering, across the dewy mead some distance from the beautiful hill,\r\nconversing now of this, now of the other matter, canvassing the stories,\r\ntheir greater or less degree of beauty, and laughing afresh at divers of\r\ntheir incidents, until, the sun being now in his higher ascendant, they\r\nbegan to feel his heat, and turning back by common consent, retraced\r\ntheir steps to the palace, where, the tables being already set, and\r\nfragrant herbs and fair flowers strewn all about, they by the queen's\r\ncommand, before it should grow hotter, addressed themselves to their\r\nmeal. So, having blithely breakfasted, they first of all sang some dainty\r\nand jocund ditties, and then, as they were severally minded, composed\r\nthem to sleep or sat them down to chess or dice, while Dioneo and\r\nLauretta fell a singing of Troilus and Cressida.\r\n\r\nThe hour of session being come, they took their places, at the queen's\r\nsummons, in their wonted order by the fountain; but, when the queen was\r\nabout to call for the first story, that happened which had not happened\r\nbefore; to wit, there being a great uproar in the kitchen among the maids\r\nand men, the sound thereof reached the ears of the queen and all the\r\ncompany. Whereupon the queen called the seneschal and asked him who\r\nbawled so loud, and what was the occasion of the uproar. The seneschal\r\nmade answer that 'twas some contention between Licisca and Tindaro; but\r\nthe occasion he knew not, having but just come to quiet them, when he\r\nreceived her summons. The queen then bade him cause Licisca and Tindaro\r\nto come thither forthwith: so they came, and the queen enquired of them\r\nthe cause of the uproar. Tindaro was about to make answer, when Licisca,\r\nwho was somewhat advanced in years, and disposed to give herself airs,\r\nand heated to the strife of words, turned to Tindaro, and scowling upon\r\nhim said:--\"Unmannerly varlet that makest bold to speak before me; leave\r\nme to tell the story.\" Then, turning to the queen, she said:--\"Madam,\r\nthis fellow would fain instruct me as to Sicofante's wife, and--neither\r\nmore or less--as if I had not known her well--would have me believe that,\r\nthe first night that Sicofante lay with her, 'twas by force and not\r\nwithout effusion of blood that Master Yard made his way into Dusky Hill;\r\nwhich I deny, averring that he met with no resistance, but, on the\r\ncontrary, with a hearty welcome on the part of the garrison. And such a\r\nnumskull is he as fondly to believe that the girls are so simple as to\r\nlet slip their opportunities, while they wait on the caprice of father or\r\nbrothers, who six times out of seven delay to marry them for three or\r\nfour years after they should. Ay, ay indeed, doubtless they were well\r\nadvised to tarry so long! Christ's faith! I should know the truth of what\r\nI swear; there is never a woman in my neighbourhood whose husband had her\r\nvirginity; and well I know how many and what manner of tricks our married\r\ndames play their husbands; and yet this booby would fain teach me to know\r\nwomen as if I were but born yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Licisca thus spoke, the ladies laughed till all their teeth were\r\nready to start from their heads. Six times at least the queen bade her be\r\nsilent: but all in vain; she halted not till she had said all that she\r\nhad a mind to. When she had done, the queen turned with a smile to Dioneo\r\nsaying:--\"This is a question for thee to deal with, Dioneo; so hold\r\nthyself in readiness to give final judgment upon it, when our stories are\r\nended.\" \"Madam,\" replied Dioneo forthwith, \"I give judgment without more\r\nado: I say that Licisca is in the right; I believe that 'tis even as she\r\nsays, and that Tindaro is a fool.\" Whereupon Licisca burst out laughing,\r\nand turning to Tindaro:--\"Now did I not tell thee so?\" quoth she. \"Begone\r\nin God's name: dost think to know more than I, thou that art but a\r\nsucking babe? Thank God, I have not lived for nothing, not I.\" And had\r\nnot the queen sternly bade her be silent, and make no more disturbance,\r\nunless she had a mind to be whipped, and sent both her and Tindaro back\r\nto the kitchen, the whole day would have been spent in nought but\r\nlistening to her. So Licisca and Tindaro having withdrawn, the queen\r\ncharged Filomena to tell the first story: and gaily thus Filomena began.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL I.\r\n\r\n--\r\nA knight offers to carry Madonna Oretta a horseback with a story, but\r\ntells it so ill that she prays him to dismount her.\r\n--\r\n\r\nAs stars are set for an ornament in the serene expanse of heaven, and\r\nlikewise in springtime flowers and leafy shrubs in the green meadows, so,\r\ndamsels, in the hour of rare and excellent discourse, is wit with its\r\nbright sallies. Which, being brief, are much more proper for ladies than\r\nfor men, seeing that prolixity of speech, where brevity is possible, is\r\nmuch less allowable to them. But for whatever cause, be it the sorry\r\nquality of our understanding, or some especial enmity that heaven bears\r\nto our generation, few ladies or none are left to-day that, when occasion\r\nprompts, are able to meet it with apt speech, ay, or if aught of the kind\r\nthey hear, can understand it aright: to our common shame be it spoken!\r\nBut as, touching this matter, enough has already been said by\r\nPampinea,(1) I purpose not to enlarge thereon; but, that you may know\r\nwhat excellence resides in speech apt for the occasion, I am minded to\r\ntell you after how courteous a fashion a lady imposed silence upon a\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n'Tis no long time since there dwelt in our city a lady, noble, debonair\r\nand of excellent discourse, whom not a few of you may have seen or heard\r\nof, whose name--for such high qualities merit not oblivion--was Madonna\r\nOretta, her husband being Messer Geri Spina. Now this lady, happening to\r\nbe, as we are, in the country, moving from place to place for pleasure\r\nwith a company of ladies and gentlemen, whom she had entertained the day\r\nbefore at breakfast at her house, and the place of their next sojourn,\r\nwhither they were to go afoot, being some considerable distance off, one\r\nof the gentlemen of the company said to her:--\"Madonna Oretta, so please\r\nyou, I will carry you great part of the way a horseback with one of the\r\nfinest stories in the world.\" \"Indeed, Sir,\" replied the lady, \"I pray\r\nyou do so; and I shall deem it the greatest of favours.\" Whereupon the\r\ngentleman, who perhaps was no better master of his weapon than of his\r\nstory, began a tale, which in itself was indeed excellent, but which, by\r\nrepeating the same word three, four or six times, and now and again\r\nharking back, and saying:--\"I said not well\"; and erring not seldom in\r\nthe names, setting one in place of another, he utterly spoiled; besides\r\nwhich, his mode of delivery accorded very ill with the character of the\r\npersons and incidents: insomuch that Madonna Oretta, as she listened, did\r\noft sweat, and was like to faint, as if she were ill and at the point of\r\ndeath. And being at length able to bear no more of it, witting that the\r\ngentleman had got into a mess and was not like to get out of it, she said\r\npleasantly to him:--\"Sir, this horse of yours trots too hard; I pray you\r\nbe pleased to set me down.\" The gentleman, being perchance more quick of\r\napprehension than he was skilful in narration, missed not the meaning of\r\nher sally, and took it in all good and gay humour. So, leaving unfinished\r\nthe tale which he had begun, and so mishandled, he addressed himself to\r\ntell her other stories.\r\n\r\n(1) Cf. First Day, Novel X.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL II.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCisti, a baker, by an apt speech gives Messer Geri Spina to know that he\r\nhas by inadvertence asked that of him which he should not.\r\n--\r\n\r\nAll the ladies and the men alike having greatly commended Madonna\r\nOretta's apt saying, the queen bade Pampinea follow suit, and thus she\r\nbegan:--\r\n\r\nFair ladies, I cannot myself determine whether Nature or Fortune be the\r\nmore at fault, the one in furnishing a noble soul with a vile body, or\r\nthe other in allotting a base occupation to a body endowed with a noble\r\nsoul, whereof we may have seen an example, among others, in our\r\nfellow-citizen, Cisti; whom, furnished though he was with a most lofty\r\nsoul, Fortune made a baker. And verily I should curse Nature and Fortune\r\nalike, did I not know that Nature is most discreet, and that Fortune,\r\nalbeit the foolish imagine her blind, has a thousand eyes. For 'tis, I\r\nsuppose, that, being wise above a little, they do as mortals ofttimes do,\r\nwho, being uncertain as to their future, provide against contingencies by\r\nburying their most precious treasures in the basest places in their\r\nhouses, as being the least likely to be suspected; whence, in the hour of\r\ntheir greatest need, they bring them forth, the base place having kept\r\nthem more safe than the dainty chamber would have done. And so these two\r\narbitresses of the world not seldom hide their most precious commodities\r\nin the obscurity of the crafts that are reputed most base, that thence\r\nbeing brought to light they may shine with a brighter splendour. Whereof\r\nhow in a trifling matter Cisti, the baker, gave proof, restoring the eyes\r\nof the mind to Messer Geri Spina, whom the story of his wife, Madonna\r\nOretta, has brought to my recollection, I am minded to shew you in a\r\nnarrative which shall be of the briefest.\r\n\r\nI say then that Pope Boniface, with whom Messer Geri Spina stood very\r\nhigh in favour and honour, having sent divers of his courtiers to\r\nFlorence as ambassadors to treat of certain matters of great moment, and\r\nthey being lodged in Messer Geri's house, where he treated with them of\r\nthe said affairs of the Pope, 'twas, for some reason or another, the wont\r\nof Messer Geri and the ambassadors of the Pope to pass almost every\r\nmorning by Santa Maria Ughi, where Cisti, the baker, had his bakehouse,\r\nand plied his craft in person. Now, albeit Fortune had allotted him a\r\nvery humble occupation, she had nevertheless prospered him therein to\r\nsuch a degree that he was grown most wealthy, and without ever aspiring\r\nto change it for another, lived in most magnificent style, having among\r\nhis other good things a cellar of the best wines, white and red, that\r\nwere to be found in Florence, or the country parts; and marking Messer\r\nGeri and the ambassadors of the Pope pass every morning by his door, he\r\nbethought him that, as 'twas very hot, 'twould be a very courteous thing\r\nto give them to drink of his good wine; but comparing his rank with that\r\nof Messer Geri, he deemed it unseemly to presume to invite him, and cast\r\nabout how he might lead Messer Geri to invite himself. So, wearing always\r\nthe whitest of doublets and a spotless apron, that denoted rather the\r\nmiller, than the baker, he let bring, every morning about the hour that\r\nhe expected Messer Geri and the ambassadors to pass by his door, a\r\nspick-and-span bucket of fresh and cool spring water, and a small\r\nBolognese flagon of his good white wine, and two beakers that shone like\r\nsilver, so bright were they: and there down he sat him, as they came by,\r\nand after hawking once or twice, fell a drinking his wine with such gusto\r\nthat 'twould have raised a thirst in a corpse. Which Messer Geri having\r\nobserved on two successive mornings, said on the third:--\"What is't,\r\nCisti? Is't good?\" Whereupon Cisti jumped up, and answered:--\"Ay, Sir,\r\ngood it is; but in what degree I might by no means make you understand,\r\nunless you tasted it.\" Messer Geri, in whom either the heat of the\r\nweather, or unwonted fatigue, or, perchance, the gusto with which he had\r\nseen Cisti drink, had bred a thirst, turned to the ambassadors and said\r\nwith a smile:--\"Gentlemen, 'twere well to test the quality of this worthy\r\nman's wine: it may be such that we shall not repent us.\" And so in a body\r\nthey came up to where Cisti stood; who, having caused a goodly bench to\r\nbe brought out of the bakehouse, bade them be seated, and to their\r\nservants, who were now coming forward to wash the beakers, said:--\"Stand\r\nback, comrades, and leave this office to me, for I know as well how to\r\nserve wine as to bake bread; and expect not to taste a drop yourselves.\"\r\nWhich said, he washed four fine new beakers with his own hands, and\r\nhaving sent for a small flagon of his good wine, he heedfully filled the\r\nbeakers, and presented them to Messer Geri and his companions; who deemed\r\nthe wine the best that they had drunk for a great while. So Messer Geri,\r\nhaving praised the wine not a little, came there to drink every morning\r\nwith the ambassadors as long as they tarried with him.\r\n\r\nNow when the ambassadors had received their conge, and were about to\r\ndepart, Messer Geri gave a grand banquet, to which he bade some of the\r\nmost honourable of the citizens, and also Cisti, who could by no means be\r\ninduced to come. However, Messer Geri bade one of his servants go fetch a\r\nflask of Cisti's wine, and serve half a beaker thereof to each guest at\r\nthe first course. The servant, somewhat offended, perhaps, that he had\r\nnot been suffered to taste any of the wine, took with him a large flask,\r\nwhich Cisti no sooner saw, than:--\"Son,\" quoth he, \"Messer Geri does not\r\nsend thee to me\": and often as the servant affirmed that he did, he could\r\nget no other answer: wherewith he was fain at last to return to Messer\r\nGeri. \"Go, get thee back, said Messer Geri, and tell him that I do send\r\nthee to him, and if he answers thee so again, ask him, to whom then I\r\nsend thee.\" So the servant came back, and said:--\"Cisti, Messer Geri\r\ndoes, for sure, send me to thee.\" \"Son,\" answered Cisti, \"Messer Geri\r\ndoes, for sure, not send thee to me.\" \"To whom then,\" said the servant,\r\n\"does he send me?\" \"To Arno,\" returned Cisti. Which being reported by the\r\nservant to Messer Geri, the eyes of his mind were straightway opened,\r\nand:--\"Let me see,\" quoth he to the servant, \"what flask it is thou\r\ntakest there.\" And when he had seen it:--\"Cisti says sooth,\" he added;\r\nand having sharply chidden him, he caused him take with him a suitable\r\nflask, which when Cisti saw:--\"Now know I,\" quoth he, \"that 'tis indeed\r\nMesser Geri that sends thee to me,\" and blithely filled it. And having\r\nreplenished the rundlet that same day with wine of the same quality, he\r\nhad it carried with due care to Messer Geri's house, and followed after\r\nhimself; where finding Messer Geri he said:--\"I would not have you think,\r\nSir, that I was appalled by the great flask your servant brought me this\r\nmorning; 'twas but that I thought you had forgotten that which by my\r\nlittle beakers I gave you to understand, when you were with me of late;\r\nto wit, that this is no table wine; and so wished this morning to refresh\r\nyour memory. Now, however, being minded to keep the wine no longer, I\r\nhave sent you all I have of it, to be henceforth entirely at your\r\ndisposal.\" Messer Geri set great store by Cisti's gift, and thanked him\r\naccordingly, and ever made much of him and entreated him as his friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL III.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMonna Nonna de' Pulci by a ready retort silences the scarce seemly\r\njesting of the Bishop of Florence.\r\n--\r\n\r\nPampinea's story ended, and praise not a little bestowed on Cisti alike\r\nfor his apt speech and for his handsome present, the queen was pleased to\r\ncall forthwith for a story from Lauretta, who blithely thus began:--\r\n\r\nDebonair my ladies, the excellency of wit, and our lack thereof, have\r\nbeen noted with no small truth first by Pampinea and after her by\r\nFilomena. To which topic 'twere bootless to return: wherefore to that\r\nwhich has been said touching the nature of wit I purpose but to add one\r\nword, to remind you that its bite should be as a sheep's bite and not as\r\na dog's; for if it bite like a dog, 'tis no longer wit but discourtesy.\r\nWith which maxim the words of Madonna Oretta, and the apt reply of Cisti,\r\naccorded excellently. True indeed it is that if 'tis by way of retort,\r\nand one that has received a dog's bite gives the biter a like bite in\r\nreturn, it does not seem to be reprehensible, as otherwise it would have\r\nbeen. Wherefore one must consider how and when and on whom and likewise\r\nwhere one exercises one's wit. By ill observing which matters one of our\r\nprelates did once upon a time receive no less shrewd a bite than he gave;\r\nas I will shew you in a short story.\r\n\r\nWhile Messer Antonio d'Orso, a prelate both worthy and wise, was Bishop\r\nof Florence, there came thither a Catalan gentleman, Messer Dego della\r\nRatta by name, being King Ruberto's marshal. Now Dego being very goodly\r\nof person, and inordinately fond of women, it so befell that of the\r\nladies of Florence she that he regarded with especial favour was the very\r\nbeautiful niece of a brother of the said bishop. And having learned that\r\nher husband, though of good family, was but a caitiff, and avaricious in\r\nthe last degree, he struck a bargain with him that he should lie one\r\nnight with the lady for five hundred florins of gold: whereupon he had\r\nthe same number of popolins(1) of silver, which were then current,\r\ngilded, and having lain with the lady, albeit against her will, gave them\r\nto her husband. Which coming to be generally known, the caitiff husband\r\nwas left with the loss and the laugh against him; and the bishop, like a\r\nwise man, feigned to know nought of the affair. And so the bishop and the\r\nmarshal being much together, it befell that on St. John's day, as they\r\nrode side by side down the street whence they start to run the palio,(2)\r\nand took note of the ladies, the bishop espied a young gentlewoman, whom\r\nthis present pestilence has reft from us, Monna Nonna de' Pulci by name,\r\na cousin of Messer Alesso Rinucci, whom you all must know; whom, for that\r\nshe was lusty and fair, and of excellent discourse and a good courage,\r\nand but just settled with her husband in Porta San Piero, the bishop\r\npresented to the marshal; and then, being close beside her, he laid his\r\nhand on the marshal's shoulder and said to her:--\"Nonna, what thinkest\r\nthou of this gentleman? That thou mightst make a conquest of him?\" Which\r\nwords the lady resented as a jibe at her honour, and like to tarnish it\r\nin the eyes of those, who were not a few, in whose hearing they were\r\nspoken. Wherefore without bestowing a thought upon the vindication of her\r\nhonour, but being minded to return blow for blow, she retorted\r\nhastily:--\"Perchance, Sir, he might not make a conquest of me; but if he\r\ndid so, I should want good money.\" The answer stung both the marshal and\r\nthe bishop to the quick, the one as contriver of the scurvy trick played\r\nupon the bishop's brother in regard of his niece, the other as thereby\r\noutraged in the person of his brother's niece; insomuch that they dared\r\nnot look one another in the face, but took themselves off in shame and\r\nsilence, and said never a word more to her that day.\r\n\r\nIn such a case, then, the lady having received a bite, 'twas allowable in\r\nher wittily to return it.\r\n\r\n(1) A coin of the same size and design as the fiorino d'oro, but worth\r\nonly two soldi.\r\n\r\n(2) A sort of horse-race still in vogue at Siena.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IV.\r\n\r\n--\r\nChichibio, cook to Currado Gianfigliazzi, owes his safety to a ready\r\nanswer, whereby he converts Currado's wrath into laughter, and evades the\r\nevil fate with which Currado had threatened him.\r\n--\r\n\r\nLauretta being now silent, all lauded Nonna to the skies; after which\r\nNeifile received the queen's command to follow suit, and thus began:--\r\n\r\nAlbeit, loving ladies, ready wit not seldom ministers words apt and\r\nexcellent and congruous with the circumstances of the speakers, 'tis also\r\ntrue that Fortune at times comes to the aid of the timid, and\r\nunexpectedly sets words upon the tongue, which in a quiet hour the\r\nspeaker could never have found for himself: the which 'tis my purpose to\r\nshew you by my story.\r\n\r\nCurrado Gianfigliazzi, as the eyes and ears of each of you may bear\r\nwitness, has ever been a noble citizen of our city, open-handed and\r\nmagnificent, and one that lived as a gentleman should with hounds and\r\nhawks, in which, to say nothing at present of more important matters, he\r\nfound unfailing delight. Now, having one day hard by Peretola despatched\r\na crane with one of his falcons, finding it young and plump, he sent it\r\nto his excellent cook, a Venetian, Chichibio by name, bidding him roast\r\nit for supper and make a dainty dish of it. Chichibio, who looked, as he\r\nwas, a very green-head, had dressed the crane, and set it to the fire and\r\nwas cooking it carefully, when, the bird being all but roasted, and the\r\nfumes of the cooking very strong, it so chanced that a girl, Brunetta by\r\nname, that lived in the same street, and of whom Chichibio was greatly\r\nenamoured, came into the kitchen, and perceiving the smell and seeing the\r\nbird, began coaxing Chichibio to give her a thigh. By way of answer\r\nChichibio fell a singing:--\"You get it not from me, Madam Brunetta, you\r\nget it not from me.\" Whereat Madam Brunetta was offended, and said to\r\nhim:--\"By God, if thou givest it me not, thou shalt never have aught from\r\nme to pleasure thee.\" In short there was not a little altercation; and in\r\nthe end Chichibio, fain not to vex his mistress, cut off one of the\r\ncrane's thighs, and gave it to her. So the bird was set before Currado\r\nand some strangers that he had at table with him, and Currado, observing\r\nthat it had but one thigh, was surprised, and sent for Chichibio, and\r\ndemanded of him what was become of the missing thigh. Whereto the\r\nmendacious Venetian answered readily:--\"The crane, Sir, has but one thigh\r\nand one leg.\" \"What the devil?\" rejoined Currado in a rage: \"so the crane\r\nhas but one thigh and one leg? thinkst thou I never saw crane before\r\nthis?\" But Chichibio continued:--\"'Tis even so as I say, Sir; and, so\r\nplease you, I will shew you that so it is in the living bird.\" Currado\r\nhad too much respect for his guests to pursue the topic; he only\r\nsaid:--\"Since thou promisest to shew me in the living bird what I have\r\nnever seen or heard tell of, I bid thee do so to-morrow, and I shall be\r\nsatisfied, but if thou fail, I swear to thee by the body of Christ that I\r\nwill serve thee so that thou shalt ruefully remember my name for the rest\r\nof thy days.\"\r\n\r\nNo more was said of the matter that evening, but on the morrow, at\r\ndaybreak, Currado, who had by no means slept off his wrath, got up still\r\nswelling therewith, and ordered his horses, mounted Chichibio on a\r\nhackney, and saying to him:--\"We shall soon see which of us lied\r\nyesternight, thou or I,\" set off with him for a place where there was\r\nmuch water, beside which there were always cranes to be seen about dawn.\r\nChichibio, observing that Currado's ire was unabated, and knowing not how\r\nto bolster up his lie, rode by Currado's side in a state of the utmost\r\ntrepidation, and would gladly, had he been able, have taken to flight;\r\nbut, as he might not, he glanced, now ahead, now aback, now aside, and\r\nsaw everywhere nought but cranes standing on two feet. However, as they\r\napproached the river, the very first thing they saw upon the bank was a\r\nround dozen of cranes standing each and all on one foot, as is their\r\nwont, when asleep. Which Chichibio presently pointed out to Currado,\r\nsaying:--\"Now may you see well enough, Sir, that 'tis true as I said\r\nyesternight, that the crane has but one thigh and one leg; mark but how\r\nthey stand over there.\" Whereupon Currado:--\"Wait,\" quoth he, \"and I will\r\nshew thee that they have each thighs and legs twain.\" So, having drawn a\r\nlittle nigher to them, he ejaculated, \"Oho!\" Which caused the cranes to\r\nbring each the other foot to the ground, and, after hopping a step or\r\ntwo, to take to flight. Currado then turned to Chichibio, saying:--\"How\r\nnow, rogue? art satisfied that the bird has thighs and legs twain?\"\r\nWhereto Chichibio, all but beside himself with fear, made answer:--\"Ay,\r\nSir; but you cried not, oho! to our crane of yestereve: had you done so,\r\nit would have popped its other thigh and foot forth, as these have done.\"\r\nWhich answer Currado so much relished, that, all his wrath changed to\r\njollity and laughter:--\"Chichibio,\" quoth he, \"thou art right, indeed I\r\nought to have so done.\"\r\n\r\nThus did Chichibio by his ready and jocund retort arrest impending evil,\r\nand make his peace with his master.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL V.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMesser Forese da Rabatta and Master Giotto, the painter, journeying\r\ntogether from Mugello, deride one another's scurvy appearance.\r\n--\r\n\r\nNeifile being silent, and the ladies having made very merry over\r\nChichibio's retort, Pamfilo at the queen's command thus spoke:--Dearest\r\nladies, if Fortune, as Pampinea has shewn us, does sometimes bide\r\ntreasures most rich of native worth in the obscurity of base occupations,\r\nso in like manner 'tis not seldom found that Nature has enshrined\r\nprodigies of wit in the most ignoble of human forms. Whereof a notable\r\nexample is afforded by two of our citizens, of whom I purpose for a brief\r\nwhile to discourse. The one, Messer Forese da Rabatta by name, was short\r\nand deformed of person and withal flat-cheeked and flat-nosed, insomuch\r\nthat never a Baroncio(1) had a visage so misshapen but his would have\r\nshewed as hideous beside it; yet so conversant was this man with the\r\nlaws, that by not a few of those well able to form an opinion he was\r\nreputed a veritable storehouse of civil jurisprudence. The other, whose\r\nname was Giotto, was of so excellent a wit that, let Nature, mother of\r\nall, operant ever by continual revolution of the heavens, fashion what\r\nshe would, he with his style and pen and pencil would depict its like on\r\nsuch wise that it shewed not as its like, but rather as the thing itself,\r\ninsomuch that the visual sense of men did often err in regard thereof,\r\nmistaking for real that which was but painted. Wherefore, having brought\r\nback to light that art which had for many ages lain buried beneath the\r\nblunders of those who painted rather to delight the eyes of the ignorant\r\nthan to satisfy the intelligence of the wise, he may deservedly be called\r\none of the lights that compose the glory of Florence, and the more so,\r\nthe more lowly was the spirit in which he won that glory, who, albeit he\r\nwas, while he yet lived, the master of others, yet did ever refuse to be\r\ncalled their master. And this title that he rejected adorned him with a\r\nlustre the more splendid in proportion to the avidity with which it was\r\nusurped by those who were less knowing than he, or were his pupils. But\r\nfor all the exceeding greatness of his art, yet in no particular had he\r\nthe advantage of Messer Forese either in form or in feature. But to come\r\nto the story:--'Twas in Mugello that Messer Forese, as likewise Giotto,\r\nhad his country-seat, whence returning from a sojourn that he had made\r\nthere during the summer vacation of the courts, and being, as it chanced,\r\nmounted on a poor jade of a draught horse, he fell in with the said\r\nGiotto, who was also on his way back to Florence after a like sojourn on\r\nhis own estate, and was neither better mounted, nor in any other wise\r\nbetter equipped, than Messer Forese. And so, being both old men, they\r\njogged on together at a slow pace: and being surprised by a sudden\r\nshower, such as we frequently see fall in summer, they presently sought\r\nshelter in the house of a husbandman that was known to each of them, and\r\nwas their friend. But after a while, as the rain gave no sign of ceasing,\r\nand they had a mind to be at Florence that same day, they borrowed of the\r\nhusbandman two old cloaks of Romagnole cloth, and two hats much the worse\r\nfor age (there being no better to be had), and resumed their journey.\r\nWhereon they had not proceeded far, when, taking note that they were\r\nsoaked through and through, and liberally splashed with the mud cast up\r\nby their nags' hooves (circumstances which are not of a kind to add to\r\none's dignity), they, after long silence, the sky beginning to brighten a\r\nlittle, began to converse. And Messer Forese, as he rode and hearkened to\r\nGiotto, who was an excellent talker, surveyed him sideways, and from head\r\nto foot, and all over, and seeing him in all points in so sorry and\r\nscurvy a trim, and recking nought of his own appearance, broke into a\r\nlaugh and said:--\"Giotto, would e'er a stranger that met us, and had not\r\nseen thee before, believe, thinkst thou, that thou wert, as thou art,\r\nthe greatest painter in the world.\" Whereto Giotto answered\r\npromptly:--\"Methinks, Sir, he might, if, scanning you, he gave you credit\r\nfor knowing the A B C.\" Which hearing, Messer Forese recognized his\r\nerror, and perceived that he had gotten as good as he brought.\r\n\r\n(1) The name of a Florentine family famous for the extraordinary ugliness\r\nof its men: whereby it came to pass that any grotesque or extremely ugly\r\nman was called a Baroncio. Fanfani, Vocab. della Lingua Italiana, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VI.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMichele Scalza proves to certain young men that the Baronci are the best\r\ngentlemen in the world and the Maremma, and wins a supper.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe ladies were still laughing over Giotto's ready retort, when the queen\r\ncharged Fiammetta to follow suit; wherefore thus Fiammetta\r\nbegan:--Pamfilo's mention of the Baronci, who to you, Damsels, are\r\nperchance not so well known as to him, has brought to my mind a story in\r\nwhich 'tis shewn how great is their nobility; and, for that it involves\r\nno deviation from our rule of discourse, I am minded to tell it you.\r\n\r\n'Tis no long time since there dwelt in our city a young man, Michele\r\nScalza by name, the pleasantest and merriest fellow in the world, and the\r\nbest furnished with quaint stories: for which reason the Florentine youth\r\nset great store on having him with them when they forgathered in company.\r\nNow it so befell that one day, he being with a party of them at Mont'\r\nUghi, they fell a disputing together on this wise; to wit, who were the\r\nbest gentlemen and of the longest descent in Florence. One said, the\r\nUberti, another, the Lamberti, or some other family, according to the\r\npredilection of the speaker. Whereat Scalza began to smile, and\r\nsaid:--\"Now out upon you, out upon you, blockheads that ye are: ye know\r\nnot what ye say. The best gentlemen and of longest descent in all the\r\nworld and the Maremma (let alone Florence) are the Baronci by the common\r\nconsent of all phisopholers,(1) and all that know them as I do; and lest\r\nyou should otherwise conceive me, I say that 'tis of your neighbours the\r\nBaronci(2) of Santa Maria Maggiore that I speak.\" Whereupon the young\r\nmen, who had looked for somewhat else from him, said derisively:--\"Thou\r\ndost but jest with us; as if we did not know the Baronci as well as\r\nthou!\" Quoth Scalza:--\"By the Gospels I jest not, but speak sooth; and if\r\nthere is any of you will wager a supper to be given to the winner and six\r\ngood fellows whom he shall choose, I will gladly do the like, and--what\r\nis more--I will abide by the decision of such one of you as you may\r\nchoose.\" Then said one of them whose name was Neri Mannini:--\"I am ready\r\nto adventure this supper;\" and so they agreed together that Piero di\r\nFiorentino, in whose house they were, should be judge, and hied them to\r\nhim followed by all the rest, eager to see Scalza lose, and triumph in\r\nhis discomfiture, and told Piero all that had been said. Piero, who was a\r\nyoung man of sound sense, heard what Neri had to say; and then turning to\r\nScalza:--\"And how,\" quoth he, \"mayst thou make good what thou averrest?\"\r\n\"I will demonstrate it,\" returned Scalza, \"by reasoning so cogent that\r\nnot only you, but he that denies it shall acknowledge that I say sooth.\r\nYou know, and so they were saying but now, that the longer men's descent,\r\nthe better is their gentility, and I say that the Baronci are of longer\r\ndescent, and thus better gentlemen than any other men. If, then, I prove\r\nto you that they are of longer descent than any other men, without a\r\ndoubt the victory in this dispute will rest with me. Now you must know\r\nthat when God made the Baronci, He was but a novice in His art, of which,\r\nwhen He made the rest of mankind, He was already master. And to assure\r\nyourself that herein I say sooth, you have but to consider the Baronci,\r\nhow they differ from the rest of mankind, who all have faces well\r\ncomposed and duly proportioned, whereas of the Baronci you will see one\r\nwith a face very long and narrow, another with a face inordinately broad,\r\none with a very long nose, another with a short one, one with a\r\nprotruding and upturned chin, and great jaws like an ass's; and again\r\nthere will be one that has one eye larger than its fellow, or set on a\r\nlower plane; so that their faces resemble those that children make when\r\nthey begin to learn to draw. Whereby, as I said, 'tis plainly manifest\r\nthat, when God made them, He was but novice in His art; and so they are\r\nof longer descent than the rest of mankind, and by consequence better\r\ngentlemen.\" By which entertaining argument Piero, the judge, and Neri who\r\nhad wagered the supper, and all the rest, calling to mind the Baronci's\r\nugliness, were so tickled, that they fell a laughing, and averred that\r\nScalza was in the right, and that he had won the wager, and that without\r\na doubt the Baronci were the best gentlemen, and of the longest descent,\r\nnot merely in Florence, but in the world and the Maremma to boot.\r\nWherefore 'twas not without reason that Pamfilo, being minded to declare\r\nMesser Forese's ill-favouredness, said that he would have been hideous\r\nbeside a Baroncio.\r\n\r\n(1) In the Italian fisofoli: an evidently intentional distortion.\r\n\r\n(2) Villani, Istorie Fiorentine, iv. cap. ix., and Dante, Paradiso, xvi.\r\n104, spell the name Barucci.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMadonna Filippa, being found by her husband with her lover, is cited\r\nbefore the court, and by a ready and jocund answer acquits herself, and\r\nbrings about an alteration of the statute.\r\n--\r\n\r\nFiammetta had been silent some time, but Scalza's novel argument to prove\r\nthe pre-eminent nobility of the Baronci kept all still laughing, when the\r\nqueen called for a story from Filostrato, who thus began:--Noble ladies,\r\nan excellent thing is apt speech on all occasions, but to be proficient\r\ntherein I deem then most excellent when the occasion does most\r\nimperatively demand it. As was the case with a gentlewoman, of whom I\r\npurpose to speak to you, who not only ministered gaiety and merriment to\r\nher hearers, but extricated herself, as you shall hear, from the toils of\r\nan ignominious death.\r\n\r\nThere was aforetime in the city of Prato a statute no less censurable\r\nthan harsh, which, making no distinction between the wife whom her\r\nhusband took in adultery with her lover, and the woman found pleasuring a\r\nstranger for money, condemned both alike to be burned. While this statute\r\nwas in force, it befell that a gentlewoman, fair and beyond measure\r\nenamoured, Madonna Filippa by name, was by her husband, Rinaldo de'\r\nPugliesi, found in her own chamber one night in the arms of Lazzarino de'\r\nGuazzagliotri, a handsome young noble of the same city, whom she loved\r\neven as herself. Whereat Rinaldo, very wroth, scarce refrained from\r\nfalling upon them and killing them on the spot; and indeed, but that he\r\ndoubted how he should afterwards fare himself, he had given way to the\r\nvehemence of his anger, and so done. Nor, though he so far mastered\r\nhimself, could he forbear recourse to the statute, thereby to compass\r\nthat which he might not otherwise lawfully compass, to wit, the death of\r\nhis lady. Wherefore, having all the evidence needful to prove her guilt,\r\nhe took no further counsel; but, as soon as 'twas day, he charged the\r\nlady and had her summoned. Like most ladies that are veritably enamoured,\r\nthe lady was of a high courage; and, though not a few of her friends and\r\nkinsfolk sought to dissuade her, she resolved to appear to the summons,\r\nhaving liefer die bravely confessing the truth than basely flee and for\r\ndefiance of the law live in exile, and shew herself unworthy of such a\r\nlover as had had her in his arms that night. And so, attended by many\r\nladies and gentlemen, who all exhorted her to deny the charge, she came\r\nbefore the Podesta, and with a composed air and unfaltering voice asked\r\nwhereof he would interrogate her. The Podesta, surveying her, and taking\r\nnote of her extraordinary beauty, and exquisite manners, and the high\r\ncourage that her words evinced, was touched with compassion for her,\r\nfearing she might make some admission, by reason whereof, to save his\r\nhonour, he must needs do her to death. But still, as he could not refrain\r\nfrom examining her of that which was laid to her charge, he\r\nsaid:--\"Madam, here, as you see, is your husband, Rinaldo, who prefers a\r\ncharge against you, alleging that he has taken you in adultery, and so he\r\ndemands that, pursuant to a statute which is in force here, I punish you\r\nwith death: but this I may not do, except you confess; wherefore be very\r\ncareful what you answer, and tell me if what your husband alleges against\r\nyou be true.\" The lady, no wise dismayed, and in a tone not a little\r\njocund, thus made answer:--\"True it is, Sir, that Rinaldo is my husband,\r\nand that last night he found me in the arms of Lazzarino, in whose arms\r\nfor the whole-hearted love that I bear him I have ofttimes lain; nor\r\nshall I ever deny it; but, as well I wot you know, the laws ought to be\r\ncommon and enacted with the common consent of all that they affect; which\r\nconditions are wanting to this law, inasmuch as it binds only us poor\r\nwomen, in whom to be liberal is much less reprehensible than it were in\r\nmen; and furthermore the consent of no woman was--I say not had, but--so\r\nmuch as asked before 'twas made; for which reasons it justly deserves to\r\nbe called a bad law. However, if in scathe of my body and your own soul,\r\nyou are minded to put it in force, 'tis your affair; but, I pray you, go\r\nnot on to try this matter in any wise, until you have granted me this\r\ntrifling grace, to wit, to ask my husband if I ever gainsaid him, but did\r\nnot rather accord him, when and so often as he craved it, complete\r\nenjoyment of myself.\" Whereto Rinaldo, without awaiting the Podesta's\r\nquestion, forthwith answered, that assuredly the lady had ever granted\r\nhim all that he had asked of her for his gratification. \"Then,\" promptly\r\ncontinued the lady, \"if he has ever had of me as much as sufficed for his\r\nsolace, what was I or am I to do with the surplus? Am I to cast it to the\r\ndogs? Is it not much better to bestow it on a gentleman that loves me\r\nmore dearly than himself, than to suffer it to come to nought or worse?\"\r\nWhich jocund question being heard by well-nigh all the folk of Prato, who\r\nhad flocked thither all agog to see a dame so fair and of such quality on\r\nher trial for such an offence, they laughed loud and long, and then all\r\nwith one accord, and as with one voice, exclaimed that the lady was in\r\nthe right and said well; nor left they the court until in concert with\r\nthe Podesta they had so altered the harsh statute as that thenceforth\r\nonly such women as should wrong their husbands for money should be within\r\nits purview.\r\n\r\nWherefore Rinaldo left the court, discomfited of his foolish enterprise;\r\nand the lady blithe and free, as if rendered back to life from the\r\nburning, went home triumphant.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VIII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nFresco admonishes his niece not to look at herself in the glass, if 'tis,\r\nas she says, grievous to her to see nasty folk.\r\n--\r\n\r\n'Twas not at first without some flutterings of shame, evinced by the\r\nmodest blush mantling on their cheeks, that the ladies heard Filostrato's\r\nstory; but afterwards, exchanging glances, they could scarce forbear to\r\nlaugh, and hearkened tittering. However, when he had done, the queen\r\nturning to Emilia bade her follow suit. Whereupon Emilia, fetching a deep\r\nbreath as if she were roused from sleep, thus began:--Loving ladies,\r\nbrooding thought has kept my spirit for so long time remote from here\r\nthat perchance I may make a shift to satisfy our queen with a much\r\nshorter story than would have been forthcoming but for my absence of\r\nmind, wherein I purpose to tell you how a young woman's folly was\r\ncorrected by her uncle with a pleasant jest, had she but had the sense to\r\napprehend it. My story, then, is of one, Fresco da Celatico by name, that\r\nhad a niece, Ciesca, as she was playfully called, who, being fair of face\r\nand person, albeit she had none of those angelical charms that we\r\nofttimes see, had so superlative a conceit of herself, that she had\r\ncontracted a habit of disparaging both men and women and all that she\r\nsaw, entirely regardless of her own defects, though for odiousness,\r\ntiresomeness, and petulance she had not her match among women, insomuch\r\nthat there was nought that could be done to her mind: besides which, such\r\nwas her pride that had she been of the blood royal of France, 'twould\r\nhave been inordinate. And when she walked abroad, so fastidious was her\r\nhumour, she was ever averting her head, as if there was never a soul she\r\nsaw or met but reeked with a foul smell. Now one day--not to speak of\r\nother odious and tiresome ways that she had--it so befell that being come\r\nhome, where Fresco was, she sat herself down beside him with a most\r\nlanguishing air, and did nought but fume and chafe. Whereupon:--\"Ciesca,\"\r\nquoth he, \"what means this, that, though 'tis a feast-day, yet thou art\r\ncome back so soon?\" She, all but dissolved with her vapourish humours,\r\nmade answer:--\"Why, the truth is, that I am come back early because\r\nnever, I believe, were there such odious and tiresome men and women in\r\nthis city as there are to-day. I cannot pass a soul in the street that I\r\nloathe not like ill-luck; and I believe there is not a woman in the world\r\nthat is so distressed by the sight of odious people as I am; and so I am\r\ncome home thus soon to avoid the sight of them.\" Whereupon Fresco, to,\r\nwhom his niece's bad manners were distasteful in the\r\nextreme:--\"Daughter,\" quoth he, \"if thou loathe odious folk as much as\r\nthou sayest, thou wert best, so thou wouldst live happy, never to look at\r\nthyself in the glass.\" But she, empty as a reed, albeit in her own\r\nconceit a match for Solomon in wisdom, was as far as any sheep from\r\napprehending the true sense of her uncle's jest; but answered that on the\r\ncontrary she was minded to look at herself in the glass like other women.\r\nAnd so she remained, and yet remains, hidebound in her folly.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IX.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGuido Cavalcanti by a quip meetly rebukes certain Florentine gentlemen\r\nwho had taken him at a disadvantage.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe queen, perceiving that Emilia had finished her story, and that none\r\nbut she, and he who had the privilege of speaking last, now remained to\r\ntell, began on this wise:--Albeit, debonair my ladies, you have\r\nforestalled me to-day of more than two of the stories, of which I had\r\nthought to tell one, yet one is still left me to recount, which carries\r\nat the close of it a quip of such a sort, that perhaps we have as yet\r\nheard nought so pregnant.\r\n\r\nYou are to know, then, that in former times there obtained in our city\r\ncustoms excellent and commendable not a few, whereof today not one is\r\nleft to us, thanks to the greed which, growing with the wealth of our\r\nfolk, has banished them all from among us. One of which customs was that\r\nin divers quarters of Florence the gentlemen that there resided would\r\nassemble together in companies of a limited number, taking care to\r\ninclude therein only such as might conveniently bear the expenses, and\r\nto-day one, another to-morrow, each in his turn for a day, would\r\nentertain the rest of the company; and so they would not seldom do honour\r\nto gentlemen from distant parts when they visited the city, and also to\r\ntheir fellow-citizens; and in like manner they would meet together at\r\nleast once a year all in the same trim, and on the most notable days\r\nwould ride together through the city, and now and again they would tilt\r\ntogether, more especially on the greater feasts, or when the city was\r\nrejoiced by tidings of victory or some other glad event. Among which\r\ncompanies was one of which Messer Betto Brunelleschi was the leading\r\nspirit, into which Messer Betto and his comrades had striven hard to\r\nbring Guido, son of Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti, and not without reason,\r\ninasmuch as, besides being one of the best logicians in the world, and an\r\nexcellent natural philosopher (qualities of which the company made no\r\ngreat account), he was without a peer for gallantry and courtesy and\r\nexcellence of discourse and aptitude for all matters which he might set\r\nhis mind to, and that belonged to a gentleman; and therewithal he was\r\nvery rich, and, when he deemed any worthy of honour, knew how to bestow\r\nit to the uttermost. But, as Messer Betto had never been able to gain him\r\nover, he and his comrades supposed that 'twas because Guido, being\r\naddicted to speculation, was thereby estranged from men. And, for that he\r\nwas somewhat inclined to the opinion of the Epicureans, the vulgar\r\naverred that these speculations of his had no other scope than to prove\r\nthat God did not exist. Now one day it so befell that, Guido being come,\r\nas was not seldom his wont, from Or San Michele by the Corso degli\r\nAdimari as far as San Giovanni, around which were then the great tombs of\r\nmarble that are to-day in Santa Reparata, besides other tombs not a few,\r\nand Guido being between the columns of porphyry, that are there, and the\r\ntombs and the door of San Giovanni, which was locked, Messer Betto and\r\nhis company came riding on to the piazza of Santa Reparata, and seeing\r\nhim among the tombs, said:--\"Go we and flout him.\" So they set spurs to\r\ntheir horses, and making a mock onset, were upon him almost before he saw\r\nthem. Whereupon:--\"Guido,\" they began, \"thou wilt be none of our company;\r\nbut, lo now, when thou hast proved that God does not exist, what wilt\r\nthou have achieved?\" Guido, seeing that he was surrounded, presently\r\nanswered:--\"Gentlemen, you may say to me what you please in your own\r\nhouse.\" Thereupon he laid his hand on one of the great tombs, and being\r\nvery nimble, vaulted over it, and so evaded them, and went his way, while\r\nthey remained gazing in one another's faces, and some said that he had\r\ntaken leave of his wits, and that his answer was but nought, seeing that\r\nthe ground on which they stood was common to them with the rest of the\r\ncitizens, and among them Guido himself. But Messer Betto, turning to\r\nthem:--\"Nay but,\" quoth he, \"'tis ye that have taken leave of your wits,\r\nif ye have not understood him; for meetly and in few words he has given\r\nus never so shrewd a reprimand; seeing that, if you consider it well,\r\nthese tombs are the houses of the dead, that are laid and tarry therein;\r\nwhich he calls our house, to shew us that we, and all other simple,\r\nunlettered men, are, in comparison of him and the rest of the learned, in\r\nsorrier case than dead men, and so being here, we are in our own house.\"\r\nThen none was there but understood Guido's meaning and was abashed,\r\ninsomuch that they flouted him no more, and thenceforth reputed Messer\r\nBetto a gentleman of a subtle and discerning wit.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL X.\r\n\r\n--\r\nFra Cipolla promises to shew certain country-folk a feather of the Angel\r\nGabriel, in lieu of which he finds coals, which he avers to be of those\r\nwith which St. Lawrence was roasted.\r\n--\r\n\r\nAll the company save Dioneo being delivered of their several stories, he\r\nwist that 'twas his turn to speak. Wherefore, without awaiting any very\r\nexpress command, he enjoined silence on those that were commending\r\nGuido's pithy quip, and thus began:--Sweet my ladies, albeit 'tis my\r\nprivilege to speak of what likes me most, I purpose not to-day to deviate\r\nfrom that theme whereon you have all discoursed most appositely; but,\r\nfollowing in your footsteps, I am minded to shew you with what adroitness\r\nand readiness of resource one of the Friars of St. Antony avoided a\r\npickle that two young men had in readiness for him. Nor, if, in order to\r\ndo the story full justice, I be somewhat prolix of speech, should it be\r\nburdensome to you, if you will but glance at the sun, which is yet in\r\nmid-heaven.\r\n\r\nCertaldo, as perchance you may have heard, is a town of Val d'Elsa within\r\nour country-side, which, small though it is, had in it aforetime people\r\nof rank and wealth. Thither, for that there he found good pasture, 'twas\r\nlong the wont of one of the Friars of St. Antony to resort once every\r\nyear, to collect the alms that fools gave them. Fra Cipolla(1)--so hight\r\nthe friar--met with a hearty welcome, no less, perchance, by reason of\r\nhis name than for other cause, the onions produced in that district being\r\nfamous throughout Tuscany. He was little of person, red-haired,\r\njolly-visaged, and the very best of good fellows; and therewithal, though\r\nlearning he had none, he was so excellent and ready a speaker that whoso\r\nknew him not would not only have esteemed him a great rhetorician, but\r\nwould have pronounced him Tully himself or, perchance, Quintilian; and in\r\nall the country-side there was scarce a soul to whom he was not either\r\ngossip or friend or lover. Being thus wont from time to time to visit\r\nCertaldo, the friar came there once upon a time in the month of August,\r\nand on a Sunday morning, all the good folk of the neighbouring farms\r\nbeing come to mass in the parish church, he took occasion to come forward\r\nand say:--\"Ladies and gentlemen, you wot 'tis your custom to send year by\r\nyear to the poor of Baron Master St. Antony somewhat of your wheat and\r\noats, more or less, according to the ability and the devoutness of each,\r\nthat blessed St. Antony may save your oxen and asses and pigs and sheep\r\nfrom harm; and you are also accustomed, and especially those whose names\r\nare on the books of our confraternity, to pay your trifling annual dues.\r\nTo collect which offerings, I am hither sent by my superior, to wit,\r\nMaster Abbot; wherefore, with the blessing of God, after none, when you\r\nhear the bells ring, you will come out of the church to the place where\r\nin the usual way I shall deliver you my sermon, and you will kiss the\r\ncross; and therewithal, knowing, as I do, that you are one and all most\r\ndevoted to Baron Master St. Antony, I will by way of especial grace shew\r\nyou a most holy and goodly relic, which I brought myself from the Holy\r\nLand overseas, which is none other than one of the feathers of the Angel\r\nGabriel, which he left behind him in the room of the Virgin Mary, when he\r\ncame to make her the annunciation in Nazareth.\" And having said thus\r\nmuch, he ceased, and went on with the mass. Now among the many that were\r\nin the church, while Fra Cipolla made this speech, were two very wily\r\nyoung wags, the one Giovanni del Bragoniera by name, the other Biagio\r\nPizzini; who, albeit they were on the best of terms with Fra Cipolla and\r\nmuch in his company, had a sly laugh together over the relic, and\r\nresolved to make game of him and his feather. So, having learned that Fra\r\nCipolla was to breakfast that morning in the town with one of his\r\nfriends, as soon as they knew that he was at table, down they hied them\r\ninto the street, and to the inn where the friar lodged, having complotted\r\nthat Biagio should keep the friar's servant in play, while Giovanni made\r\nsearch among the friar's goods and chattels for this feather, whatever it\r\nmight be, to carry it off, that they might see how the friar would\r\nafterwards explain the matter to the people. Now Fra Cipolla had for\r\nservant one Guccio,(2) whom some called by way of addition Balena,(3)\r\nothers Imbratta,(4) others again Porco,(5) and who was such a rascallion\r\nthat sure it is that Lippo Topo(6) himself never painted his like.\r\nConcerning whom Fra Cipolla would ofttimes make merry with his familiars,\r\nsaying:--\"My servant has nine qualities, any one of which in Solomon,\r\nAristotle, or Seneca, would have been enough to spoil all their virtue,\r\nwisdom and holiness. Consider, then, what sort of a man he must be that\r\nhas these nine qualities, and yet never a spark of either virtue or\r\nwisdom or holiness.\" And being asked upon divers occasions what these\r\nnine qualities might be, he strung them together in rhyme, and\r\nanswered:--\"I will tell you. Lazy and uncleanly and a liar he is,\r\nNegligent, disobedient and foulmouthed, iwis, And reckless and witless\r\nand mannerless: and therewithal he has some other petty vices, which\r\n'twere best to pass over. And the most amusing thing about him is, that,\r\nwherever he goes, he is for taking a wife and renting a house, and on the\r\nstrength of a big, black, greasy beard he deems himself so very handsome\r\na fellow and seductive, that he takes all the women that see him to be in\r\nlove with him, and, if he were left alone, he would slip his girdle and\r\nrun after them all. True it is that he is of great use to me, for that,\r\nbe any minded to speak with me never so secretly, he must still have his\r\nshare of the audience; and, if perchance aught is demanded of me, such is\r\nhis fear lest I should be at a loss what answer to make, that he\r\npresently replies, ay or no, as he deems meet.\"\r\n\r\nNow, when he left this knave at the inn, Fra Cipolla had strictly\r\nenjoined him on no account to suffer any one to touch aught of his, and\r\nleast of all his wallet, because it contained the holy things. But Guccio\r\nImbratta, who was fonder of the kitchen than any nightingale of the green\r\nboughs, and most particularly if he espied there a maid, and in the\r\nhost's kitchen had caught sight of a coarse fat woman, short and\r\nmisshapen, with a pair of breasts that shewed as two buckets of muck and\r\na face that might have belonged to one of the Baronci, all reeking with\r\nsweat and grease and smoke, left Fra Cipolla's room and all his things to\r\ntake care of themselves, and like a vulture swooping down upon the\r\ncarrion, was in the kitchen in a trice. Where, though 'twas August, he\r\nsat him down by the fire, and fell a gossiping with Nuta--such was the\r\nmaid's name--and told her that he was a gentleman by procuration,(7) and\r\nhad more florins than could be reckoned, besides those that he had to\r\ngive away, which were rather more than less, and that he could do and say\r\nsuch things as never were or might be seen or heard forever, good Lord!\r\nand a day. And all heedless of his cowl, which had as much grease upon it\r\nas would have furnished forth the caldron of Altopascio,(8) and of his\r\nrent and patched doublet, inlaid with filth about the neck and under the\r\narmpits, and so stained that it shewed hues more various than ever did\r\nsilk from Tartary or the Indies, and of his shoes that were all to\r\npieces, and of his hose that were all in tatters, he told her in a tone\r\nthat would have become the Sieur de Chatillon, that he was minded to\r\nrehabit her and put her in trim, and raise her from her abject condition,\r\nand place her where, though she would not have much to call her own, at\r\nany rate she would have hope of better things, with much more to the like\r\neffect; which professions, though made with every appearance of good\r\nwill, proved, like most of his schemes, insubstantial as air, and came to\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nFinding Guccio Porco thus occupied with Nuta, the two young men gleefully\r\naccounted their work half done, and, none gainsaying them, entered Fra\r\nCipolla's room, which was open, and lit at once upon the wallet, in which\r\nwas the feather. The wallet opened, they found, wrapt up in many folds of\r\ntaffeta, a little casket, on opening which they discovered one of the\r\ntail-feathers of a parrot, which they deemed must be that which the friar\r\nhad promised to shew the good folk of Certaldo. And in sooth he might\r\nwell have so imposed upon them, for in those days the luxuries of Egypt\r\nhad scarce been introduced into Tuscany, though they have since been\r\nbrought over in prodigious abundance, to the grave hurt of all Italy. And\r\nthough some conversance with them there was, yet in those parts folk knew\r\nnext to nothing of them; but, adhering to the honest, simple ways of\r\ntheir forefathers, had not seen, nay for the most part had not so much as\r\nheard tell of, a parrot.\r\n\r\nSo the young men, having found the feather, took it out with great glee;\r\nand looking around for something to replace it, they espied in a corner\r\nof the room some pieces of coal, wherewith they filled the casket; which\r\nthey then closed, and having set the room in order exactly as they had\r\nfound it, they quitted it unperceived, and hied them merrily off with the\r\nfeather, and posted themselves where they might hear what Fra Cipolla\r\nwould say when he found the coals in its stead. Mass said, the simple\r\nfolk that were in the church went home with the tidings that the feather\r\nof the Angel Gabriel was to be seen after none; and this goodman telling\r\nhis neighbour, and that goodwife her gossip, by the time every one had\r\nbreakfasted, the town could scarce hold the multitude of men and women\r\nthat flocked thither all agog to see this feather.\r\n\r\nFra Cipolla, having made a hearty breakfast and had a little nap, got up\r\nshortly after none, and marking the great concourse of country-folk that\r\nwere come to see the feather, sent word to Guccio Imbratta to go up there\r\nwith the bells, and bring with him the wallet. Guccio, though 'twas with\r\ndifficulty that he tore himself away from the kitchen and Nuta, hied him\r\nup with the things required; and though, when he got up, he was winded,\r\nfor he was corpulent with drinking nought but water, he did Fra Cipolla's\r\nbidding by going to the church door and ringing the bells amain. When all\r\nthe people were gathered about the door, Fra Cipolla, all unwitting that\r\naught of his was missing, began his sermon, and after much said in\r\nglorification of himself, caused the confiteor to be recited with great\r\nsolemnity, and two torches to be lit by way of preliminary to the shewing\r\nof the feather of the Angel Gabriel: he then bared his head, carefully\r\nunfolded the taffeta, and took out the casket, which, after a few\r\nprefatory words in praise and laudation of the Angel Gabriel and his\r\nrelic, he opened. When he saw that it contained nought but coals, he did\r\nnot suspect Guccio Balena of playing the trick, for he knew that he was\r\nnot clever enough, nor did he curse him, that his carelessness had\r\nallowed another to play it, but he inly imprecated himself, that he had\r\ncommitted his things to the keeping of one whom he knew to be \"negligent\r\nand disobedient, reckless and witless.\" Nevertheless, he changed not\r\ncolour, but with face and hands upturned to heaven, he said in a voice\r\nthat all might hear:--\"O God, blessed be Thy might for ever and ever.\"\r\nThen, closing the casket, and turning to the people:--\"Ladies and\r\ngentlemen,\" he said, \"you are to know, that when I was yet a very young\r\nman, I was sent by my superior into those parts where the sun rises, and\r\nI was expressly bidden to search until I should find the Privileges of\r\nPorcellana, which, though they cost nothing to seal, are of much more use\r\nto others than to us. On which errand I set forth, taking my departure\r\nfrom Venice, and traversing the Borgo de' Greci,(9) and thence on\r\nhorseback the realm of Algarve,(10) and so by Baldacca(11) I came to\r\nParione,(12) whence, somewhat athirst, I after a while got on to\r\nSardinia.(13) But wherefore go I about to enumerate all the lands in\r\nwhich I pursued my quest? Having passed the straits of San Giorgio, I\r\narrived at Truffia(14) and Buffia,(15) countries thickly populated and\r\nwith great nations, whence I pursued my journey to Menzogna,(16) where I\r\nmet with many of our own brethren, and of other religious not a few,\r\nintent one and all on eschewing hardship for the love of God, making\r\nlittle account of others! toil, so they might ensue their own advantage,\r\nand paying in nought but unminted coin(17) throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of the country; and so I came to the land of Abruzzi, where the\r\nmen and women go in pattens on the mountains, and clothe the hogs with\r\ntheir own entrails;(18) and a little further on I found folk that carried\r\nbread in staves and wine in sacks.(19) And leaving them, I arrived at the\r\nmountains of the Bachi,(20) where all the waters run downwards. In short\r\nI penetrated so far that I came at last to India Pastinaca,(21) where I\r\nswear to you by the habit that I wear, that I saw pruning-hooks(22) fly:\r\na thing that none would believe that had not seen it. Whereof be my\r\nwitness that I lie not Maso del Saggio, that great merchant, whom I found\r\nthere cracking nuts, and selling the shells by retail! However, not being\r\nable to find that whereof I was in quest, because from thence one must\r\ntravel by water, I turned back, and so came at length to the Holy Land,\r\nwhere in summer cold bread costs four deniers, and hot bread is to be had\r\nfor nothing. And there I found the venerable father\r\nNonmiblasmetesevoipiace,(23) the most worshipful Patriarch of Jerusalem;\r\nwho out of respect for the habit that I have ever worn, to wit, that of\r\nBaron Master St. Antony, was pleased to let me see all the holy relics\r\nthat he had by him, which were so many, that, were I to enumerate them\r\nall, I should not come to the end of them in some miles. However, not to\r\ndisappoint you, I will tell you a few of them. In the first place, then,\r\nhe shewed me the finger of the Holy Spirit, as whole and entire as it\r\never was, and the tuft of the Seraph that appeared to St. Francis, and\r\none of the nails of the Cherubim, and one of the ribs of the Verbum Caro\r\nhie thee to the casement,(24) and some of the vestments of the Holy\r\nCatholic Faith, and some of the rays of the star that appeared to the\r\nMagi in the East, and a phial of the sweat of St. Michael a battling with\r\nthe Devil and the jaws of death of St. Lazarus, and other relics. And for\r\nthat I gave him a liberal supply of the acclivities(25) of Monte Morello\r\nin the vulgar and some chapters of Caprezio, of which he had long been in\r\nquest, he was pleased to let me participate in his holy relics, and gave\r\nme one of the teeth of the Holy Cross, and in a small phial a bit of the\r\nsound of the bells of Solomon's temple, and this feather of the Angel\r\nGabriel, whereof I have told you, and one of the pattens of San Gherardo\r\nda Villa Magna, which, not long ago, I gave at Florence to Gherardo di\r\nBonsi, who holds him in prodigious veneration. He also gave me some of\r\nthe coals with which the most blessed martyr, St. Lawrence, was roasted.\r\nAll which things I devoutly brought thence, and have them all safe. True\r\nit is that my superior has not hitherto permitted me to shew them, until\r\nhe should be certified that they are genuine. However, now that this is\r\navouched by certain miracles wrought by them, of which we have tidings by\r\nletter from the Patriarch, he has given me leave to shew them. But,\r\nfearing to trust them to another, I always carry them with me; and to\r\ntell you the truth I carry the feather of the Angel Gabriel, lest it\r\nshould get spoiled, in a casket, and the coals, with which St. Lawrence\r\nwas roasted, in another casket; which caskets are so like the one to the\r\nother, that not seldom I mistake one for the other, which has befallen me\r\non this occasion; for, whereas I thought to have brought with me the\r\ncasket wherein is the feather, I have brought instead that which contains\r\nthe coals. Nor deem I this a mischance; nay, methinks, 'tis by\r\ninterposition, of God, and that He Himself put the casket of coals in my\r\nhand, for I mind me that the feast of St. Lawrence falls but two days\r\nhence. Wherefore God, being minded that by shewing you the coals, with\r\nwhich he was roasted, I should rekindle in your souls the devotion that\r\nyou ought to feel towards him, guided my hand, not to the feather which I\r\nmeant to take, but to the blessed coals that were extinguished by the\r\nhumours that exuded from that most holy body. And so, blessed children,\r\nbare your heads and devoutly draw nigh to see them. But first of all I\r\nwould have you know, that whoso has the sign of the cross made upon him\r\nwith these coals, may live secure for the whole of the ensuing year, that\r\nfire shall not touch him, that he feel it not.\"\r\n\r\nHaving so said, the friar, chanting a hymn in praise of St. Lawrence,\r\nopened the casket, and shewed the coals. Whereon the foolish crowd gazed\r\na while in awe and reverent wonder, and then came pressing forward in a\r\nmighty throng about Fra Cipolla with offerings beyond their wont, each\r\nand all praying him to touch them with the coals. Wherefore Fra Cipolla\r\ntook the coals in his hand, and set about making on their white blouses,\r\nand on their doublets, and on the veils of the women crosses as big as\r\nmight be, averring the while that whatever the coals might thus lose\r\nwould be made good to them again in the casket, as he had often proved.\r\nOn this wise, to his exceeding great profit, he marked all the folk of\r\nCertaldo with the cross, and, thanks to his ready wit and resource, had\r\nhis laugh at those, who by robbing him of the feather thought to make a\r\nlaughing-stock of him. They, indeed, being among his hearers, and marking\r\nhis novel expedient, and how voluble he was, and what a long story he\r\nmade of it, laughed till they thought their jaws would break; and, when\r\nthe congregation was dispersed, they went up to him, and never so merrily\r\ntold him what they had done, and returned him his feather; which next\r\nyear proved no less lucrative to him than that day the coals had been.\r\n\r\n(1) Onion.\r\n\r\n(2) Diminutive of Arriguccio.\r\n\r\n(3) Whale.\r\n\r\n(4) Filth.\r\n\r\n(5) Hog.\r\n\r\n(6) The works of this painter seem to be lost.\r\n\r\n(7) One of the humorous ineptitudes of which Boccaccio is fond.\r\n\r\n(8) An abbey near Lucca famous for its doles of broth.\r\n\r\n(9) Perhaps part of the \"sesto\" of Florence known as the Borgo, as the\r\ntradition of the commentators that the friar's itinerary is wholly\r\nFlorentine is not to be lightly set aside.\r\n\r\n(10) Il Garbo, a quarter or street in Florence, doubtless so called\r\nbecause the wares of Algarve were there sold.

Be thou\r\nking then; and let thy rule be such that, when 'tis ended, we may have\r\ncause to commend it.\" Dioneo took the crown, and laughingly\r\nanswered:--\"Kings worthier far than I you may well have seen many a time\r\nere now--I speak of the kings in chess; but let me have of you that\r\nobedience which is due to a true king, and of a surety I will give you to\r\ntaste of that solace, without which perfection of joy there may not be in\r\nany festivity. But enough of this: I will govern as best I may.\" Then, as\r\nwas the wont, he sent for the seneschal, and gave him particular\r\ninstruction how to order matters during the term of his sovereignty;\r\nwhich done, he said:--\"Noble ladies, such and so diverse has been our\r\ndiscourse of the ways of men and their various fortunes, that but for the\r\nvisit that we had a while ago from Madam Licisca, who by what she said\r\nhas furnished me with matter of discourse for to-morrow, I doubt I had\r\nbeen not a little put to it to find a theme. You heard how she said that\r\nthere was not a woman in her neighbourhood whose husband had her\r\nvirginity; adding that well she knew how many and what manner of tricks\r\nthey, after marriage, played their husbands. The first count we may well\r\nleave to the girls whom it concerns; the second, methinks, should prove a\r\ndiverting topic: wherefore I ordain that, taking our cue from Madam\r\nLicisca, we discourse to-morrow of the tricks that, either for love or\r\nfor their deliverance from peril, ladies have heretofore played their\r\nhusbands, and whether they were by the said husbands detected or no.\" To\r\ndiscourse of such a topic some of the ladies deemed unmeet for them, and\r\nbesought the king to find another theme. But the king made\r\nanswer:--\"Ladies, what manner of theme I have prescribed I know as well\r\nas you, nor was I to be diverted from prescribing it by that which you\r\nnow think to declare unto me, for I wot the times are such that, so only\r\nmen and women have a care to do nought that is unseemly, 'tis allowable\r\nto them to discourse of what they please. For in sooth, as you must know,\r\nso out of joint are the times that the judges have deserted the\r\njudgment-seat, the laws are silent, and ample licence to preserve his\r\nlife as best he may is accorded to each and all. Wherefore, if you are\r\nsomewhat less strict of speech than is your wont, not that aught unseemly\r\nin act may follow, but that you may afford solace to yourselves and\r\nothers, I see not how you can be open to reasonable censure on the part\r\nof any. Furthermore, nought that has been said from the first day to the\r\npresent moment has, methinks, in any degree sullied the immaculate honour\r\nof your company, nor, God helping us, shall aught ever sully it. Besides,\r\nwho is there that knows not the quality of your honour? which were proof,\r\nI make no doubt, against not only the seductive influence of diverting\r\ndiscourse, but even the terror of death. And, to tell you the truth,\r\nwhoso wist that you refused to discourse of these light matters for a\r\nwhile, would be apt to suspect that 'twas but for that you had yourselves\r\nerred in like sort. And truly a goodly honour would you confer upon me,\r\nobedient as I have ever been to you, if after making me your king and\r\nyour lawgiver, you were to refuse to discourse of the theme which I\r\nprescribe. Away, then, with this scruple fitter for low minds than yours,\r\nand let each study how she may give us a goodly story, and Fortune\r\nprosper her therein.\"\r\n\r\nSo spake the king, and the ladies, hearkening, said that, even as he\r\nwould, so it should be: whereupon he gave all leave to do as they might\r\nbe severally minded until the supper-hour. The sun was still quite high\r\nin the heaven, for they had not enlarged in their discourse: wherefore,\r\nDioneo with the other gallants being set to play at dice, Elisa called\r\nthe other ladies apart, and said:--\"There is a nook hard by this place,\r\nwhere I think none of you has ever been: 'tis called the Ladies' Vale:\r\nwhither, ever since we have been here, I have desired to take you, but\r\ntime meet I have not found until today, when the sun is still so high:\r\nif, then, you are minded to visit it, I have no manner of doubt that,\r\nwhen you are there, you will be very glad you came.\" The ladies answered\r\nthat they were ready, and so, saying nought to the young men, they\r\nsummoned one of their maids, and set forth; nor had they gone much more\r\nthan a mile, when they arrived at the Vale of Ladies. They entered it by\r\na very strait gorge, through which there issued a rivulet, clear as\r\ncrystal, and a sight, than which nought more fair and pleasant,\r\nespecially at that time when the heat was great, could be imagined, met\r\ntheir eyes. Within the valley, as one of them afterwards told me, was a\r\nplain about half-a-mile in circumference, and so exactly circular that it\r\nmight have been fashioned according to the compass, though it seemed a\r\nwork of Nature's art, not man's: 'twas girdled about by six hills of no\r\ngreat height, each crowned with a palace that shewed as a goodly little\r\ncastle. The slopes of the hills were graduated from summit to base after\r\nthe manner of the successive tiers, ever abridging their circle, that we\r\nsee in our theatres; and as many as fronted the southern rays were all\r\nplanted so close with vines, olives, almond-trees, cherry-trees,\r\nfig-trees and other fruitbearing trees not a few, that there was not a\r\nhand's-breadth of vacant space. Those that fronted the north were in like\r\nmanner covered with copses of oak saplings, ashes and other trees, as\r\ngreen and straight as might be. Besides which, the plain, which was shut\r\nin on all sides save that on which the ladies had entered, was full of\r\nfirs, cypresses, and bay-trees, with here and there a pine, in order and\r\nsymmetry so meet and excellent as had they been planted by an artist, the\r\nbest that might be found in that kind; wherethrough, even when the sun\r\nwas in the zenith, scarce a ray of light might reach the ground, which\r\nwas all one lawn of the finest turf, pranked with the hyacinth and divers\r\nother flowers. Add to which--nor was there aught there more\r\ndelightsome--a rivulet that, issuing from one of the gorges between two\r\nof the hills, descended over ledges of living rock, making, as it fell, a\r\nmurmur most gratifying to the ear, and, seen from a distance, shewed as a\r\nspray of finest, powdered quick-silver, and no sooner reached the little\r\nplain, than 'twas gathered into a tiny channel, by which it sped with\r\ngreat velocity to the middle of the plain, where it formed a diminutive\r\nlake, like the fishponds that townsfolk sometimes make in their gardens,\r\nwhen they have occasion for them. The lake was not so deep but that a man\r\nmight stand therein with his breast above the water; and so clear, so\r\npellucid was the water that the bottom, which was of the finest gravel,\r\nshewed so distinct, that one, had he wished, who had nought better to do,\r\nmight have counted the stones. Nor was it only the bottom that was to be\r\nseen, but such a multitude of fishes, glancing to and fro, as was at once\r\na delight and a marvel to behold. Bank it had none, but its margin was\r\nthe lawn, to which it imparted a goodlier freshness. So much of the water\r\nas it might not contain was received by another tiny channel, through\r\nwhich, issuing from the vale, it glided swiftly to the plain below.\r\n\r\nTo which pleasaunce the damsels being come surveyed it with roving\r\nglance, and finding it commendable, and marking the lake in front of\r\nthem, did, as 'twas very hot, and they deemed themselves secure from\r\nobservation, resolve to take a bath. So, having bidden their maid wait\r\nand keep watch over the access to the vale, and give them warning, if\r\nhaply any should approach it, they all seven undressed and got into the\r\nwater, which to the whiteness of their flesh was even such a veil as fine\r\nglass is to the vermeil of the rose. They, being thus in the water, the\r\nclearness of which was thereby in no wise affected, did presently begin\r\nto go hither and thither after the fish, which had much ado where to\r\nbestow themselves so as to escape out of their hands. In which diversion\r\nthey spent some time, and caught a few, and then they hied them out of\r\nthe water and dressed them again, and bethinking them that 'twas time to\r\nreturn to the palace, they began slowly sauntering thither, dilating much\r\nas they went upon the beauty of the place, albeit they could not extol it\r\nmore than they had already done. 'Twas still quite early when they\r\nreached the palace, so that they found the gallants yet at play where\r\nthey had left them. To whom quoth Pampinea with a smile:--\"We have stolen\r\na march upon you to-day.\" \"So,\" replied Dioneo, \"'tis with you do first\r\nand say after?\" \"Ay, my lord,\" returned Pampinea, and told him at large\r\nwhence they came, and what the place was like, and how far 'twas off, and\r\nwhat they had done. What she said of the beauty of the spot begat in the\r\nking a desire to see it: wherefore he straightway ordered supper, whereof\r\nwhen all had gaily partaken, the three gallants parted from the ladies\r\nand hied them with their servants to the vale, where none of them had\r\never been before, and, having marked all its beauties, extolled it as\r\nscarce to be matched in all the world. Then, as the hour was very late,\r\nthey did but bathe, and as soon as they had resumed their clothes,\r\nreturned to the ladies, whom they found dancing a carol to an air that\r\nFiammetta sang, which done, they conversed of the Ladies' Vale, waxing\r\neloquent in praise thereof: insomuch that the king called the seneschal,\r\nand bade him have some beds made ready and carried thither on the morrow,\r\nthat any that were so minded might there take their siesta. He then had\r\nlights and wine and comfits brought; and when they had taken a slight\r\nrefection, he bade all address them to the dance. So at his behest\r\nPamfilo led a dance, and then the king, turning with gracious mien to\r\nElisa:--\"Fair damsel,\" quoth he, \"'twas thou to-day didst me this honour\r\nof the crown; and 'tis my will that thine to-night be the honour of the\r\nsong; wherefore sing us whatsoever thou hast most lief.\" \"That gladly\r\nwill I,\" replied Elisa smiling; and thus with dulcet voice began:--\r\n\r\nIf of thy talons, Love, be quit I may,\r\n  I deem it scarce can be\r\n  But other fangs I may elude for aye.\r\n\r\nService I took with thee, a tender maid,\r\n  In thy war thinking perfect peace to find,\r\n  And all my arms upon the ground I laid,\r\n  Yielding myself to thee with trustful mind:\r\n  Thou, harpy-tyrant, whom no faith may bind,\r\n  Eftsoons didst swoop on me,\r\n  And with thy cruel claws mad'st me thy prey.\r\n\r\nThen thy poor captive, bound with many a chain,\r\n  Thou tookst, and gav'st to him, whom fate did call\r\n  Hither my death to be; for that in pain\r\n  And bitter tears I waste away, his thrall:\r\n  Nor heave I e'er a sigh, or tear let fall,\r\n  So harsh a lord is he,\r\n  That him inclines a jot my grief to allay.\r\n\r\nMy prayers upon the idle air are spent:\r\n  He hears not, will not hear; wherefore in vain\r\n  The more each hour my soul doth her torment;\r\n  Nor may I die, albeit to die were gain.\r\n  Ah! Lord, have pity of my bitter pain!\r\n  Help have I none but thee;\r\n  Then take and bind and at my feet him lay.\r\n\r\nBut if thou wilt not, do my soul but loose\r\n  From hope, that her still binds with triple chain.\r\n  Sure, O my Lord, this prayer thou'lt not refuse:\r\n  The which so thou to grant me do but deign,\r\n  I look my wonted beauty to regain,\r\n  And banish misery\r\n  With roses white and red bedecked and gay.\r\n\r\nSo with a most piteous sigh ended Elisa her song, whereat all wondered\r\nexceedingly, nor might any conjecture wherefore she so sang. But the\r\nking, who was in a jolly humour, sent for Tindaro, and bade him out with\r\nhis cornemuse, and caused them tread many a measure thereto, until, no\r\nsmall part of the night being thus spent, he gave leave to all to betake\r\nthem to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nEndeth here the sixth day of the Decameron, beginneth the seventh, in\r\nwhich, under the rule of Dioneo, discourse is had of the tricks which,\r\neither for love or for their deliverance from peril, ladies have\r\nheretofore played their husbands, and whether they were by the said\r\nhusbands detected, or no.\r\n--\r\n\r\nFled was now each star from the eastern sky, save only that which we call\r\nLucifer, which still glowed in the whitening dawn, when uprose the\r\nseneschal, and with a goodly baggage-train hied him to the Ladies' Vale,\r\nthere to make all things ready according to the ordinance and commandment\r\nof the king. Nor was it long after his departure that the king rose,\r\nbeing awaked by the stir and bustle that the servants made in lading the\r\nhorses, and being risen he likewise roused all the ladies and the other\r\ngallants; and so, when as yet 'twas scarce clear daybreak, they all took\r\nthe road; nor seemed it to them that the nightingales and the other birds\r\nhad ever chanted so blithely as that morning. By which choir they were\r\nattended to the Ladies' Vale, where they were greeted by other warblers\r\nnot a few, that seemed rejoiced at their arrival. Roving about the vale,\r\nand surveying its beauties afresh, they rated them higher than on the\r\nprevious day, as indeed the hour was more apt to shew them forth. Then\r\nwith good wine and comfits they broke their fast, and, that they might\r\nnot lag behind the songsters, they fell a singing, whereto the vale\r\nresponded, ever echoing their strains; nor did the birds, as minded not\r\nto be beaten, fail to swell the chorus with notes of unwonted sweetness.\r\nHowever, breakfast-time came, and then, the tables being laid under a\r\nliving canopy of trees, and beside other goodly trees that fringed the\r\nlittle lake, they sat them down in order as to the king seemed meet. So\r\nthey took their meal, glancing from time to time at the lake, where the\r\nfish darted to and fro in multitudinous shoals, which afforded not only\r\ndelight to their eyes but matter for converse. Breakfast ended, and the\r\ntables removed, they fell a singing again more blithely than before.\r\nAfter which, there being set, in divers places about the little vale,\r\nbeds which the discreet seneschal had duly furnished and equipped within\r\nand without with store of French coverlets, and other bedgear, all, that\r\nwere so minded, had leave of the king to go to sleep, and those that\r\ncared not to sleep might betake them, as each might choose, to any of\r\ntheir wonted diversions. But, all at length being risen, and the time for\r\naddressing them to the story-telling being come, the king had carpets\r\nspread on the sward no great way from the place where they had\r\nbreakfasted; and, all having sat them down beside the lake, he bade\r\nEmilia begin; which, blithe and smiling, Emilia did on this wise.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL I.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGianni Lotteringhi hears a knocking at his door at night: he awakens his\r\nwife, who persuades him that 'tis the bogey, which they fall to\r\nexorcising with a prayer; whereupon the knocking ceases.\r\n--\r\n\r\nMy lord, glad indeed had I been, that, saving your good pleasure, some\r\nother than I had had precedence of discourse upon so goodly a theme as\r\nthis of which we are to speak--I doubt I am but chosen to teach others\r\nconfidence; but, such being your will, I will gladly obey it. And my\r\nendeavour shall be, dearest ladies, to tell you somewhat that may be\r\nserviceable to you in the future: for, if you are, as I am, timorous, and\r\nthat most especially of the bogey, which, God wot, I know not what manner\r\nof thing it may be, nor yet have found any that knew, albeit we are all\r\nalike afraid of it, you may learn from this my story how to put it to\r\nflight, should it intrude upon you, with a holy, salutary and most\r\nefficacious orison.\r\n\r\nThere dwelt of yore at Florence, in the quarter of San Pancrazio, a\r\nmaster-spinner, Gianni Lotteringhi by name, one that had prospered in his\r\nbusiness, but had little understanding of aught else; insomuch that being\r\nsomewhat of a simpleton, he had many a time been chosen leader of the\r\nband of laud-singers of Santa Maria Novella, and had charge of their\r\nschool; and not a few like offices had he often served, upon which he\r\ngreatly plumed himself. Howbeit, 'twas all for no other reason than that,\r\nbeing a man of substance, he gave liberal doles to the friars; who, for\r\nthat they got thereof, this one hose, another a cloak, and a third a\r\nhood, would teach him good orisons, or give him the paternoster in the\r\nvernacular, or the chant of St. Alexis, or the lament of St. Bernard, or\r\nthe laud of Lady Matilda, or the like sorry stuff, which he greatly\r\nprized, and guarded with jealous care, deeming them all most conducive to\r\nthe salvation of his soul.\r\n\r\nNow our simple master-spinner had a most beautiful wife, and amorous\r\nwithal, her name Monna Tessa. Daughter she was of Mannuccio dalla\r\nCuculla, and not a little knowing and keen-witted; and being enamoured of\r\nFederigo di Neri Pegolotti, a handsome and lusty gallant, as he also of\r\nher, she, knowing her husband's simplicity, took counsel with her maid,\r\nand arranged that Federigo should come to chat with her at a right goodly\r\npleasure-house that the said Gianni had at Camerata, where she was wont\r\nto pass the summer, Gianni coming now and again to sup and sleep, and\r\ngoing back in the morning to his shop, or, maybe, to his laud-singers.\r\nFederigo, who desired nothing better, went up there punctually on the\r\nappointed day about vespers, and as the evening passed without Gianni\r\nmaking his appearance, did most comfortably, and to his no small\r\nsatisfaction, sup and sleep with the lady, who lying in his arms taught\r\nhim that night some six of her husband's lauds. But, as neither she nor\r\nFederigo was minded that this beginning should also be the end of their\r\nintercourse, and that it might not be needful for the maid to go each\r\ntime to make the assignation with him, they came to the following\r\nunderstanding; to wit, that as often as he came and went between the\r\nhouse and an estate that he had a little higher up, he should keep an eye\r\non a vineyard that was beside the house, where he would see an ass's head\r\nstuck on one of the poles of the vineyard, and as often as he observed\r\nthe muzzle turned towards Florence, he might visit her without any sort\r\nof misgiving; and if he found not the door open, he was to tap it thrice,\r\nand she would open it; and when he saw the muzzle of the ass's head\r\nturned towards Fiesole, he was to keep away, for then Gianni would be\r\nthere. Following which plan, they forgathered not seldom: but on one of\r\nthese evenings, when Federigo was to sup with Monna Tessa on two fat\r\ncapons that she bad boiled, it so chanced that Gianni arrived there\r\nunexpectedly and very late, much to the lady's chagrin: so she had a\r\nlittle salt meat boiled apart, on which she supped with her husband; and\r\nthe maid by her orders carried the two boiled capons laid in a spotless\r\nnapkin with plenty of fresh eggs and a bottle of good wine into the\r\ngarden, to which there was access otherwise than from the house, and\r\nwhere she was wont at times to sup with Federigo; and there the maid set\r\nthem down at the foot of a peach-tree, that grew beside a lawn. But in\r\nher vexation she forgot to tell the maid to wait till Federigo should\r\ncome, and let him know that Gianni was there, and he must take his supper\r\nin the garden: and she and Gianni and the maid were scarce gone to bed,\r\nwhen Federigo came and tapped once at the door, which being hard by the\r\nbedroom, Gianni heard the tap, as did also the lady, albeit, that Gianni\r\nmight have no reason to suspect her, she feigned to be asleep. Federigo\r\nwaited a little, and then gave a second tap; whereupon, wondering what it\r\nmight mean, Gianni nudged his wife, saying:--\"Tessa, dost hear what I\r\nhear? Methinks some one has tapped at our door.\" The lady, who had heard\r\nthe noise much better than he, feigned to wake up, and:--\"How? what sayst\r\nthou?\" quoth she. \"I say,\" replied Gianni, \"that, meseems, some one has\r\ntapped at our door.\" \"Tapped at it?\" quoth the lady. \"Alas, my Gianni,\r\nwottest thou not what that is? 'Tis the bogey, which for some nights past\r\nhas so terrified me as never was, insomuch that I never hear it but I pop\r\nmy head under the clothes and venture not to put it out again until 'tis\r\nbroad day.\" \"Come, come, wife,\" quoth Gianni, \"if such it is, be not\r\nalarmed; for before we got into bed I repeated the Te lucis, the\r\nIntemerata, and divers other good orisons, besides which I made the sign\r\nof the cross in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit at each\r\ncorner of the bed; wherefore we need have no fear that it may avail to\r\nhurt us, whatever be its power.\" The lady, lest Federigo, perchance\r\nsuspecting a rival, should take offence, resolved to get up, and let him\r\nunderstand that Gianni was there: so she said to her husband:--\"Well\r\nwell; so sayst thou; but I for my part shall never deem myself safe and\r\nsecure, unless we exorcise it, seeing that thou art here.\" \"Oh!\" said\r\nGianni, \"and how does one exorcise it?\" \"That,\" quoth the lady, \"I know\r\nright well; for t'other day, when I went to Fiesole for the pardoning,\r\none of those anchoresses, the saintliest creature, my Gianni, God be my\r\nwitness, knowing how much afraid I am of the bogey, taught me a holy and\r\nsalutary orison, which she said she had tried many a time before she was\r\nturned anchoress, and always with success. God wot, I should never have\r\nhad courage to try it alone; but as thou art here, I propose that we go\r\nexorcise it together.\" Gianni made answer that he was quite of the same\r\nmind; so up they got, and stole to the door, on the outside of which\r\nFederigo, now suspicious, was still waiting. And as soon as they were\r\nthere:--\"Now,\" quoth the lady to Gianni, \"thou wilt spit, when I tell\r\nthee.\" \"Good,\" said Gianni. Whereupon the lady began her orison,\r\nsaying:--\r\n\r\n  \"Bogey, bogey that goest by night,\r\n  Tail erect, thou cam'st, tail erect, take thy flight\r\n  Hie thee to the garden, and the great peach before,\r\n  Grease upon grease, and droppings five score\r\n  Of my hen shalt thou find:\r\n  Set the flask thy lips to,\r\n  Then away like the wind,\r\n  And no scathe unto me or my Gianni do.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when she had done:--\"Now, Gianni,\" quoth she, \"spit\": and Gianni\r\nspat.\r\n\r\nThere was no more room for jealousy in Federigo's mind as he heard all\r\nthis from without; nay, for all his disappointment, he was like to burst\r\nwith suppressed laughter, and when Gianni spat, he muttered under his\r\nbreath:--\"Now out with thy teeth.\" The lady, having after this fashion\r\nthrice exorcised the bogey, went back to bed with her husband. Federigo,\r\ndisappointed of the supper that he was to have had with her, and\r\napprehending the words of the orison aright, hied him to the garden, and\r\nhaving found the two capons and the wine and the eggs at the foot of the\r\npeach-tree, took them home with him, and supped very comfortably. And\r\nmany a hearty laugh had he and the lady over the exorcism during their\r\nsubsequent intercourse.\r\n\r\nNow, true it is that some say that the lady had in fact turned the ass's\r\nhead towards Fiesole, but that a husbandman, passing through the\r\nvineyard, had given it a blow with his stick, whereby it had swung round,\r\nand remained fronting Florence, and so it was that Federigo thought that\r\nhe was invited, and came to the house, and that the lady's orison was on\r\nthis wise:--\r\n\r\n  \"Bogey, a God's name, away thee hie,\r\n  For whoe'er turned the ass's head, 'twas not I:\r\n  Another it was, foul fall his eyne;\r\n  And here am I with Gianni mine.\"\r\n\r\nWherefore Federigo was fain to take himself off, having neither slept nor\r\nsupped.\r\n\r\nBut a neighbour of mine, a lady well advanced in years, tells me that, by\r\nwhat she heard when she was a girl, both stories are true; but that the\r\nlatter concerned not Gianni Lotteringhi but one Gianni di Nello, that\r\nlived at Porta San Piero, and was no less a numskull than Gianni\r\nLotteringhi. Wherefore, dear my ladies, you are at liberty to choose\r\nwhich exorcism you prefer, or take both if you like. They are both of\r\nextraordinary and approved virtue in such cases, as you have heard: get\r\nthem by heart, therefore, and they may yet stand you in good stead.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL II.\r\n\r\n--\r\nHer husband returning home, Peronella bestows her lover in a tun; which,\r\nbeing sold by her husband, she avers to have been already sold by herself\r\nto one that is inside examining it to see if it be sound. Whereupon the\r\nlover jumps out, and causes the husband to scour the tun for him, and\r\nafterwards to carry it to his house.\r\n--\r\n\r\nGreat indeed was the laughter with which Emilia's story was received;\r\nwhich being ended, and her orison commended by all as good and salutary,\r\nthe king bade Filostrato follow suit; and thus Filostrato began:--Dearest\r\nmy ladies, so many are the tricks that men play you, and most of all your\r\nhusbands, that, when from time to time it so befalls that some lady plays\r\nher husband a trick, the circumstance, whether it come within your own\r\ncognizance or be told you by another, should not only give you joy but\r\nshould incite you to publish it on all hands, that men may be ware, that,\r\nknowing as they are, their ladies also, on their part, know somewhat:\r\nwhich cannot but be serviceable to you, for that one does not rashly\r\nessay to take another with guile whom one wots not to lack that quality.\r\nCan we doubt, then, that, should but the converse that we shall hold\r\nto-day touching this matter come to be bruited among men, 'twould serve\r\nto put a most notable check upon the tricks they play you, by doing them\r\nto wit of the tricks, which you, in like manner, when you are so minded,\r\nmay play them? Wherefore 'tis my intention to tell you in what manner a\r\nyoung girl, albeit she was but of low rank, did, on the spur of the\r\nmoment, beguile her husband to her own deliverance.\r\n\r\n'Tis no long time since at Naples a poor man, a mason by craft, took to\r\nwife a fair and amorous maiden--Peronella was her name--who eked out by\r\nspinning what her husband made by his craft; and so the pair managed as\r\nbest they might on very slender means. And as chance would have it, one\r\nof the gallants of the city, taking note of this Peronella one day, and\r\nbeing mightily pleased with her, fell in love with her, and by this means\r\nand that so prevailed that he won her to accord him her intimacy. Their\r\ntimes of forgathering they concerted as follows:--to wit, that, her\r\nhusband being wont to rise betimes of a morning to go to work or seek for\r\nwork, the gallant was to be where he might see him go forth, and, the\r\nstreet where she dwelt, which is called Avorio, being scarce inhabited,\r\nwas to come into the house as soon as her husband was well out of it; and\r\nso times not a few they did. But on one of these occasions it befell\r\nthat, the good man being gone forth, and Giannello Sirignario--such was\r\nthe gallant's name--being come into the house, and being with Peronella,\r\nafter a while, back came the good man, though 'twas not his wont to\r\nreturn until the day was done; and finding the door locked, he knocked,\r\nand after knocking, he fell a saying to himself:--O God, praised be Thy\r\nname forever; for that, albeit Thou hast ordained that I be poor, at\r\nleast Thou hast accorded me the consolation of a good and honest girl for\r\nwife. Mark what haste she made to shut the door when I was gone forth,\r\nthat none else might enter to give her trouble.\r\n\r\nNow Peronella knew by his knock that 'twas her husband;\r\nwherefore:--\"Alas, Giannello mine,\" quoth she, \"I am a dead woman, for\r\nlo, here is my husband, foul fall him! come back! What it may import, I\r\nknow not, for he is never wont to come back at this hour; perchance he\r\ncaught sight of thee as thou camest in. However, for the love of God, be\r\nit as it may, get thee into this tun that thou seest here, and I will go\r\nopen to him, and we shall see what is the occasion of this sudden return\r\nthis morning.\" So Giannello forthwith got into the tun, and Peronella\r\nwent to the door, and let in her husband, and gave him black looks,\r\nsaying:--\"This is indeed a surprise that thou art back so soon this\r\nmorning! By what I see thou hast a mind to make this a holiday, that thou\r\nreturnest tools in hand; if so, what are we to live on? whence shall we\r\nget bread to eat? Thinkest thou I will let thee pawn my gown and other\r\nbits of clothes? Day and night I do nought else but spin, insomuch that\r\nthe flesh is fallen away from my nails, that at least I may have oil\r\nenough to keep our lamp alight. Husband, husband, there is never a woman\r\nin the neighbourhood but marvels and mocks at me, that I am at such\r\nlabour and pains; and thou comest home to me with thy hands hanging idle,\r\nwhen thou shouldst be at work.\" Which said, she fell a weeping and\r\nrepeating:--\"Alas, alas, woe 's me, in what evil hour was I born? in what\r\nluckless moment came I hither, I, that might have had so goodly a young\r\nman, and I would not, to take up with one that bestows never a thought on\r\nher whom he has made his wife? Other women have a good time with their\r\nlovers, and never a one have we here but has two or three; they take\r\ntheir pleasure, and make their husbands believe that the moon is the sun;\r\nand I, alas! for that I am an honest woman, and have no such casual\r\namours, I suffer, and am hard bested. I know not why I provide not myself\r\nwith one of these lovers, as others do. Give good heed, husband, to what\r\nI say: were I disposed to dishonour thee, I were at no loss to find the\r\nman: for here are gallants enough, that love me, and court me, and have\r\nsent me many an offer of money--no stint--or dresses or jewels, should I\r\nprefer them; but my pride would never suffer it, because I was not born\r\nof a woman of that sort: and now thou comest home to me when thou\r\noughtest to be at work.\"\r\n\r\nWhereto the husband:--\"Wife, wife, for God's sake distress not thyself:\r\nthou shouldst give me credit for knowing what manner of woman thou art,\r\nas indeed I have partly seen this morning. True it is that I went out to\r\nwork; but 'tis plain that thou knowest not, as indeed I knew not, that\r\nto-day 'tis the feast of San Galeone, and a holiday, and that is why I am\r\ncome home at this hour; but nevertheless I have found means to provide us\r\nwith bread for more than a month; for I have sold to this gentleman, whom\r\nthou seest with me, the tun, thou wottest of, seeing that it has\r\nencumbered the house so long, and he will give me five gigliats for it.\"\r\nQuoth then Peronella:--\"And all this but adds to my trouble: thou, that\r\nart a man, and goest abroad, and shouldst know affairs, hast sold for\r\nfive gigliats a tun, which I, that am but a woman, and was scarce ever\r\nout of doors, have, for that it took up so much room in the house, sold\r\nfor seven gigliats to a good man, that but now, as thou cam'st back, got\r\ntherein, to see if 'twere sound.\" So hearing, the husband was overjoyed,\r\nand said to the man that was come to take it away:--\"Good man, I wish\r\nthee Godspeed; for, as thou hearest, my wife has sold the tun for seven\r\ngigliats, whereas thou gavest me only five.\" Whereupon:--\"So be it,\" said\r\nthe good man, and took himself off. Then said Peronella to her\r\nhusband:--\"Now, as thou art here, come up, and arrange the matter with\r\nthe good man.\"\r\n\r\nNow Giannello, who, meanwhile, had been all on the alert to discover if\r\nthere were aught he had to fear or be on his guard against, no sooner\r\nheard Peronella's last words, than he sprang out of the tun, and feigning\r\nto know nought of her husband's return, began thus:--\"Where art thou,\r\ngood dame?\" Whereto the husband, coming up, answered:--\"Here am I: what\r\nwouldst thou of me?\" Quoth Giannello:--\"And who art thou? I would speak\r\nwith the lady with whom I struck the bargain for this tun.\" Then said the\r\ngood man:--\"Have no fear, you can deal with me; for I am her husband.\"\r\nQuoth then Giannello:--\"The tun seems to me sound enough; but I think you\r\nmust have let the lees remain in it; for 'tis all encrusted with I know\r\nnot what that is so dry, that I cannot raise it with the nail; wherefore\r\nI am not minded to take it unless I first see it scoured.\" Whereupon\r\nPeronella:--\"To be sure: that shall not hinder the bargain; my husband\r\nwill scour it clean.\" And:--\"Well and good,\" said the husband.\r\n\r\nSo he laid down his tools, stripped himself to his vest, sent for a light\r\nand a rasp, and was in the tun, and scraping away, in a trice. Whereupon\r\nPeronella, as if she were curious to see what he did, thrust her head\r\ninto the vent of the tun, which was of no great size, and therewithal one\r\nof her arms up to the shoulder, and fell a saying:--\"Scrape here, and\r\nhere, and there too, and look, there is a bit left here.\" So, she being\r\nin this posture, directing and admonishing her husband, Giannello, who\r\nhad not, that morning, fully satisfied his desire, when the husband\r\narrived, now seeing that as he would, he might not, brought his mind to\r\nhis circumstances, and resolved to take his pleasure as he might:\r\nwherefore he made up to the lady, who completely blocked the vent of the\r\ntun; and even on such wise as on the open champaign the wild and lusty\r\nhorses do amorously assail the mares of Parthia, he sated his youthful\r\nappetite; and so it was that almost at the same moment that he did so,\r\nand was off, the tun was scoured, the husband came forth of it, and\r\nPeronella withdrew her head from the vent, and turning to Giannello,\r\nsaid:--\"Take this light, good man, and see if 'tis scoured to thy mind.\"\r\nWhereupon Giannello, looking into the tun, said that 'twas in good trim,\r\nand that he was well content, and paid the husband the seven gigliats,\r\nand caused him carry the tun to his house.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL III.\r\n\r\n--\r\nFra Rinaldo lies with his gossip: her husband finds him in the room with\r\nher; and they make him believe that he was curing his godson of worms by\r\na charm.\r\n--\r\n\r\nFilostrato knew not how so to veil what he said touching the mares of\r\nParthia, but that the keen-witted ladies laughed thereat, making as if\r\n'twas at somewhat else. However, his story being ended, the king called\r\nfor one from Elisa, who, all obedience, thus began:--Debonair my ladies,\r\nwe heard from Emilia how the bogey is exorcised, and it brought to my\r\nmind a story of another incantation: 'tis not indeed so good a story as\r\nhers; but, as no other, germane to our theme, occurs to me at present, I\r\nwill relate it.\r\n\r\nYou are to know, then, that there dwelt aforetime at Siena a young man,\r\nright gallant and of honourable family, his name Rinaldo; who, being in\r\nthe last degree enamoured of one of his neighbours, a most beautiful\r\ngentlewoman and the wife of a rich man, was not without hopes that, if he\r\ncould but find means to speak with her privately, he might have of her\r\nall that he desired; but seeing no way, and the lady being pregnant, he\r\ncast about how he might become her child's godfather. Wherefore, having\r\ningratiated himself with her husband, he broached the matter to him in as\r\ngraceful a manner as he might; and 'twas arranged. So Rinaldo, being now\r\ngodfather to Madonna Agnesa's child, and having a more colourable pretext\r\nfor speaking to her, took courage, and told her in words that message of\r\nhis heart which she had long before read in his eyes; but though 'twas\r\nnot displeasing to the lady to hear, it availed him but little.\r\n\r\nNow not long afterwards it so befell that, whatever may have been his\r\nreason, Rinaldo betook him to friarage; and whether it was that he found\r\ngood pasture therein, or what not, he persevered in that way of life. And\r\nthough for a while after he was turned friar, he laid aside the love he\r\nbore his gossip, and certain other vanities, yet in course of time,\r\nwithout putting off the habit, he resumed them, and began to take a pride\r\nin his appearance, and to go dressed in fine clothes, and to be quite the\r\ntrim gallant, and to compose songs and sonnets and ballades, and to sing\r\nthem, and to make a brave shew in all else that pertained to his new\r\ncharacter. But why enlarge upon our Fra Rinaldo, of whom we speak? what\r\nfriars are there that do not the like? Ah! opprobrium of a corrupt world!\r\nSleek-faced and sanguine, daintily clad, dainty in all their accessories,\r\nthey ruffle it shamelessly before the eyes of all, shewing not as doves\r\nbut as insolent cocks with raised crest and swelling bosom, and, what is\r\nworse (to say nought of the vases full of electuaries and unguents, the\r\nboxes packed with divers comfits, the pitchers and phials of artificial\r\nwaters, and oils, the flagons brimming with Malmsey and Greek and other\r\nwines of finest quality, with which their cells are so packed that they\r\nshew not as the cells of friars, but rather as apothecaries' or\r\nperfumers' shops), they blush not to be known to be gouty, flattering\r\nthemselves that other folk wot not that long fasts and many of them, and\r\ncoarse fare and little of it, and sober living, make men lean and thin\r\nand for the most part healthy; or if any malady come thereof, at any rate\r\n'tis not the gout, the wonted remedy for which is chastity and all beside\r\nthat belongs to the regimen of a humble friar. They flatter themselves,\r\ntoo, that others wot not that over and above the meagre diet, long vigils\r\nand orisons and strict discipline ought to mortify men and make them\r\npale, and that neither St. Dominic nor St. Francis went clad in stuff\r\ndyed in grain or any other goodly garb, but in coarse woollen habits\r\ninnocent of the dyer's art, made to keep out the cold, and not for shew.\r\nTo which matters 'twere well God had a care, no less than to the souls of\r\nthe simple folk by whom our friars are nourished.\r\n\r\nFra Rinaldo, then, being come back to his first affections, took to\r\nvisiting his gossip very frequently; and gaining confidence, began with\r\nmore insistence than before to solicit her to that which he craved of\r\nher. So, being much urged, the good lady, to whom Fra Rinaldo, perhaps,\r\nseemed now more handsome than of yore, had recourse one day, when she\r\nfelt herself unusually hard pressed by him, to the common expedient of\r\nall that would fain concede what is asked of them, and said:--\"Oh! but\r\nFra Rinaldo, do friars then do this sort of thing?\" \"Madam,\" replied Fra\r\nRinaldo, \"when I divest myself of this habit, which I shall do easily\r\nenough, you will see that I am a man furnished as other men, and no\r\nfriar.\" Whereto with a truly comical air the lady made answer:--\"Alas!\r\nwoe's me! you are my child's godfather: how might it be? nay, but 'twere\r\na very great mischief; and many a time I have heard that 'tis a most\r\nheinous sin; and without a doubt, were it not so, I would do as you\r\nwish.\" \"If,\" said Fra Rinaldo, \"you forego it for such a scruple as this,\r\nyou are a fool for your pains. I say not that 'tis no sin; but there is\r\nno sin so great but God pardons it, if one repent. Now tell me: whether\r\nis more truly father to your son, I that held him at the font, or your\r\nhusband that begot him?\" \"My husband,\" replied the lady. \"Sooth say you,\"\r\nreturned the friar, \"and does not your husband lie with you?\" \"Why, yes,\"\r\nsaid the lady. \"Then,\" rejoined the friar, \"I that am less truly your\r\nson's father than your husband, ought also to lie with you, as does your\r\nhusband.\" The lady was no logician, and needed little to sway her: she\r\ntherefore believed or feigned to believe that what the friar said was\r\ntrue. So:-- \"Who might avail to answer your words of wisdom?\" quoth she;\r\nand presently forgot the godfather in the lover, and complied with his\r\ndesires. Nor had they begun their course to end it forthwith: but under\r\ncover of the friar's sponsorship, which set them more at ease, as it\r\nrendered them less open to suspicion, they forgathered again and again.\r\n\r\nBut on one of these occasions it so befell that Fra Rinaldo, being come\r\nto the lady's house, where he espied none else save a very pretty and\r\ndainty little maid that waited on the lady, sent his companion away with\r\nher into the pigeon-house, there to teach her the paternoster, while he\r\nand the lady, holding her little boy by the hand, went into the bedroom,\r\nlocked themselves in, got them on to a divan that was there, and began to\r\ndisport them. And while thus they sped the time, it chanced that the\r\nfather returned, and, before any was ware of him, was at the bedroom\r\ndoor, and knocked, and called the lady by her name. Whereupon:--\"'Tis as\r\nmuch as my life is worth,\" quoth Madonna Agnesa; \"lo, here is my husband;\r\nand the occasion of our intimacy cannot but be now apparent to him.\"\r\n\"Sooth say you,\" returned Fra Rinaldo, who was undressed, that is to say,\r\nhad thrown off his habit and hood, and was in his tunic; \"if I had but my\r\nhabit and hood on me in any sort, 'twould be another matter; but if you\r\nlet him in, and he find me thus, 'twill not be possible to put any face\r\non it.\" But with an inspiration as happy as sudden:--\"Now get them on\r\nyou,\" quoth the lady; \"and when you have them on, take your godson in\r\nyour arms, and give good heed to what I shall say to him, that your words\r\nmay accord with mine; and leave the rest to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe good man was still knocking, when his wife made answer:-- \"Coming,\r\ncoming.\" And so up she got, and put on a cheerful countenance and hied\r\nher to the door, and opened it and said:--\"Husband mine: well indeed was\r\nit for us that in came Fra Rinaldo, our sponsor; 'twas God that sent him\r\nto us; for in sooth, but for that, we had to-day lost our boy.\" Which the\r\npoor simpleton almost swooned to hear; and:--\"How so?\" quoth he. \"O\r\nhusband mine,\" replied the lady, \"he was taken but now, all of a sudden,\r\nwith a fainting fit, so that I thought he was dead: and what to do or say\r\nI knew not, had not Fra Rinaldo, our sponsor, come just in the nick of\r\ntime, and set him on his shoulder, and said:--'Gossip, 'tis that he has\r\nworms in his body, and getting, as they do, about the heart, they might\r\nonly too readily be the death of him; but fear not; I will say a charm\r\nthat will kill them all; and before I take my leave, you will see your\r\nboy as whole as you ever saw him.' And because to say certain of the\r\nprayers thou shouldst have been with us, and the maid knew not where to\r\nfind thee, he caused his companion to say them at the top of the house,\r\nand he and I came in here. And for that 'tis not meet for any but the\r\nboy's mother to assist at such a service, that we might not be troubled\r\nwith any one else, we locked the door; and he yet has him in his arms;\r\nand I doubt not that he only waits till his companion have said his\r\nprayers, and then the charm will be complete; for the boy is already\r\nquite himself again.\"\r\n\r\nThe good simple soul, taking all this for sooth, and overwrought by the\r\nlove he bore his son, was entirely without suspicion of the trick his\r\nwife was playing him, and heaving a great sigh, said:--\"I will go look\r\nfor him.\" \"Nay,\" replied the wife, \"go not: thou wouldst spoil the\r\nefficacy of the charm: wait here; I will go see if thou mayst safely go;\r\nand will call thee.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Fra Rinaldo, who had heard all that passed, and was in his\r\ncanonicals, and quite at his ease, and had the boy in his arms, having\r\nmade sure that all was as it should be, cried out:--\"Gossip, do I not\r\nhear the father's voice out there?\" \"Ay indeed, Sir,\" replied the\r\nsimpleton. \"Come in then,\" said Fra Rinaldo. So in came the simpleton.\r\nWhereupon quoth Fra Rinaldo:--\"I restore to you your boy made whole by\r\nthe grace of God, whom but now I scarce thought you would see alive at\r\nvespers. You will do well to have his image fashioned in wax, not less\r\nthan life-size, and set it for a thanksgiving to God, before the statue\r\nof Master St. Ambrose, by whose merits you have this favour of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy, catching sight of his father, ran to him with joyous greetings,\r\nas little children are wont; and the father, taking him in his arms, and\r\nweeping as if he were restored to him from the grave, fell by turns a\r\nkissing him and thanking his godfather, that he had cured him. Fra\r\nRinaldo's companion, who had taught the maid not one paternoster only,\r\nbut peradventure four or more, and by giving her a little purse of white\r\nthread that a nun had given him, had made her his devotee, no sooner\r\nheard Fra Rinaldo call the simpleton into his wife's room, than he\r\nstealthily got him to a place whence he might see and hear what was going\r\non. Observing that the affair was now excellently arranged, he came down,\r\nand entered the chamber, saying:--\"Fra Rinaldo, those four prayers that\r\nyou bade me say, I have said them all.\" \"Then well done, my brother,\"\r\nquoth Fra Rinaldo, \"well-breathed must thou be. For my part, I had but\r\nsaid two, when my gossip came in; but what with thy travail and mine, God\r\nof His grace has vouchsafed-us the healing or the boy.\" The simpleton\r\nthen had good wine and comfits brought in, and did the honours to the\r\ngodfather and his companion in such sort as their occasions did most\r\ndemand. He then ushered them forth of the house, commending them to God;\r\nand without delay had the waxen image made, and directed it to be set up\r\nwith the others in front of the statue of St. Ambrose, not, be it\r\nunderstood, St. Ambrose of Milan.(1)\r\n\r\n(1) The statue would doubtless be that of St. Ambrose of Siena, of the\r\nDominican Order.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IV.\r\n\r\n--\r\nTofano one night locks his wife out of the house: she, finding that by no\r\nentreaties may she prevail upon him to let her in, feigns to throw\r\nherself into a well, throwing therein a great stone. Tofano hies him\r\nforth of the house, and runs to the spot: she goes into the house, and\r\nlocks him out, and hurls abuse at him from within.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe king no sooner wist that Elisa's story was ended, than, turning to\r\nLauretta, he signified his will that she should tell somewhat: wherefore\r\nwithout delay she began:--O Love, how great and signal is thy potency!\r\nhow notable thy stratagems, thy devices! Was there ever, shall there ever\r\nbe, philosopher or adept competent to inspire, counsel and teach in such\r\nsort as thou by thine unpremeditated art dost tutor those that follow thy\r\nlead? Verily laggard teachers are they all in comparison of thee, as by\r\nthe matters heretofore set forth may very well be understood. To which\r\nstore I will add, loving ladies, a stratagem used by a woman of quite\r\nordinary understanding, and of such a sort that I know not by whom she\r\ncould have been taught it save by Love.\r\n\r\nKnow, then, that there dwelt aforetime at Arezzo a rich man, Tofano by\r\nname, who took to wife Monna Ghita, a lady exceeding fair, of whom, for\r\nwhat cause he knew not, he presently grew jealous. Whereof the lady being\r\nware, waxed resentful, and having on divers occasions demanded of him the\r\nreason of his jealousy, and gotten from him nought precise, but only\r\ngeneralities and trivialities, resolved at last to give him cause enough\r\nto die of that evil which without cause he so much dreaded. And being\r\nware that a gallant, whom she deemed well worthy of her, was enamoured of\r\nher, she, using due discretion, came to an understanding with him; which\r\nbeing brought to the point that it only remained to give effect to their\r\nwords in act, the lady cast about to devise how this might be. And\r\nwitting that, among other bad habits that her husband had, he was too\r\nfond of his cups, she would not only commend indulgence, but cunningly\r\nand not seldom incite him thereto; insomuch that, well-nigh as often as\r\nshe was so minded, she led him to drink to excess; and when she saw that\r\nhe was well drunken, she would put him to bed; and so not once only but\r\ndivers times without any manner of risk she forgathered with her lover;\r\nnay, presuming upon her husband's intoxication, she grew so bold that,\r\nnot content with bringing her lover into her house, she would at times go\r\nspend a great part of the night with him at his house, which was not far\r\noff.\r\n\r\nNow such being the enamoured lady's constant practice, it so befell that\r\nthe dishonoured husband took note that, while she egged him on to drink,\r\nshe herself drank never a drop; whereby he came to suspect the truth, to\r\nwit, that the lady was making him drunk, that afterwards she might take\r\nher pleasure while he slept. And being minded to put his surmise to the\r\nproof, one evening, having drunken nought all day, he mimicked never so\r\ndrunken a sot both in speech and in carriage. The lady, deeming him to be\r\nreally as he appeared, and that 'twas needless to ply him with liquor,\r\npresently put him to bed. Which done, she, as she at times was wont, hied\r\nher forth to her lover's house, where she tarried until midnight. Tofano\r\nno sooner perceived that his wife was gone, than up he got, hied him to\r\nthe door, locked it, and then posted himself at the window to observe her\r\nreturn, and let her know that he was ware of her misconduct. So there he\r\nstood until the lady returned, and finding herself locked out, was\r\nannoyed beyond measure, and sought to force the door open. Tofano let her\r\ntry her strength upon it a while, and then:--\"Madam,\" quoth he, \"'tis all\r\nto no purpose: thou canst not get in. Go get thee back thither where thou\r\nhast tarried all this while, and rest assured that thou shalt never\r\nrecross this threshold, until I have done thee such honour as is meet for\r\nthee in the presence of thy kinsfolk and neighbours.\" Thereupon the lady\r\nfell entreating him to be pleased to open to her for the love of God, for\r\nthat she was not come whence he supposed, but had only been passing the\r\ntime with one of her gossips, because the nights were long, and she could\r\nnot spend the whole time either in sleep or in solitary watching. But her\r\nsupplications availed her nothing, for the fool was determined that all\r\nArezzo should know their shame, whereof as yet none wist aught. So as\r\n'twas idle to entreat, the lady assumed a menacing tone, saying:--\"So\r\nthou open not to me, I will make thee the saddest man alive.\" Whereto\r\nTofano made answer:--\"And what then canst thou do?\" The lady, her wits\r\nsharpened by Love, rejoined:--\"Rather than endure the indignity to which\r\nthou wouldst unjustly subject me, I will cast myself into the well hard\r\nby here, and when I am found dead there, all the world will believe that\r\n'twas thou that didst it in thy cups, and so thou wilt either have to\r\nflee and lose all that thou hast and be outlawed, or forfeit thy head as\r\nguilty of my death, as indeed thou wilt be.\" But, for all she said,\r\nTofano wavered not a jot in his foolish purpose. So at last:--\"Lo, now,\"\r\nquoth the lady, \"I can no more abide thy surly humour: God forgive thee:\r\nI leave thee my distaff here, which be careful to bestow in a safe\r\nplace.\" So saying, away she hied her to the well, and, the night being so\r\ndark that wayfarers could scarce see one another as they passed, she took\r\nup a huge stone that was by the well, and ejaculating, \"God forgive me!\"\r\ndropped it therein. Tofano, hearing the mighty splash that the stone made\r\nas it struck the water, never doubted that she had cast herself in: so,\r\nbucket and rope in hand, he flung himself out of the house, and came\r\nrunning to the well to her rescue. The lady had meanwhile hidden herself\r\nhard by the door, and seeing him make for the well, was in the house in a\r\ntrice, and having locked the door, hied her to the window, and greeted\r\nhim with:--\"'Tis while thou art drinking, not now, when the night is far\r\nspent, that thou shouldst temper thy wine with water.\" Thus derided,\r\nTofano came back to the door, and finding his ingress barred, began\r\nadjuring her to let him in. Whereupon, changing the low tone she had\r\nhitherto used for one so shrill that 'twas well-nigh a shriek, she broke\r\nout with:--\"By the Holy Rood, tedious drunken sot that thou art, thou\r\ngettest no admittance here to-night; thy ways are more than I can endure:\r\n'tis time I let all the world know what manner of man thou art, and at\r\nwhat hour of the night thou comest home.\" Tofano, on his part, now grew\r\nangry, and began loudly to upbraid her; insomuch that the neighbours,\r\naroused by the noise, got up, men and women alike, and looked out of the\r\nwindows, and asked what was the matter. Whereupon the lady fell a weeping\r\nand saying:--\"'Tis this wicked man, who comes home drunk at even, or\r\nfalls asleep in some tavern, and then returns at this hour. Long and to\r\nno purpose have I borne with him; but 'tis now past endurance, and I have\r\ndone him this indignity of locking him out of the house in the hope that\r\nperchance it may cause him to mend his ways.\"\r\n\r\nTofano, on his part, told, dolt that he was, just what had happened, and\r\nwas mighty menacing. Whereupon:--\"Now mark,\" quoth the lady to the\r\nneighbours, \"the sort of man he is! What would you say if I were, as he\r\nis, in the street, and he were in the house, as I am? God's faith, I\r\ndoubt you would believe what he said. Hereby you may gauge his sense. He\r\ntells you that I have done just what, I doubt not, he has done himself.\r\nHe thought to terrify me by throwing I know not what into the well,\r\nwherein would to God he had thrown himself indeed, and drowned himself,\r\nwhereby the wine of which he has taken more than enough, had been watered\r\nto some purpose!\" The neighbours, men and women alike, now with one\r\naccord gave tongue, censuring Tofano, throwing all the blame upon him,\r\nand answering what he alleged against the lady with loud recrimination;\r\nand in short the bruit, passing from neighbour to neighbour, reached at\r\nlast the ears of the lady's kinsfolk; who hied them to the spot, and\r\nbeing apprised of the affair from this, that and the other of the\r\nneighbours, laid hands on Tofano, and beat him till he was black and blue\r\nfrom head to foot. Which done, they entered his house, stripped it of all\r\nthat belonged to the lady, and took her home with them, bidding Tofano\r\nlook for worse to come. Thus hard bested, and ruing the plight in which\r\nhis jealousy had landed him, Tofano, who loved his wife with all his\r\nheart, set some friends to work to patch matters up, whereby he did in\r\nfact induce his lady to forgive him and live with him again, albeit he\r\nwas fain to promise her never again to be jealous, and to give her leave\r\nto amuse herself to her heart's content, provided she used such\r\ndiscretion that he should not be ware of it. On such wise, like the churl\r\nand booby that he was, being despoiled, he made terms. Now long live\r\nLove, and perish war, and all that wage it!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL V.\r\n\r\n--\r\nA jealous husband disguises himself as a priest, and hears his own wife's\r\nconfession: she tells him that she loves a priest, who comes to her every\r\nnight. The husband posts himself at the door to watch for the priest, and\r\nmeanwhile the lady brings her lover in by the roof, and tarries with him.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen Lauretta had done speaking, and all had commended the lady, for that\r\nshe had done well, and treated her caitiff husband as he had deserved,\r\nthe king, not to lose time, turned to Fiammetta, and graciously bade her\r\ntake up her parable; which she did on this wise:--Most noble ladies, the\r\nforegoing story prompts me likewise to discourse of one of these jealous\r\nhusbands, deeming that they are justly requited by their wives, more\r\nespecially when they grow jealous without due cause. And had our\r\nlegislators taken account of everything, I am of opinion that they would\r\nhave visited ladies in such a case with no other penalty than such as\r\nthey provide for those that offend in self-defence, seeing that a jealous\r\nhusband does cunningly practise against the life of his lady, and most\r\nassiduously machinate her death. All the week the wife stays at home,\r\noccupied with her domestic duties; after which, on the day that is sacred\r\nto joy, she, like every one else, craves some solace, some peace, some\r\nrecreation, not unreasonably, for she craves but what the husbandmen take\r\nin the fields, the craftsmen in the city, the magistrates in the courts,\r\nnay what God Himself took, when He rested from all His labours on the\r\nseventh day, and which laws human and Divine, mindful alike of the honour\r\nof God and the common well-being, have ordained, appropriating certain\r\ndays to work, and others to repose. To which ordinance these jealous\r\nhusbands will in no wise conform; on the contrary by then most sedulously\r\nsecluding their wives, they make those days which to all other women are\r\ngladsome, to them most grievous and dolorous. And what an affliction it\r\nis to the poor creatures, they alone know, who have proved it; for which\r\nreason, to sum up, I say that a wife is rather to be commended than\r\ncensured, if she take her revenge upon a husband that is jealous without\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nKnow then that at Rimini there dwelt a merchant, a man of great substance\r\nin lands and goods and money, who, having a most beautiful woman to wife,\r\nwaxed inordinately jealous of her, and that for no better reason than\r\nthat, loving her greatly, and esteeming her exceeding fair, and knowing\r\nthat she did her utmost endeavour to pleasure him, he must needs suppose\r\nthat every man loved her, and esteemed her fair, and that she, moreover,\r\nwas as zealous to stand well with every other man as with himself;\r\nwhereby you may see that he was a poor creature, and of little sense.\r\nBeing thus so deeply infected with jealousy, he kept so strict and close\r\nwatch over her, that some, maybe, have lain under sentence of death and\r\nbeen less rigorously confined by their warders. 'Twas not merely that the\r\nlady might not go to a wedding, or a festal gathering, or even to church,\r\nor indeed set foot out of doors in any sort; but she dared not so much as\r\nshew herself at a window, or cast a glance outside the house, no matter\r\nfor what purpose. Wherefore she led a most woeful life of it, and found\r\nit all the harder to bear because she knew herself to be innocent.\r\nAccordingly, seeing herself evilly entreated by her husband without good\r\ncause, she cast about how for her own consolation she might devise means\r\nto justify his usage of her. And for that, as she might not shew herself\r\nat the window, there could be no interchange of amorous glances between\r\nher and any man that passed along the street, but she wist that in the\r\nnext house there was a goodly and debonair gallant, she bethought her,\r\nthat, if there were but a hole in the wall that divided the two houses,\r\nshe might watch thereat, until she should have sight of the gallant on\r\nsuch wise that she might speak to him, and give him her love, if he cared\r\nto have it, and, if so it might be contrived, forgather with him now and\r\nagain, and after this fashion relieve the burden of her woeful life,\r\nuntil such time as the evil spirit should depart from her husband. So\r\npeering about, now here, now there, when her husband was away, she found\r\nin a very remote part of the house a place, where, by chance, the wall\r\nhad a little chink in it. Peering through which, she made out, though not\r\nwithout great difficulty, that on the other side was a room, and said to\r\nherself:--If this were Filippo's room--Filippo was the name of the\r\ngallant, her neighbour--I should be already halfway to my goal. So\r\ncautiously, through her maid, who was grieved to see her thus languish,\r\nshe made quest, and discovered that it was indeed the gallant's room,\r\nwhere he slept quite alone. Wherefore she now betook her frequently to\r\nthe aperture, and whenever she was ware that the gallant was in the room,\r\nshe would let fall a pebble or the like trifle; whereby at length she\r\nbrought the gallant to the other side of the aperture to see what the\r\nmatter was. Whereupon she softly called him, and he knowing her voice,\r\nanswered; and so, having now the opportunity she had sought, she in few\r\nwords opened to him all her mind. The gallant, being overjoyed, wrought\r\nat the aperture on such wise that albeit none might be ware thereof, he\r\nenlarged it; and there many a time they held converse together, and\r\ntouched hands, though further they might not go by reason of the\r\nassiduous watch that the jealous husband kept.\r\n\r\nNow towards Christmas the lady told her husband that, if he approved, she\r\nwould fain go on Christmas morning to church, and confess and\r\ncommunicate, like other Christians. \"And what sins,\" quoth he, \"hast thou\r\ncommitted, that wouldst be shriven?\" \"How?\" returned the lady; \"dost thou\r\ntake me for a saint? For all thou keepest me so close, thou must know\r\nvery well that I am like all other mortals. However, I am not minded to\r\nconfess to thee, for that thou art no priest.\" Her husband, whose\r\nsuspicions were excited by what she had said, cast about how he might\r\ndiscover these sins of hers, and having bethought him of what seemed an\r\napt expedient, made answer that she had his consent, but he would not\r\nhave her go to any church but their own chapel, where she might hie her\r\nbetimes in the morning, and confess either to their own chaplain or some\r\nother priest that the chaplain might assign her, but to none other, and\r\npresently return to the house. The lady thought she half understood him,\r\nbut she answered only that she would do as he required. Christmas morning\r\ncame, and with the dawn the lady rose, dressed herself, and hied her to\r\nthe church appointed by her husband, who also rose, and hied him to the\r\nsame church, where he arrived before her; and having already concerted\r\nmatters with the priest that was in charge, he forthwith put on one of\r\nthe priest's robes with a great hood, overshadowing the face, such as we\r\nsee priests wear, and which he pulled somewhat forward; and so disguised\r\nhe seated himself in the choir.\r\n\r\nOn entering the church the lady asked for the priest, who came, and\r\nlearning that she was minded to confess, said that he could not hear her\r\nhimself, but would send her one of his brethren; so away he hied him and\r\nsent her, in an evil hour for him, her husband. For though he wore an air\r\nof great solemnity, and 'twas not yet broad day, and he had pulled the\r\nhood well over his eyes, yet all did not avail, but that his lady\r\nforthwith recognized him, and said to herself:--God be praised! why, the\r\njealous rogue is turned priest: but leave it me to give him that whereof\r\nhe is in quest. So she feigned not to know him, and seated herself at his\r\nfeet. (I should tell you that he had put some pebbles in his mouth, that\r\nhis speech, being impeded, might not betray him to his wife, and in all\r\nother respects he deemed himself so thoroughly disguised that there was\r\nnought whereby she might recognize him.) Now, to come to the confession,\r\nthe lady, after informing him that she was married, told him among other\r\nmatters that she was enamoured of a priest, who came every night to lie\r\nwith her. Which to hear was to her husband as if he were stricken through\r\nthe heart with a knife; and had it not been that he was bent on knowing\r\nmore, he would have forthwith given over the confession, and taken\r\nhimself off. However he kept his place, and:--\"How?\" said he to the lady,\r\n\"does not your husband lie with you?\" The lady replied in the\r\naffirmative. \"How, then,\" quoth the husband, \"can the priest also lie\r\nwith you?\" \"Sir,\" replied she, \"what art the priest employs I know not;\r\nbut door there is none, however well locked, in the house, that comes not\r\nopen at his touch; and he tells me that, being come to the door of my\r\nroom, before he opens it, he says certain words, whereby my husband\r\nforthwith falls asleep; whereupon he opens the door, and enters the room,\r\nand lies with me; and so 'tis always, without fail.\" \"Then 'tis very\r\nwrong, Madam, and you must give it up altogether,\" said the husband.\r\n\"That, Sir,\" returned the lady, \"I doubt I can never do; for I love him\r\ntoo much.\" \"In that case,\" quoth the husband, \"I cannot give you\r\nabsolution.\" \"The pity of it!\" ejaculated the lady; \"I came not hither to\r\ntell you falsehoods: if I could give it up, I would.\" \"Madam,\" replied\r\nthe husband, \"indeed I am sorry for you; for I see that you are in a fair\r\nway to lose your soul. However, this I will do for you; I will make\r\nspecial supplication to God on your behalf; and perchance you may be\r\nprofited thereby. And from time to time I will send you one of my young\r\nclerks; and you will tell him whether my prayers have been of any help to\r\nyou, or no, and if they have been so, I shall know what to do next.\"\r\n\"Nay, Sir,\" quoth the lady, \"do not so; send no man to me at home; for,\r\nshould my husband come to know it, he is so jealous that nothing in the\r\nworld would ever disabuse him of the idea that he came but for an evil\r\npurpose, and so I should have no peace with him all the year long.\"\r\nMadam, returned the husband, \"have no fear; rest assured that I will so\r\norder matters that you shall never hear a word about it from him.\" \"If\r\nyou can make sure of that,\" quoth the lady, \"I have no more to say.\" And\r\nso, her confession ended, and her penance enjoined, she rose, and went to\r\nmass, while the luckless husband, fuming and fretting, hasted to divest\r\nhimself of his priest's trappings, and then went home bent upon devising\r\nsome means to bring the priest and his wife together, and take his\r\nrevenge upon them both.\r\n\r\nWhen the lady came home from church she read in her husband's face that\r\nshe had spoiled his Christmas for him, albeit he dissembled to the\r\nuttermost, lest she should discover what he had done, and supposed\r\nhimself to have learned. His mind was made up to keep watch for the\r\npriest that very night by his own front door. So to the lady he said:--\"I\r\nhave to go out to-night to sup and sleep; so thou wilt take care that the\r\nfront door, and the mid-stair door, and the bedroom door are well locked;\r\nand for the rest thou mayst go to bed, at thine own time.\" \"Well and\r\ngood,\" replied the lady: and as soon as she was able, off she hied her to\r\nthe aperture, and gave the wonted signal, which Filippo no sooner heard,\r\nthan he was at the spot. The lady then told him what she had done in the\r\nmorning, and what her husband had said to her after breakfast,\r\nadding:--\"Sure I am that he will not stir out of the house, but will keep\r\nwatch beside the door; wherefore contrive to come in to-night by the\r\nroof, that we may be together.\" \"Madam,\" replied the gallant, nothing\r\nloath, \"trust me for that.\"\r\n\r\nNight came, the husband armed, and noiselessly hid himself in a room on\r\nthe ground floor: the lady locked all the doors, being especially careful\r\nto secure the mid-stair door, to bar her husband's ascent; and in due\r\ntime the gallant, having found his way cautiously enough over the roof,\r\nthey got them to bed, and there had solace of one another and a good\r\ntime; and at daybreak the gallant hied him back to his house. Meanwhile\r\nthe husband, rueful and supperless, half dead with cold, kept his armed\r\nwatch beside his door, momently expecting the priest, for the best part\r\nof the night; but towards daybreak, his powers failing him, he lay down\r\nand slept in the ground-floor room. 'Twas hard upon tierce when he awoke,\r\nand the front door was then open; so, making as if he had just come in,\r\nhe went upstairs and breakfasted. Not long afterwards he sent to his wife\r\na young fellow, disguised as the priest's underling, who asked her if he\r\nof whom she wist had been with her again. The lady, who quite understood\r\nwhat that meant, made answer that he had not come that night, and that,\r\nif he continued to neglect her so, 'twas possible he might be forgotten,\r\nthough she had no mind to forget him.\r\n\r\nNow, to make a long story short, the husband passed many a night in the\r\nsame way, hoping to catch the priest as he came in, the lady and her\r\ngallant meanwhile having a good time. But at last the husband, being able\r\nto stand it no longer, sternly demanded of his wife what she had said to\r\nthe priest the morning when she was confessed. The lady answered that she\r\nwas not minded to tell him, for that 'twas not seemly or proper so to do.\r\nWhereupon:--\"Sinful woman,\" quoth the husband, \"in thy despite I know\r\nwhat thou saidst to him, and know I must and will who this priest is, of\r\nwhom thou art enamoured, and who by dint of his incantations lies with\r\nthee a nights, or I will sluice thy veins for thee.\" \"'Tis not true,\"\r\nreplied the lady, \"that I am enamoured of a priest.\" \"How?\" quoth the\r\nhusband, \"saidst thou not as much to the priest that confessed thee?\"\r\n\"Thou canst not have had it from him,\" rejoined the lady. \"Wast thou then\r\npresent thyself? For sure I never told him so.\" \"Then tell me,\" quoth the\r\nhusband, \"who this priest is; and lose no time about it.\" Whereat the\r\nlady began to smile, and:--\"I find it not a little diverting,\" quoth she,\r\n\"that a wise man should suffer himself to be led by a simple woman as a\r\nram is led by the horns to the shambles; albeit no wise man art thou: not\r\nsince that fatal hour when thou gavest harbourage in thy breast, thou\r\nwist not why, to the evil spirit of jealousy; and the more foolish and\r\ninsensate thou art, the less glory have I. Deemest thou, my husband, that\r\nI am as blind of the bodily eye as thou art of the mind's eye? Nay, but\r\nfor sure I am not so. I knew at a glance the priest that confessed me,\r\nand that 'twas even thyself. But I was minded to give thee that of which\r\nthou wast in quest, and I gave it thee. Howbeit, if thou hadst been the\r\nwise man thou takest thyself to be, thou wouldst not have chosen such a\r\nway as that to worm out thy good lady's secrets, nor wouldst thou have\r\nfallen a prey to a baseless suspicion, but wouldst have understood that\r\nwhat she confessed was true, and she all the while guiltless. I told thee\r\nthat I loved a priest; and wast not thou, whom I love, though ill enough\r\ndost thou deserve it, turned priest? I told thee that there was no door\r\nin my house but would open when he was minded to lie with me: and when\r\nthou wouldst fain have access to me, what door was ever closed against\r\nthee? I told thee that the priest lay nightly with me: and what night was\r\nthere that thou didst not lie with me? Thou sentest thy young clerk to\r\nme: and thou knowest that, as often as thou hadst not been with me, I\r\nsent word that the priest had not been with me. Who but thou, that hast\r\nsuffered jealousy to blind thee, would have been so witless as not to\r\nread such a riddle? But thou must needs mount guard at night beside the\r\ndoor, and think to make me believe that thou hadst gone out to sup and\r\nsleep. Consider thy ways, and court not the mockery of those that know\r\nthem as I do, but turn a man again as thou wast wont to be: and let there\r\nbe no more of this strict restraint in which thou keepest me; for I swear\r\nto thee by God that, if I were minded to set horns on thy brow, I should\r\nnot fail so to take my pastime that thou wouldst never find it out,\r\nthough thou hadst a hundred eyes, as thou hast but two.\"\r\n\r\nThus admonished, the jealous caitiff, who had flattered himself that he\r\nhad very cunningly discovered his wife's secret, was ashamed, and made no\r\nanswer save to commend his wife's wit and honour; and thus, having cause\r\nfor jealousy, he discarded it, as he had erstwhile been jealous without\r\ncause. And so the adroit lady had, as it were, a charter of indulgence,\r\nand needed no more to contrive for her lover to come to her over the roof\r\nlike a cat, but admitted him by the door, and using due discretion, had\r\nmany a good time with him, and sped her life gaily.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VI.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMadonna Isabella has with her Leonetto, her accepted lover, when she is\r\nsurprised by one Messer Lambertuccio, by whom she is beloved: her husband\r\ncoming home about the same time, she sends Messer Lambertuccio forth of\r\nthe house drawn sword in hand, and the husband afterwards escorts\r\nLeonetto home.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWondrous was the delight that all the company had of Fiammetta's story,\r\nnor was there any but affirmed that the lady had done excellent well, and\r\ndealt with her insensate husband as he deserved. However, it being ended,\r\nthe king bade Pampinea follow suit; which she did on this wise:--Not a\r\nfew there are that in their simplicity aver that Love deranges the mind,\r\ninsomuch that whoso loves becomes as it were witless: the folly of which\r\nopinion, albeit I doubt it not, and deem it abundantly proven by what has\r\nbeen already said, I purpose once again to demonstrate.\r\n\r\nIn our city, rich in all manner of good things, there dwelt a young\r\ngentlewoman, fair exceedingly, and wedded to a most worthy and excellent\r\ngentleman. And as it not seldom happens that one cannot keep ever to the\r\nsame diet, but would fain at times vary it, so this lady, finding her\r\nhusband not altogether to her mind, became enamoured of a gallant,\r\nLeonetto by name, who, though of no high rank, was not a little debonair\r\nand courteous, and he in like manner fell in love with her; and (as you\r\nknow that 'tis seldom that what is mutually desired fails to come about)\r\n'twas not long before they had fruition of their love. Now the lady\r\nbeing, as I said, fair and winsome, it so befell that a gentleman, Messer\r\nLambertuccio by name, grew mightily enamoured of her, but so tiresome and\r\nodious did she find him, that for the world she could not bring herself\r\nto love him. So, growing tired of fruitlessly soliciting her favour by\r\nambassage, Messer Lambertuccio, who was a powerful signior, sent her at\r\nlast another sort of message in which he threatened to defame her if she\r\ncomplied not with his wishes. Wherefore the lady, knowing her man, was\r\nterrified, and disposed herself to pleasure him.\r\n\r\nNow it so chanced that Madonna Isabella, for such was the lady's name,\r\nbeing gone, as is our Florentine custom in the summer, to spend some time\r\non a very goodly estate that she had in the contado, one morning finding\r\nherself alone, for her husband had ridden off to tarry some days\r\nelsewhere, she sent for Leonetto to come and keep her company; and\r\nLeonetto came forthwith in high glee. But while they were together,\r\nMesser Lambertuccio, who, having got wind that the husband was away, had\r\nmounted his horse and ridden thither quite alone, knocked at the door.\r\nWhereupon the lady's maid hied her forthwith to her mistress, who was\r\nalone with Leonetto, and called her, saying:--\"Madam, Messer Lambertuccio\r\nis here below, quite alone.\" Whereat the lady was vexed beyond measure;\r\nand being also not a little dismayed, she said to Leonetto:--\"Prithee,\r\nlet it not irk thee to withdraw behind the curtain, and there keep close\r\nuntil Messer Lambertuccio be gone.\" Leonetto, who stood in no less fear\r\nof Messer Lambertuccio than did the lady, got into his hiding-place; and\r\nthe lady bade the maid go open to Messer Lambertuccio: she did so; and\r\nhaving dismounted and fastened his palfrey to a pin, he ascended the\r\nstairs; at the head of which the lady received him with a smile and as\r\ngladsome a greeting as she could find words for, and asked him on what\r\nerrand he was come. The gentleman embraced and kissed her, saying:--\"My\r\nsoul, I am informed that your husband is not here, and therefore I am\r\ncome to stay a while with you.\" Which said, they went into the room, and\r\nlocked them in, and Messer Lambertuccio fell a toying with her.\r\n\r\nNow, while thus he sped the time with her, it befell that the lady's\r\nhusband, albeit she nowise expected him, came home, and, as he drew nigh\r\nthe palace, was observed by the maid, who forthwith ran to the lady's\r\nchamber, and said:--\"Madam, the master will be here anon; I doubt he is\r\nalready in the courtyard.\" Whereupon, for that she had two men in the\r\nhouse, and the knight's palfrey, that was in the courtyard, made it\r\nimpossible to hide him, the lady gave herself up for dead. Nevertheless\r\nshe made up her mind on the spur of the moment, and springing out of bed\r\n\"Sir,\" quoth she to Messer Lambertuccio, \"if you have any regard for me,\r\nand would save my life, you will do as I bid you: that is to say, you\r\nwill draw your blade, and put on a fell and wrathful countenance, and hie\r\nyou downstairs, saying:--'By God, he shall not escape me elsewhere.' And\r\nif my husband would stop you, or ask you aught, say nought but what I\r\nhave told you, and get you on horseback and tarry with him on no\r\naccount.\" \"To hear is to obey,\" quoth Messer Lambertuccio, who, with the\r\nflush of his recent exertion and the rage that he felt at the husband's\r\nreturn still on his face, and drawn sword in hand, did as she bade him.\r\nThe lady's husband, being now dismounted in the courtyard, and not a\r\nlittle surprised to see the palfrey there, was about to go up the stairs,\r\nwhen he saw Messer Lambertuccio coming down them, and marvelling both at\r\nhis words and at his mien:--\"What means this, Sir?\" quoth he. But Messer\r\nLambertuccio clapped foot in stirrup, and mounted, saying nought\r\nbut:--\"Zounds, but I will meet him elsewhere;\" and so he rode off.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman then ascended the stairs, at the head of which he found his\r\nlady distraught with terror, to whom he said:--\"What manner of thing is\r\nthis? After whom goes Messer Lambertuccio, so wrathful and menacing?\"\r\nWhereto the lady, drawing nigher the room, that Leonetto might hear her,\r\nmade answer:--\"Never, Sir, had I such a fright as this. There came\r\nrunning in here a young man, who to me is quite a stranger, and at his\r\nheels Messer Lambertuccio with a drawn sword in his hand; and as it\r\nhappened the young man found the door of this room open, and trembling in\r\nevery limb, cried out:--'Madam, your succour, for God's sake, that I die\r\nnot in your arms.' So up I got, and would have asked him who he was, and\r\nhow bested, when up came Messer Lambertuccio, exclaiming:--'Where art\r\nthou, traitor?' I planted myself in the doorway, and kept him from\r\nentering, and seeing that I was not minded to give him admittance, he was\r\ncourteous enough, after not a little parley, to take himself off, as you\r\nsaw.\" Whereupon:--\"Wife,\" quoth the husband, \"thou didst very right.\r\nGreat indeed had been the scandal, had some one been slain here, and\r\n'twas a gross affront on Messer Lambertuccio's part to pursue a fugitive\r\nwithin the house.\" He then asked where the young man was. Whereto the\r\nlady answered:--\"Nay, where he may be hiding, Sir, I wot not.\"\r\nSo:--\"Where art thou?\" quoth the knight. \"Fear not to shew thyself.\" Then\r\nforth of his hiding-place, all of a tremble, for in truth he had been\r\nthoroughly terrified, crept Leonetto, who had heard all that had passed.\r\nTo whom:--\"What hast thou to do with Messer Lambertuccio?\" quoth the\r\nknight. \"Nothing in the world,\" replied the young man: \"wherefore, I\r\ndoubt he must either be out of his mind, or have mistaken me for another;\r\nfor no sooner had he sight of me in the street hard by the palace, than\r\nhe laid his hand on his sword, and exclaimed:--'Traitor, thou art a dead\r\nman.' Whereupon I sought not to know why, but fled with all speed, and\r\ngot me here, and so, thanks to God and this gentlewoman, I escaped his\r\nhands.\" \"Now away with thy fears,\" quoth the knight; \"I will see thee\r\nhome safe and sound; and then 'twill be for thee to determine how thou\r\nshalt deal with him.\" And so, when they had supped, he set him on\r\nhorseback, and escorted him to Florence, and left him not until he was\r\nsafe in his own house. And the very same evening, following the lady's\r\ninstructions, Leonetto spoke privily with Messer Lambertuccio, and so\r\ncomposed the affair with him, that, though it occasioned not a little\r\ntalk, the knight never wist how he had been tricked by his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nLodovico discovers to Madonna Beatrice the love that he bears her: she\r\nsends Egano, her husband, into a garden disguised as herself, and lies\r\nwith Lodovico; who thereafter, being risen, hies him to the garden and\r\ncudgels Egano.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThis device of Madonna Isabella, thus recounted by Pampinea, was held\r\nnothing short of marvellous by all the company. But, being bidden by the\r\nking to tell the next story, thus spake Filomena:--Loving ladies, if I\r\nmistake not, the device, of which you shall presently hear from me, will\r\nprove to be no less excellent than the last.\r\n\r\nYou are to know, then, that there dwelt aforetime at Paris a Florentine\r\ngentleman, who, being by reason of poverty turned merchant, had prospered\r\nso well in his affairs that he was become very wealthy; and having by his\r\nlady an only son, Lodovico by name, whose nobility disrelished trade, he\r\nwould not put him in any shop; but that he might be with other gentlemen,\r\nhe caused him to enter the service of the King of France, whereby he\r\nacquired very fine manners and other accomplishments. Being in this\r\nservice, Lodovico was one day with some other young gallants that talked\r\nof the fair ladies of France, and England, and other parts of the world,\r\nwhen they were joined by certain knights that were returned from the Holy\r\nSepulchre; and hearing their discourse, one of the knights fell a saying,\r\nthat of a surety in the whole world, so far as he had explored it, there\r\nwas not any lady, of all that he had ever seen, that might compare for\r\nbeauty with Madonna Beatrice, the wife of Egano de' Galluzzi, of Bologna:\r\nwherein all his companions, who in common with him had seen the lady at\r\nBologna, concurred. Which report Lodovico, who was as yet fancy-free, no\r\nsooner heard, than he burned with such a yearning to see the lady that he\r\nwas able to think of nought else: insomuch that he made up his mind to\r\nbetake him to Bologna to see her, and if she pleased him, to remain\r\nthere; to which end he gave his father to understand that he would fain\r\nvisit the Holy Sepulchre, whereto his father after no little demur\r\nconsented.\r\n\r\nSo to Bologna Anichino--for so he now called himself--came; and, as\r\nFortune would have it, the very next day, he saw the lady at a festal\r\ngathering, and deemed her vastly more beautiful than he had expected:\r\nwherefore he waxed most ardently enamoured of her, and resolved never to\r\nquit Bologna, until he had gained her love. So, casting about how he\r\nshould proceed, he could devise no other way but to enter her husband's\r\nservice, which was the more easy that he kept not a few retainers: on\r\nthis wise Lodovico surmised that, peradventure, he might compass his end.\r\nHe therefore sold his horses and meetly bestowed his servants, bidding\r\nthem make as if they knew him not; and being pretty familiar with his\r\nhost, he told him that he was minded to take service with some worthy\r\nlord, it any such he might find. \"Thou wouldst make,\" quoth the host,\r\n\"the very sort of retainer to suit a gentleman of this city, Egano by\r\nname, who keeps not a few of them, and will have all of them presentable\r\nlike thee: I will mention the matter to him.\" And so he accordingly did,\r\nand before he took leave of Egano had placed Anichino with him, to\r\nEgano's complete satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBeing thus resident with Egano, and having abundant opportunities of\r\nseeing the fair lady, Anichino set himself to serve Egano with no little\r\nzeal; wherein he succeeded so well, that Egano was more than satisfied,\r\ninsomuch that by and by there was nought he could do without his advice,\r\nand he entrusted to him the guidance not only of himself, but of all his\r\naffairs. Now it so befell that one day when Egano was gone a hawking,\r\nhaving left Anichino at home, Madonna Beatrice, who as yet wist not of\r\nhis love, albeit she had from time to time taken note of him and his\r\nmanners, and had not a little approved and commended them, sat herself\r\ndown with him to a game of chess, which, to please her, Anichino most\r\ndexterously contrived to lose, to the lady's prodigious delight. After a\r\nwhile, the lady's women, one and all, gave over watching their play, and\r\nleft them to it; whereupon Anichino heaved a mighty sigh. The lady,\r\nlooking hard at him, said:--\"What ails thee, Anichino? Is it, then, such\r\na mortification to thee to be conquered by me?\" \"Nay, Madam,\" replied\r\nAnichino, \"my sigh was prompted by a much graver matter.\" \"Then, if thou\r\nhast any regard for me,\" quoth the lady, \"tell me what it is.\" Hearing\r\nhimself thus adjured by \"any regard\" he had for her whom he loved more\r\nthan aught else, Anichino heaved a yet mightier sigh, which caused the\r\nlady to renew her request that he would be pleased to tell her the\r\noccasion of his sighs. Whereupon:--\"Madam,\" said Anichino, \"I greatly\r\nfear me, that, were I to tell it you, 'twould but vex you; and, moreover,\r\nI doubt you might repeat it to some one else.\" \"Rest assured,\" returned\r\nthe lady, \"that I shall neither be annoyed, nor, without thy leave, ever\r\nrepeat to any other soul aught that thou mayst say.\" \"Then,\" said\r\nAnichino, \"having this pledge from you, I will tell it you.\" And, while\r\nthe tears all but stood in his eyes, he told her, who he was, the report\r\nhe had heard of her, and where and how he had become enamoured of her,\r\nand with what intent he had taken service with her husband: after which,\r\nhe humbly besought her, that, if it might be, she would have pity on him,\r\nand gratify this his secret and ardent desire; and that, if she were not\r\nminded so to do, she would suffer him to retain his place there, and love\r\nher. Ah! Bologna! how sweetly mixed are the elements in thy women! How\r\ncommendable in such a case are they all! No delight have they in sighs\r\nand tears, but are ever inclinable to prayers, and ready to yield to the\r\nsolicitations of Love. Had I but words apt to praise them as they\r\ndeserve, my eloquence were inexhaustible.\r\n\r\nThe gentlewoman's gaze was fixed on Anichino as he spoke; she made no\r\ndoubt that all he said was true, and yielding to his appeal, she\r\nentertained his love within her heart in such measure that she too began\r\nto sigh, and after a sigh or two made answer:--\"Sweet my Anichino, be of\r\ngood cheer; neither presents nor promises, nor any courting by gentleman,\r\nor lord, or whoso else (for I have been and am still courted by not a\r\nfew) was ever able to sway my soul to love any of them: but thou, by the\r\nfew words that thou hast said, hast so wrought with me that, brief though\r\nthe time has been, I am already in far greater measure thine than mine.\r\nMy love I deem thee to have won right worthily; and so I give it thee,\r\nand vow to give thee joyance thereof before the coming night be past. To\r\nwhich end thou wilt come to my room about midnight; I will leave the door\r\nopen; thou knowest the side of the bed on which I sleep; thou wilt come\r\nthere; should I be asleep, thou hast but to touch me, and I shall awake,\r\nand give thee solace of thy long-pent desire. In earnest whereof I will\r\neven give thee a kiss.\" So saying, she threw her arms about his neck, and\r\nlovingly kissed him, as Anichino her.\r\n\r\nTheir colloquy thus ended, Anichino betook him elsewhere about some\r\nmatters which he had to attend to, looking forward to midnight with\r\nboundless exultation. Egano came in from his hawking; and after supper,\r\nbeing weary, went straight to bed, whither the lady soon followed him,\r\nleaving, as she had promised, the door of the chamber open. Thither\r\naccordingly, at the appointed hour, came Anichino, and having softly\r\nentered the chamber, and closed the door behind him, stole up to where\r\nthe lady lay, and laying his hand upon her breast, found that she was\r\nawake. Now, as soon as she wist that Anichino was come, she took his hand\r\nin both her own; and keeping fast hold of him, she turned about in the\r\nbed, until she awoke Egano; whereupon:--\"Husband,\" quoth she, \"I would\r\nnot say aught of this to thee, yestereve, because I judged thou wast\r\nweary; but tell me, upon thy hope of salvation, Egano, whom deemest thou\r\nthy best and most loyal retainer, and the most attached to thee, of all\r\nthat thou hast in the house?\" \"What a question is this, wife?\" returned\r\nEgano. \"Dost not know him? Retainer I have none, nor ever had, so\r\ntrusted, or loved, as Anichino. But wherefore put such a question?\"\r\n\r\nNow, when Anichino wist that Egano was awake, and heard them talk of\r\nhimself, he more than once tried to withdraw his hand, being mightily\r\nafraid lest the lady meant to play him false; but she held it so tightly\r\nthat he might not get free, while thus she made answer to Egano:--\"I will\r\ntell thee what he is. I thought that he was all thou sayst, and that none\r\nwas so loyal to thee as he, but he has undeceived me, for that yesterday,\r\nwhen thou wast out a hawking, he, being here, chose his time, and had the\r\nshamelessness to crave of me compliance with his wanton desires: and I,\r\nthat I might not need other evidence than that of thine own senses to\r\nprove his guilt to thee, I made answer, that I was well content, and that\r\nto-night, after midnight, I would get me into the garden, and await him\r\nthere at the foot of the pine. Now go thither I shall certainly not; but,\r\nif thou wouldst prove the loyalty of thy retainer, thou canst readily do\r\nso, if thou but slip on one of my loose robes, and cover thy face with a\r\nveil, and go down and attend his coming, for come, I doubt not, he will.\"\r\nWhereto Egano:--\"Meet indeed it is,\" quoth he, \"that I should go see;\"\r\nand straightway up he got, and, as best he might in the dark, he put on\r\none of the lady's loose robes and veiled his face, and then hied him to\r\nthe garden, and sate down at the foot of the pine to await Anichino. The\r\nlady no sooner wist that he was out of the room, than she rose, and\r\nlocked the door. Anichino, who had never been so terrified in all his\r\nlife, and had struggled with all his might to disengage his hand from the\r\nlady's clasp, and had inwardly cursed her and his love, and himself for\r\ntrusting her, a hundred thousand times, was overjoyed beyond measure at\r\nthis last turn that she had given the affair. And so, the lady having got\r\nher to bed again, and he, at her bidding, having stripped and laid him\r\ndown beside her, they had solace and joyance of one another for a good\r\nwhile. Then, the lady, deeming it unmeet for Anichino to tarry longer\r\nwith her, caused him to get up and resume his clothes, saying to\r\nhim:--\"Sweet my mouth, thou wilt take a stout cudgel, and get thee to the\r\ngarden, and making as if I were there, and thy suit to me had been but to\r\ntry me, thou wilt give Egano a sound rating with thy tongue and a sound\r\nbelabouring with thy cudgel, the sequel whereof will be wondrously\r\ngladsome and delightful.\" Whereupon Anichino hied him off to the garden,\r\narmed with a staff of wild willow; and as he drew nigh the pine, Egano\r\nsaw him, and rose and came forward to meet him as if he would receive him\r\nwith the heartiest of cheer. But:--\"Ah! wicked woman!\" quoth Anichino;\r\n\"so thou art come! Thou didst verily believe, then, that I was, that I\r\nam, minded thus to wrong my lord? Foul fall thee a thousand times!\" And\r\ntherewith he raised his cudgel, and began to lay about him. Egano,\r\nhowever, had heard and seen enough, and without a word took to flight,\r\nwhile Anichino pursued him, crying out:--\"Away with thee! God send thee a\r\nbad year, lewd woman that thou art; nor doubt that Egano shall hear of\r\nthis to-morrow.\" Egano, having received sundry round knocks, got him back\r\nto his chamber with what speed he might; and being asked by the lady,\r\nwhether Anichino had come into the garden:--\"Would to God he had not!\"\r\nquoth he, \"for that, taking me for thee, he has beaten me black and blue\r\nwith his cudgel, and rated me like the vilest woman that ever was:\r\npassing strange, indeed, it had seemed to me that he should have said\r\nthose words to thee with intent to dishonour me; and now 'tis plain that\r\n'twas but that, seeing thee so blithe and frolicsome, he was minded to\r\nprove thee.\" Whereto:--\"God be praised,\" returned the lady, \"that he\r\nproved me by words, as thee by acts: and I doubt not he may say that I\r\nbear his words with more patience than thou his acts. But since he is so\r\nloyal to thee, we must make much of him and do him honour.\" \"Ay, indeed,\"\r\nquoth Egano, \"thou sayst sooth.\"\r\n\r\nThus was Egano fortified in the belief that never had any gentleman wife\r\nso true, or retainer so loyal, as he; and many a hearty laugh had he with\r\nAnichino and his lady over this affair, which to them was the occasion\r\nthat, with far less let than might else have been, they were able to have\r\nsolace and joyance of one another, so long as it pleased Anichino to\r\ntarry at Bologna.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VIII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nA husband grows jealous of his wife, and discovers that she has warning\r\nof her lover's approach by a piece of pack-thread, which she ties to her\r\ngreat toe a nights. While he is pursuing her lover, she puts another\r\nwoman in bed in her place. The husband, finding her there, beats her, and\r\ncuts off her hair. He then goes and calls his wife's brothers, who,\r\nholding his accusation to be false, give him a rating.\r\n--\r\n\r\nRare indeed was deemed by common consent the subtlety shewn by Madonna\r\nBeatrice in the beguilement of her husband, and all affirmed that the\r\nterror of Anichino must have been prodigious, when, the lady still\r\nkeeping fast hold of him, he had heard her say that he had made suit of\r\nlove to her. However, Filomena being silent, the king turned to Neifile,\r\nsaying:--\"'Tis now for you to tell.\" Whereupon Neifile, while a slight\r\nsmile died away upon her lips, thus began:--Fair ladies, to entertain you\r\nwith a goodly story, such as those which my predecessors have delighted\r\nyou withal, is indeed a heavy burden, but, God helping me, I trust fairly\r\nwell to acquit myself thereof.\r\n\r\nYou are to know, then, that there dwelt aforetime in our city a most\r\nwealthy merchant, Arriguccio Berlinghieri by name, who foolishly, as we\r\nwot by daily experience is the way of merchants, thinking to compass\r\ngentility by matrimony, took to wife a young gentlewoman, by no means\r\nsuited to him, whose name was Monna Sismonda. Now Monna Sismonda, seeing\r\nthat her husband was much abroad, and gave her little of his company,\r\nbecame enamoured of a young gallant, Ruberto by name, who had long\r\ncourted her: and she being grown pretty familiar with him, and using,\r\nperchance, too little discretion, for she affected him extremely, it so\r\nbefell that Arriguccio, whether it was that he detected somewhat, or\r\nhowsoever, waxed of all men the most jealous, and gave up going abroad,\r\nand changed his way of life altogether, and made it his sole care to\r\nwatch over his wife, insomuch that he never allowed himself a wink of\r\nsleep until he had seen her to bed: which occasioned the lady the most\r\ngrievous dumps, because 'twas on no wise possible for her to be with her\r\nRuberto. So, casting about in many ways how she might contrive to meet\r\nhim, and being thereto not a little plied by Ruberto himself, she\r\nbethought her at last of the following expedient: to wit, her room\r\nfronting the street, and Arriguccio, as she had often observed, being\r\nvery hard put to it to get him to sleep, but thereafter sleeping very\r\nsoundly, she resolved to arrange with Ruberto that he should come to the\r\nfront door about midnight, whereupon she would get her down, and open the\r\ndoor, and stay some time with him while her husband was in his deep\r\nsleep. And that she might have tidings of his arrival, yet so as that\r\nnone else might wot aught thereof, she adopted the device of lowering a\r\npack-thread from the bedroom window on such wise that, while with one end\r\nit should all but touch the ground, it should traverse the floor of the\r\nroom, until it reached the bed, and then be brought under the clothes, so\r\nthat, when she was abed, she might attach it to her great toe. Having so\r\ndone, she sent word to Ruberto, that when he came, he must be sure to\r\njerk the pack-thread, and, if her husband were asleep, she would loose\r\nit, and go open to him; but, if he were awake, she would hold it taut and\r\ndraw it to herself, to let him know that he must not expect her. Ruberto\r\nfell in with the idea, came there many times, and now forgathered with\r\nher and again did not. But at last, they still using this cunning\r\npractice, it so befell that one night, while the lady slept, Arriguccio,\r\nletting his foot stray more than he was wont about the bed, came upon the\r\npack-thread, and laying his hand upon it, found that it was attached to\r\nhis lady's great toe, and said to himself:--This must be some trick: and\r\nafterwards discovering that the thread passed out of the window, was\r\nconfirmed in his surmise. Wherefore, he softly severed it from the lady's\r\ntoe, and affixed it to his own; and waited, all attention, to learn the\r\nresult of his experiment. Nor had he long to wait before Ruberto came,\r\nand Arriguccio felt him jerk the thread according to his wont: and as\r\nArriguccio had not known how to attach the thread securely, and Ruberto\r\njerked it with some force, it gave way, whereby he understood that he was\r\nto wait, and did so. Arriguccio straightway arose, caught up his arms,\r\nand hasted to the door to see who might be there, intent to do him a\r\nmischief. Now Arriguccio, for all he was a merchant, was a man of spirit,\r\nand of thews and sinews; and being come to the door, he opened it by no\r\nmeans gingerly, as the lady was wont; whereby Ruberto, who was in\r\nwaiting, surmised the truth, to wit, that 'twas Arriguccio by whom the\r\ndoor was opened. Wherefore he forthwith took to flight, followed by\r\nArriguccio. But at length, when he had run a long way, as Arriguccio gave\r\nnot up the pursuit, he being also armed, drew his sword, and faced about;\r\nand so they fell to, Arriguccio attacking, and Ruberto defending himself.\r\n\r\nNow when Arriguccio undid the bedroom door, the lady awoke, and finding\r\nthe pack-thread cut loose from her toe, saw at a glance that her trick\r\nwas discovered; and hearing Arriguccio running after Ruberto, she\r\nforthwith got up, foreboding what the result was like to be, and called\r\nher maid, who was entirely in her confidence: whom she so plied with her\r\nobsecrations that at last she got her into bed in her room, beseeching\r\nher not to say who she was, but to bear patiently all the blows that\r\nArriguccio might give her; and she would so reward her that she should\r\nhave no reason to complain. Then, extinguishing the light that was in the\r\nroom, forth she hied her, and having found a convenient hiding-place in\r\nthe house, awaited the turn of events. Now Arriguccio and Ruberto being\r\nhotly engaged in the street, the neighbours, roused by the din of the\r\ncombat, got up and launched their curses upon them. Wherefore Arriguccio,\r\nfearing lest he should be recognized, drew off before he had so much as\r\ndiscovered who the young gallant was, or done him any scathe, and in a\r\nfell and wrathful mood betook him home. Stumbling into the bedroom, he\r\ncried out angrily:--\"Where art thou, lewd woman? Thou hast put out the\r\nlight, that I may not be able to find thee; but thou hast miscalculated.\"\r\nAnd going to the bedside, he laid hold of the maid, taking her to be his\r\nwife, and fell a pummelling and kicking her with all the strength he had\r\nin his hands and feet, insomuch that he pounded her face well-nigh to\r\npulp, rating her the while like the vilest woman that ever was; and last\r\nof all he cut off her hair. The maid wept bitterly, as indeed she well\r\nmight; and though from time to time she ejaculated an \"Alas! Mercy, for\r\nGod's sake!\" or \"Spare me, spare me;\" yet her voice was so broken by her\r\nsobs, and Arriguccio's hearing so dulled by his wrath, that he was not\r\nable to discern that 'twas not his wife's voice but that of another\r\nwoman. So, having soundly thrashed her, and cut off her hair, as we\r\nsaid:--\"Wicked woman,\" quoth he, \"I touch thee no more; but I go to find\r\nthy brothers, and shall do them to wit of thy good works; and then they\r\nmay come here, and deal with thee as they may deem their honour demands,\r\nand take thee hence, for be sure thou shalt no more abide in this house.\"\r\nWith this he was gone, locking the door of the room behind him, and\r\nquitted the house alone.\r\n\r\nNow no sooner did Monna Sismonda, who had heard all that passed, perceive\r\nthat her husband was gone, than she opened the door of the bedroom,\r\nrekindled the light, and finding her maid all bruises and tears, did what\r\nshe could to comfort her, and carried her back to her own room, where,\r\ncausing her to be privily waited on and tended, she helped her so\r\nliberally from Arriguccio's own store, that she confessed herself\r\ncontent. The maid thus bestowed in her room, the lady presently hied her\r\nback to her own, which she set all in neat and trim order, remaking the\r\nbed, so that it might appear as if it had not been slept in, relighting\r\nthe lamp, and dressing and tiring herself, until she looked as if she had\r\nnot been abed that night; then, taking with her a lighted lamp and some\r\nwork, she sat her down at the head of the stairs, and began sewing, while\r\nshe waited to see how the affair would end.\r\n\r\nArriguccio meanwhile had hied him with all speed straight from the house\r\nto that of his wife's brothers, where by dint of much knocking he made\r\nhimself heard, and was admitted. The lady's three brothers, and her\r\nmother, being informed that 'twas Arriguccio, got up, and having set\r\nlights a burning, came to him and asked him on what errand he was come\r\nthere at that hour, and alone. Whereupon Arriguccio, beginning with the\r\ndiscovery of the pack-thread attached to his lady's great toe, gave them\r\nthe whole narrative of his discoveries and doings down to the very end;\r\nand to clinch the whole matter, he put in their hands the locks which he\r\nhad cut, as he believed, from his wife's head, adding that 'twas now for\r\nthem to come for her and deal with her on such wise as they might deem\r\ntheir honour required, seeing that he would nevermore have her in his\r\nhouse. Firmly believing what he told them, the lady's brothers were very\r\nwroth with her, and having provided themselves with lighted torches, set\r\nout with Arriguccio, and hied them to his house with intent to scorn her,\r\nwhile their mother followed, weeping and beseeching now one, now another,\r\nnot to credit these matters so hastily, until they had seen or heard\r\nsomewhat more thereof; for that the husband might have some other reason\r\nto be wroth with her, and having ill-treated her, might have trumped up\r\nthis charge by way of exculpation, adding that, if true, 'twas passing\r\nstrange, for well she knew her daughter, whom she had brought up from her\r\ntenderest years, and much more to the like effect.\r\n\r\nHowever, being come to Arriguccio's house, they entered, and were\r\nmounting the stairs, when Monna Sismonda, hearing them, called out:--\"Who\r\nis there?\" Whereto one of the brothers responded:--\"Lewd woman, thou\r\nshalt soon have cause enough to know who it is.\" \"Now Lord love us!\"\r\nquoth Monna Sismonda, \"what would he be at?\" Then, rising, she greeted\r\nthem with:--\"Welcome, my brothers but what seek ye abroad at this hour,\r\nall three of you?\" They had seen her sitting and sewing with never a sign\r\nof a blow on her face, whereas Arriguccio had averred that he had\r\npummelled her all over: wherefore their first impression was one of\r\nwonder, and refraining the vehemence of their wrath, they asked her what\r\nmight be the truth of the matter which Arriguccio laid to her charge, and\r\nthreatened her with direful consequences, if she should conceal aught.\r\nWhereto the lady:--\"What you would have me tell you,\" quoth she, \"or what\r\nArriguccio may have laid to my charge, that know not I.\" Arriguccio could\r\nbut gaze upon her, as one that had taken leave of his wits, calling to\r\nmind how he had pummelled her about the face times without number, and\r\nscratched it for her, and mishandled her in all manner of ways, and there\r\nhe now saw her with no trace of aught of it all upon her. However, to\r\nmake a long story short, the lady's brothers told her what Arriguccio had\r\ntold them touching the pack-thread and the beating and all the rest of\r\nit. Whereupon the lady turned to him with:--\"Alas, my husband, what is\r\nthis that I hear? Why givest thou me, to thy own great shame, the\r\nreputation of a lewd woman, when such I am not, and thyself the\r\nreputation of a wicked and cruel man, which thou art not? Wast thou ever\r\nto-night, I say not in my company, but so much as in the house until now?\r\nOr when didst thou beat me? For my part I mind me not of it.\" Arriguccio\r\nbegan:--\"How sayst thou, lewd woman? Did we not go to bed together? Did I\r\nnot come back, after chasing thy lover? Did I not give thee bruises not a\r\nfew, and cut thy hair for thee?\" But the lady interrupted him,\r\nsaying:--\"Nay, thou didst not lie here to-night. But leave we this, of\r\nwhich my true words are my sole witness, and pass we to this of the\r\nbeating thou sayst thou gavest me, and how thou didst cut my hair. Never\r\na beating had I from thee, and I bid all that are here, and thee among\r\nthem, look at me, and say if I have any trace of a beating on my person;\r\nnor should I advise thee to dare lay hand upon me; for, by the Holy Rood,\r\nI would spoil thy beauty for thee. Nor didst thou cut my hair, for aught\r\nthat I saw or felt: however, thou didst it, perchance, on such wise that\r\nI was not ware thereof: so let me see whether 'tis cut or no.\" Then,\r\nunveiling herself, she shewed that her hair was uncut and entire.\r\nWherefore her brothers and mother now turned to Arriguccio with:--\"What\r\nmeans this, Arriguccio? This accords not with what thou gavest us to\r\nunderstand thou hadst done; nor know we how thou wilt prove the residue.\"\r\n\r\nArriguccio was lost, as it were, in a dream, and yet he would fain have\r\nspoken; but, seeing that what he had thought to prove was otherwise, he\r\nessayed no reply. So the lady turning to her brothers:--\"I see,\" quoth\r\nshe, \"what he would have: he will not be satisfied unless I do what I\r\nnever would otherwise have done, to wit, give you to know what a pitiful\r\ncaitiff he is; as now I shall not fail to do. I make no manner of doubt\r\nthat, as he has said, even so it befell, and so he did. How, you shall\r\nhear. This worthy man, to whom, worse luck! you gave me to wife, a\r\nmerchant, as he calls himself, and as such would fain have credit, and\r\nwho ought to be more temperate than a religious, and more continent than\r\na girl, lets scarce an evening pass but he goes a boozing in the taverns,\r\nand consorting with this or the other woman of the town; and 'tis for me\r\nto await his return until midnight or sometimes until matins, even as you\r\nnow find me. I doubt not that, being thoroughly well drunk, he got him to\r\nbed with one of these wantons, and, awaking, found the pack-thread on her\r\nfoot, and afterwards did actually perform all these brave exploits of\r\nwhich he speaks, and in the end came back to her, and beat her, and cut\r\nher hair off, and being not yet quite recovered from his debauch,\r\nbelieved, and, I doubt not, still believes, that 'twas I that he thus\r\ntreated; and if you will but scan his face closely, you will see that he\r\nis still half drunk. But, whatever he may have said about me, I would\r\nhave you account it as nothing more than the disordered speech of a tipsy\r\nman; and forgive him as I do.\" Whereupon the lady's mother raised no\r\nsmall outcry, saying:--\"By the Holy Rood, my daughter, this may not be! A\r\ndaughter, such as thou, to be mated with one so unworthy of thee! The\r\npestilent, insensate cur should be slain on the spot! A pretty state of\r\nthings, indeed! Why, he might have picked thee up from the gutter! Now\r\nfoul fall him! but thou shalt no more be vexed with the tedious drivel of\r\na petty dealer in ass's dung, some blackguard, belike, that came hither\r\nfrom the country because he was dismissed the service of some petty\r\nsquire, clad in romagnole, with belfry-breeches, and a pen in his arse,\r\nand for that he has a few pence, must needs have a gentleman's daughter\r\nand a fine lady to wife, and set up a coat of arms, and say:--'I am of\r\nthe such and such,' and 'my ancestors did thus and thus.' Ah! had my sons\r\nbut followed my advice! Thy honour were safe in the house of the Counts\r\nGuidi, where they might have bestowed thee, though thou hadst but a\r\nmorsel of bread to thy dowry: but they must needs give thee to this rare\r\ntreasure, who, though better daughter and more chaste there is none than\r\nthou in Florence, has not blushed this very midnight and in our presence\r\nto call thee a strumpet, as if we knew thee not. God's faith! so I were\r\nhearkened to, he should shrewdly smart for it.\" Then, turning to her\r\nsons, she said:--\"My sons, I told you plainly enough that this ought not\r\nto be. Now, have you heard how your worthy brother-in-law treats your\r\nsister? Petty twopenny trader that he is: were it for me to act, as it is\r\nfor you, after what he has said of her and done to her, nought would\r\nsatisfy or appease me, till I had rid the earth of him. And were I a man,\r\nwho am but a woman, none, other but myself should meddle with the affair.\r\nGod's curse upon him, the woeful, shameless sot!\" Whereupon the young\r\nmen, incensed by what they had seen and heard, turned to Arriguccio, and\r\nafter giving him the soundest rating that ever was bestowed upon caitiff,\r\nconcluded as follows:--\"This once we pardon thee, witting thee to be a\r\ndrunken knave--but as thou holdest thy life dear, have a care that\r\nhenceforth we hear no such tales of thee; for rest assured that if aught\r\nof the kind do reach our ears, we will requite thee for both turns.\"\r\nWhich said, they departed. Arriguccio, standing there like one dazed, not\r\nwitting whether his late doings were actual fact or but a dream, made no\r\nmore words about the matter, but left his wife in peace. Thus did she by\r\nher address not only escape imminent peril, but open a way whereby in\r\ntime to come she was able to gratify her passion to the full without any\r\nfarther fear of her husband.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IX.\r\n\r\n--\r\nLydia, wife of Nicostratus, loves Pyrrhus, who to assure himself thereof,\r\nasks three things of her, all of which she does, and therewithal enjoys\r\nhim in presence of Nicostratus, and makes Nicostratus believe that what\r\nhe saw was not real.\r\n--\r\n\r\nSo diverting did the ladies find Neifile's story that it kept them still\r\nlaughing and talking, though the king, having bidden Pamfilo tell his\r\nstory, had several times enjoined silence upon them. However, as soon as\r\nthey had done, Pamfilo thus began:--Methinks, worshipful ladies, there is\r\nno venture, though fraught with gravest peril, that whoso loves ardently\r\nwill not make: of which truth, exemplified though it has been in stories\r\nnot a few, I purpose to afford you yet more signal proof in one which I\r\nshall tell you; wherein you will hear of a lady who in her enterprises\r\nowed far more to the favour of Fortune than to the guidance of reason:\r\nwherefore I should not advise any of you rashly to follow in her\r\nfootsteps, seeing that Fortune is not always in a kindly mood, nor are\r\nthe eyes of all men equally holden.\r\n\r\nIn Argos, that most ancient city of Achaia, the fame of whose kings of\r\nold time is out of all proportion to its size, there dwelt of yore\r\nNicostratus, a nobleman, to whom, when he was already verging on old age,\r\nFortune gave to wife a great lady, Lydia by name, whose courage matched\r\nher charms. Nicostratus, as suited with his rank and wealth, kept not a\r\nfew retainers and hounds and hawks, and was mightily addicted to the\r\nchase. Among his dependants was a young man named Pyrrhus, a gallant of\r\nno mean accomplishment, and goodly of person and beloved and trusted by\r\nNicostratus above all other. Of whom Lydia grew mighty enamoured,\r\ninsomuch that neither by day nor by night might her thoughts stray from\r\nhim: but, whether it was that Pyrrhus wist not her love, or would have\r\nnone of it, he gave no sign of recognition; whereby the lady's suffering\r\nwaxing more than she could bear, she made up her mind to declare her love\r\nto him; and having a chambermaid, Lusca by name, in whom she placed great\r\ntrust, she called her, and said:--\"Lusca, tokens thou hast had from me of\r\nmy regard that should ensure thy obedience and loyalty; wherefore have a\r\ncare that what I shall now tell thee reach the ears of none but him to\r\nwhom I shall bid thee impart it. Thou seest, Lusca, that I am in the\r\nprime of my youth and lustihead, and have neither lack nor stint of all\r\nsuch things as folk desire, save only, to be brief, that I have one cause\r\nto repine, to wit, that my husband's years so far outnumber my own.\r\nWherefore with that wherein young ladies take most pleasure I am but ill\r\nprovided, and, as my desire is no less than theirs, 'tis now some while\r\nsince I determined that, if Fortune has shewn herself so little friendly\r\nto me by giving me a husband so advanced in years, at least I will not be\r\nmine own enemy by sparing to devise the means whereby my happiness and\r\nhealth may be assured; and that herein, as in all other matters, my joy\r\nmay be complete, I have chosen, thereto to minister by his embraces, our\r\nPyrrhus, deeming him more worthy than any other man, and have so set my\r\nheart upon him that I am ever ill at ease save when he is present either\r\nto my sight or to my mind, insomuch that, unless I forgather with him\r\nwithout delay, I doubt not that 'twill be the death of me. And so, if\r\nthou holdest my life dear, thou wilt shew him my love on such wise as\r\nthou mayst deem best, and make my suit to him that he be pleased to come\r\nto me, when thou shalt go to fetch him.\" \"That gladly will I,\" replied\r\nthe chambermaid; and as soon as she found convenient time and place, she\r\ndrew Pyrrhus apart, and, as best she knew how, conveyed her lady's\r\nmessage to him. Which Pyrrhus found passing strange to hear, for 'twas in\r\ntruth a complete surprise to him, and he doubted the lady did but mean to\r\ntry him. Wherefore he presently, and with some asperity, answered\r\nthus:--\"Lusca, believe I cannot that this message comes from my lady:\r\nhave a care, therefore, what thou sayst, and if, perchance, it does come\r\nfrom her, I doubt she does not mean it; and if perchance, she does mean\r\nit, why, then I am honoured by my lord above what I deserve, and I would\r\nnot for my life do him such a wrong: so have a care never to speak of\r\nsuch matters to me again.\" Lusca, nowise disconcerted by his uncompliant\r\ntone, rejoined:--\"I shall speak to thee, Pyrrhus, of these and all other\r\nmatters, wherewith I may be commissioned by my lady, as often as she\r\nshall bid me, whether it pleases or irks thee; but thou art a blockhead.\"\r\n\r\nSo, somewhat chafed, Lusca bore Pyrrhus' answer back to her lady, who\r\nwould fain have died, when she heard it, and some days afterwards resumed\r\nthe topic, saying:--\"Thou knowest, Lusca, that 'tis not the first stroke\r\nthat fells the oak; wherefore, methinks, thou wert best go back to this\r\nstrange man, who is minded to evince his loyalty at my expense, and\r\nchoosing a convenient time, declare to him all my passion, and do thy\r\nbest endeavour that the affair be carried through; for if it should thus\r\nlapse, 'twould be the death of me; besides which, he would think we had\r\nbut trifled with him, and, whereas 'tis his love we would have, we should\r\nearn his hatred.\" So, after comforting the lady, the maid hied her in\r\nquest of Pyrrhus, whom she found in a gladsome and propitious mood, and\r\nthus addressed:--\"'Tis not many days, Pyrrhus, since I declared to thee\r\nhow ardent is the flame with which thy lady and mine is consumed for love\r\nof thee, and now again I do thee to wit thereof, and that, if thou shalt\r\nnot relent of the harshness that thou didst manifest the other day, thou\r\nmayst rest assured that her life will be short: wherefore I pray thee to\r\nbe pleased to give her solace of her desire, and shouldst thou persist in\r\nthy obduracy, I, that gave thee credit for not a little sense, shall deem\r\nthee a great fool. How flattered thou shouldst be to know thyself beloved\r\nabove all else by a lady so beauteous and high-born! And how indebted\r\nshouldst thou feel thyself to Fortune, seeing that she has in store for\r\nthee a boon so great and so suited to the cravings of thy youth, ay, and\r\nso like to be of service to thee upon occasion of need! Bethink thee, if\r\nthere be any of thine equals whose life is ordered more agreeably than\r\nthine will be if thou but be wise. Which of them wilt thou find so well\r\nfurnished with arms and horses, clothes and money as thou shalt be, if\r\nthou but give my lady thy love? Receive, then, my words with open mind;\r\nbe thyself again; bethink thee that 'tis Fortune's way to confront a man\r\nbut once with smiling mien and open lap, and, if he then accept not her\r\nbounty, he has but himself to blame, if afterward he find himself in\r\nwant, in beggary. Besides which, no such loyalty is demanded between\r\nservants and their masters as between friends and kinsfolk; rather 'tis\r\nfor servants, so far as they may, to behave towards their masters as\r\ntheir masters behave towards them. Thinkest thou, that, if thou hadst a\r\nfair wife or mother or daughter or sister that found favour in\r\nNicostratus' eyes, he would be so scrupulous on the point of loyalty as\r\nthou art disposed to be in regard of his lady? Thou art a fool, if so\r\nthou dost believe. Hold it for certain, that, if blandishments and\r\nsupplications did not suffice, he would, whatever thou mightest think of\r\nit, have recourse to force. Observe we, then, towards them and theirs the\r\nsame rule which they observe towards us and ours. Take the boon that\r\nFortune offers thee; repulse her not; rather go thou to meet her, and\r\nhail her advance; for be sure that, if thou do not so, to say nought of\r\nthy lady's death, which will certainly ensue, thou thyself wilt repent\r\nthee thereof so often that thou wilt be fain of death.\"\r\n\r\nSince he had last seen Lusca, Pyrrhus had repeatedly pondered what she\r\nhad said to him, and had made his mind up that, should she come again, he\r\nwould answer her in another sort, and comply in all respects with the\r\nlady's desires, provided he might be assured that she was not merely\r\nputting him to the proof; wherefore he now made answer:--\"Lo, now, Lusca,\r\nI acknowledge the truth of all that thou sayst; but, on the other hand, I\r\nknow that my lord is not a little wise and wary, and, as he has committed\r\nall his affairs to my charge, I sorely misdoubt me that 'tis with his\r\napprobation, and by his advice, and but to prove me, that Lydia does\r\nthis: wherefore let her do three things which I shall demand of her for\r\nmy assurance, and then there is nought that she shall crave of me, but I\r\nwill certainly render her prompt obedience. Which three things are\r\nthese:--first, let her in Nicostratus' presence kill his fine\r\nsparrow-hawk: then she must send me a lock of Nicostratus' beard, and\r\nlastly one of his best teeth.\" Hard seemed these terms to Lusca, and hard\r\nbeyond measure to the lady, but Love, that great fautor of enterprise,\r\nand master of stratagem, gave her resolution to address herself to their\r\nperformance: wherefore through the chambermaid she sent him word that\r\nwhat he required of her she would do, and that without either reservation\r\nor delay; and therewithal she told him, that, as he deemed Nicostratus so\r\nwise, she would contrive that they should enjoy one another in\r\nNicostratus' presence, and that Nicostratus should believe that 'twas a\r\nmere show. Pyrrhus, therefore, anxiously expected what the lady would do.\r\nSome days thus passed, and then Nicostratus gave a great breakfast, as\r\nwas his frequent wont, to certain gentlemen, and when the tables were\r\nremoved, the lady, robed in green samite, and richly adorned, came forth\r\nof her chamber into the hall wherein they sate, and before the eyes of\r\nPyrrhus and all the rest of the company hied her to the perch, on which\r\nstood the sparrow-hawk that Nicostratus so much prized, and loosed him,\r\nand, as if she were minded to carry him on her hand, took him by the\r\njesses and dashed him against the wall so that he died.\r\nWhereupon:--\"Alas! my lady, what hast thou done?\" exclaimed Nicostratus:\r\nbut she vouchsafed no answer, save that, turning to the gentlemen that\r\nhad sate at meat with him, she said:--\"My lords, ill fitted were I to\r\ntake vengeance on a king that had done me despite, if I lacked the\r\ncourage to be avenged on a sparrow-hawk. You are to know that by this\r\nbird I have long been cheated of all the time that ought to be devoted by\r\ngentlemen to pleasuring their ladies; for with the first streaks of dawn\r\nNicostratus has been up and got him to horse, and hawk on hand hied him\r\nto the champaign to see him fly, leaving me, such as you see me, alone\r\nand ill content abed. For which cause I have oftentimes been minded to do\r\nthat which I have now done, and have only refrained therefrom, that,\r\nbiding my time, I might do it in the presence of men that should judge my\r\ncause justly, as I trust you will do.\" Which hearing, the gentlemen, who\r\ndeemed her affections no less fixed on Nicostratus than her words\r\nimported, broke with one accord into a laugh, and turning to Nicostratus,\r\nwho was sore displeased, fell a saying:--\"Now well done of the lady to\r\navenge her wrongs by the death of the sparrow-hawk!\" and so, the lady\r\nbeing withdrawn to her chamber, they passed the affair off with divers\r\npleasantries, turning the wrath of Nicostratus to laughter.\r\n\r\nPyrrhus, who had witnessed what had passed, said to himself:--Nobly\r\nindeed has my lady begun, and on such wise as promises well for the\r\nfelicity of my love. God grant that she so continue. And even so Lydia\r\ndid: for not many days after she had killed the sparrow-hawk, she, being\r\nwith Nicostratus in her chamber, from caressing passed to toying and\r\ntrifling with him, and he, sportively pulling her by the hair, gave her\r\noccasion to fulfil the second of Pyrrhus' demands; which she did by\r\nnimbly laying hold of one of the lesser tufts of his beard, and, laughing\r\nthe while, plucking it so hard that she tore it out of his chin. Which\r\nNicostratus somewhat resenting:--\"Now what cause hast thou,\" quoth she,\r\n\"to make such a wry face? 'Tis but that I have plucked some half-dozen\r\nhairs from thy beard. Thou didst not feel it as much as did I but now thy\r\ntugging of my hair.\" And so they continued jesting and sporting with one\r\nanother, the lady jealously guarding the tuft that she had torn from the\r\nbeard, which the very same day she sent to her cherished lover. The third\r\ndemand caused the lady more thought; but, being amply endowed with wit,\r\nand powerfully, seconded by Love, she failed not to hit upon an apt\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nNicostratus had in his service two lads, who, being of gentle birth, had\r\nbeen placed with him by their kinsfolk, that they might learn manners,\r\none of whom, when Nicostratus sate at meat, carved before him, while the\r\nother gave him to drink. Both lads Lydia called to her, and gave them to\r\nunderstand that their breath smelt, and admonished them that, when they\r\nwaited on Nicostratus, they should hold their heads as far back as\r\npossible, saying never a word of the matter to any. The lads believing\r\nher, did as she bade them. Whereupon she took occasion to say to\r\nNicostratus:--\"Hast thou marked what these lads do when they wait upon\r\nthee?\" \"Troth, that have I,\" replied Nicostratus; \"indeed I have often\r\nhad it in mind to ask them why they do so.\" \"Nay,\" rejoined the lady,\r\n\"spare thyself the pains; for I can tell thee the reason, which I have\r\nfor some time kept close, lest it should vex thee; but as I now see that\r\nothers begin to be ware of it, it need no longer be withheld from thee.\r\n'Tis for that thy breath stinks shrewdly that they thus avert their heads\r\nfrom thee: 'twas not wont to be so, nor know I why it should be so; and\r\n'tis most offensive when thou art in converse with gentlemen; and\r\ntherefore 'twould be well to find some way of curing it.\" \"I wonder what\r\nit could be,\" returned Nicostratus; \"is it perchance that I have a\r\ndecayed tooth in my jaw?\" \"That may well be,\" quoth Lydia: and taking him\r\nto a window, she caused him open his mouth, and after regarding it on\r\nthis side and that:--\"Oh! Nicostratus,\" quoth she, \"how couldst thou have\r\nendured it so long? Thou hast a tooth here, which, by what I see, is not\r\nonly decayed, but actually rotten throughout; and beyond all manner of\r\ndoubt, if thou let it remain long in thy head, 'twill infect its\r\nneighbours; so 'tis my advice that thou out with it before the matter\r\ngrows worse.\" \"My judgment jumps with thine,\" quoth Nicostratus;\r\n\"wherefore send without delay for a chirurgeon to draw it.\" \"God forbid,\"\r\nreturned the lady, \"that chirurgeon come hither for such a purpose;\r\nmethinks, the case is such that I can very well dispense with him, and\r\ndraw the tooth myself. Besides which, these chirurgeons do these things\r\nin such a cruel way, that I could never endure to see thee or know thee\r\nunder the hands of any of them: wherefore my mind is quite made up to do\r\nit myself, that, at least, if thou shalt suffer too much, I may give it\r\nover at once, as a chirurgeon would not do.\" And so she caused the\r\ninstruments that are used on such occasions to be brought her, and having\r\ndismissed all other attendants save Lusca from the chamber, and locked\r\nthe door, made Nicostratus lie down on a table, set the pincers in his\r\nmouth, and clapped them on one of his teeth, which, while Lusca held him,\r\nso that, albeit he roared for pain, he might not move, she wrenched by\r\nmain force from his jaw, and keeping it close, took from Lusca's hand\r\nanother and horribly decayed tooth, which she shewed him, suffering and\r\nhalf dead as he was, saying:--\"See what thou hadst in thy jaw; mark how\r\nfar gone it is.\" Believing what she said, and deeming that, now the tooth\r\nwas out, his breath would no more be offensive, and being somewhat eased\r\nof the pain, which had been extreme, and still remained, so that he\r\nmurmured not little, by divers comforting applications, he quitted the\r\nchamber: whereupon the lady forthwith sent the tooth to her lover, who,\r\nhaving now full assurance of her love, placed himself entirely at her\r\nservice. But the lady being minded to make his assurance yet more sure,\r\nand deeming each hour a thousand till she might be with him, now saw fit,\r\nfor the more ready performance of the promise she had given him, to feign\r\nsickness; and Nicostratus, coming to see her one day after breakfast,\r\nattended only by Pyrrhus, she besought him for her better solacement, to\r\nhelp her down to the garden. Wherefore Nicostratus on one side, and\r\nPyrrhus on the other, took her and bore her down to the garden, and set\r\nher on a lawn at the foot of a beautiful pear-tree: and after they had\r\nsate there a while, the lady, who had already given Pyrrhus to understand\r\nwhat he must do, said to him:--\"Pyrrhus, I should greatly like to have\r\nsome of those pears; get thee up the tree, and shake some of them down.\"\r\nPyrrhus climbed the tree in a trice, and began to shake down the pears,\r\nand while he did so:--\"Fie! Sir,\" quoth he, \"what is this you do? And\r\nyou, Madam, have you no shame, that you suffer him to do so in my\r\npresence? Think you that I am blind? 'Twas but now that you were gravely\r\nindisposed. Your cure has been speedy indeed to permit of your so\r\nbehaving: and as for such a purpose you have so many goodly chambers, why\r\nbetake you not yourselves to one of them, if you must needs so disport\r\nyourselves? 'Twould be much more decent than to do so in my presence.\"\r\nWhereupon the lady, turning to her husband:--\"Now what can Pyrrhus mean?\"\r\nsaid she. \"Is he mad?\" \"Nay, Madam,\" quoth Pyrrhus; \"mad am not I. Think\r\nyou I see you not?\" Whereat Nicostratus marvelled not a little;\r\nand:--\"Pyrrhus,\" quoth he, \"I verily believe thou dreamest.\" \"Nay, my\r\nlord,\" replied Pyrrhus, \"not a whit do I dream; neither do you; rather\r\nyou wag it with such vigour, that, if this pear-tree did the like, there\r\nwould be never a pear left on it.\" Then the lady:--\"What can this mean?\"\r\nquoth she: \"can it be that it really seems to him to be as he says? Upon\r\nmy hope of salvation, were I but in my former health, I would get me up\r\nthere to judge for myself what these wonders are which he professes to\r\nsee.\" Whereupon, as Pyrrhus in the pear-tree continued talking in the\r\nsame strange strain:--\"Come down,\" quoth Nicostratus; and when he was\r\ndown:--\"Now what,\" said Nicostratus, \"is it thou sayst thou seest up\r\nthere?\" \"I suppose,\" replied Pyrrhus, \"that you take me to be deluded or\r\ndreaming: but as I must needs tell you the truth, I saw you lying upon\r\nyour wife, and then, when I came down, I saw you get up and sit you down\r\nhere where you now are.\" \"Therein,\" said Nicostratus, \"thou wast\r\ncertainly deluded, for, since thou clombest the pear-tree, we have not\r\nbudged a jot, save as thou seest.\" Then said Pyrrhus:--\"Why make more\r\nwords about the matter? See you I certainly did; and, seeing you, I saw\r\nyou lying upon your own.\" Nicostratus' wonder now waxed momently,\r\ninsomuch that he said:--\"I am minded to see if this pear-tree be\r\nenchanted, so that whoso is in it sees marvels;\" and so he got him up\r\ninto it. Whereupon the lady and Pyrrhus fell to disporting them, and\r\nNicostratus, seeing what they were about, exclaimed:--\"Ah! lewd woman,\r\nwhat is this thou doest? And thou, Pyrrhus, in whom I so much trusted!\"\r\nAnd so saying, he began to climb down. Meanwhile the lady and Pyrrhus had\r\nmade answer:--\"We are sitting here:\" and seeing him descending, they\r\nplaced themselves as they had been when he had left them, whom\r\nNicostratus, being come down, no sooner saw, than he fell a rating them.\r\nThen quoth Pyrrhus:--\"Verily, Nicostratus, I now acknowledge, that, as\r\nyou said a while ago, what I saw when I was in the pear-tree was but a\r\nfalse show, albeit I had never understood that so it was but that I now\r\nsee and know that thou hast also seen a false show. And that I speak\r\ntruth, you may sufficiently assure yourself, if you but reflect whether\r\n'tis likely that your wife, who for virtue and discretion has not her\r\npeer among women, would, if she were minded so to dishonour you, see fit\r\nto do so before your very eyes. Of myself I say nought, albeit I had\r\nliefer be hewn in pieces than that I should so much as think of such a\r\nthing, much less do it in your presence. Wherefore 'tis evident that 'tis\r\nsome illusion of sight that is propagated from the pear-tree; for nought\r\nin the world would have made me believe that I saw not you lying there in\r\ncarnal intercourse with your wife, had I not heard you say that you saw\r\nme doing that which most assuredly, so far from doing, I never so much as\r\nthought of.\" The lady then started up with a most resentful mien, and\r\nburst out with:--\"Foul fall thee, if thou knowest so little of me as to\r\nsuppose that, if I were minded to do thee such foul dishonour as thou\r\nsayst thou didst see me do, I would come hither to do it before thine\r\neyes! Rest assured that for such a purpose, were it ever mine, I should\r\ndeem one of our chambers more meet, and it should go hard but I would so\r\norder the matter that thou shouldst never know aught of it.\" Nicostratus,\r\nhaving heard both, and deeming that what they both averred must be true,\r\nto wit, that they would never have ventured upon such an act in his\r\npresence, passed from chiding to talk of the singularity of the thing,\r\nand how marvellous it was that the vision should reshape itself for every\r\none that clomb the tree. The lady, however, made a show of being\r\ndistressed that Nicostratus should so have thought of her,\r\nand:--\"Verily,\" quoth she, \"no woman, neither I nor another, shall again\r\nsuffer loss of honour by this pear-tree: run, Pyrrhus, and bring hither\r\nan axe, and at one and the same time vindicate thy honour and mine by\r\nfelling it, albeit 'twere better far Nicostratus' skull should feel the\r\nweight of the axe, seeing that in utter heedlessness he so readily\r\nsuffered the eyes of his mind to be blinded; for, albeit this vision was\r\nseen by the bodily eye, yet ought the understanding by no means to have\r\nentertained and affirmed it as real.\"\r\n\r\nSo Pyrrhus presently hied him to fetch the axe, and returning therewith\r\nfelled the pear; whereupon the lady, turning towards Nicostratus:--\"Now\r\nthat this foe of my honour is fallen,\" quoth she, \"my wrath is gone from\r\nme.\" Nicostratus then craving her pardon, she graciously granted it him,\r\nbidding him never again to suffer himself to be betrayed into thinking\r\nsuch a thing of her, who loved him more dearly than herself. So the poor\r\nduped husband went back with her and her lover to the palace, where not\r\nseldom in time to come Pyrrhus and Lydia took their pastime together more\r\nat ease. God grant us the like.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL X.\r\n\r\n--\r\nTwo Sienese love a lady, one of them being her gossip: the gossip dies,\r\nhaving promised his comrade to return to him from the other world; which\r\nhe does, and tells him what sort of life is led there.\r\n--\r\n\r\nNone now was left to tell, save the king, who, as soon as the ladies had\r\nceased mourning over the fall of the pear-tree, that had done no wrong,\r\nand were silent, began thus:--Most manifest it is that 'tis the prime\r\nduty of a just king to observe the laws that he has made; and, if he do\r\nnot so, he is to be esteemed no king, but a slave that has merited\r\npunishment, into which fault, and under which condemnation, I, your king,\r\nmust, as of necessity, fall. For, indeed, when yesterday I made the law\r\nwhich governs our discourse of to-day, I thought not to-day to avail\r\nmyself of my privilege, but to submit to the law, no less than you, and\r\nto discourse of the same topic whereof you all have discoursed; but not\r\nonly has the very story been told which I had intended to tell, but\r\ntherewithal so many things else, and so very much goodlier have been\r\nsaid, that, search my memory as I may, I cannot mind me of aught, nor wot\r\nI that touching such a matter there is indeed aught, for me to say, that\r\nwould be comparable with what has been said; wherefore, as infringe I\r\nmust the law that I myself have made, I confess myself worthy of\r\npunishment, and instantly declaring my readiness to pay any forfeit that\r\nmay be demanded of me, am minded to have recourse to my wonted privilege.\r\nAnd such, dearest ladies, is the potency of Elisa's story of the\r\ngodfather and his gossip, and therewith of the simplicity of the Sienese,\r\nthat I am prompted thereby to pass from this topic of the beguilement of\r\nfoolish husbands by their cunning wives to a little story touching these\r\nsame Sienese, which, albeit there is not a little therein which you were\r\nbest not to believe, may yet be in some degree entertaining to hear.\r\n\r\nKnow, then, that at Siena there dwelt in Porta Salaia two young men of\r\nthe people, named, the one, Tingoccio Mini, the other Meuccio di Tura,\r\nwho, by what appeared, loved one another not a little, for they were\r\nscarce ever out of one another's company; and being wont, like other\r\nfolk, to go to church and listen to sermons, they heard from time to time\r\nof the glory and the woe, which in the other world are allotted,\r\naccording to merit, to the souls of the dead. Of which matters craving,\r\nbut being unable to come by, more certain assurance, they agreed together\r\nthat, whichever of them should die first, should, if he might, return to\r\nthe survivor, and certify him of that which he would fain know; and this\r\nagreement they confirmed with an oath. Now, after they had made this\r\nengagement, and while they were still constantly together, Tingoccio\r\nchanced to become sponsor to one Ambruogio Anselmini, that dwelt in Campo\r\nReggi, who had had a son by his wife, Monna Mita. The lady was exceeding\r\nfair, and amorous withal, and Tingoccio being wont sometimes to visit her\r\nas his gossip, and to take Meuccio with him, he, notwithstanding his\r\nsponsorship, grew enamoured of her, as did also Meuccio, for she pleased\r\nhim not a little, and he heard her much commended by Tingoccio. Which\r\nlove each concealed from the other; but not for the same reason.\r\nTingoccio was averse to discover it to Meuccio, for that he deemed it an\r\nignominious thing to love his gossip, and was ashamed to let any one know\r\nit. Meuccio was on his guard for a very different reason, to wit, that he\r\nwas already ware that the lady was in Tingoccio's good graces. Wherefore\r\nhe said to himself:--If I avow my love to him, he will be jealous of me,\r\nand as, being her gossip, he can speak with her as often as he pleases,\r\nhe will do all he can to make her hate me, and so I shall never have any\r\nfavour of her.\r\n\r\nNow, the two young men being thus, as I have said, on terms of most\r\nfamiliar friendship, it befell that Tingoccio, being the better able to\r\nopen his heart to the lady, did so order his demeanour and discourse that\r\nhe had from her all that he desired. Nor was his friend's success hidden\r\nfrom Meuccio; though, much as it vexed him, yet still cherishing the hope\r\nof eventually attaining his end, and fearing to give Tingoccio occasion\r\nto baulk or hamper him in some way, he feigned to know nought of the\r\nmatter. So Tingoccio, more fortunate than his comrade, and rival in love,\r\ndid with such assiduity till his gossip's good land that he got thereby a\r\nmalady, which in the course of some days waxed so grievous that he\r\nsuccumbed thereto, and departed this life. And on the night of the third\r\nday after his decease (perchance because earlier he might not) he made\r\nhis appearance, according to his promise, in Meuccio's chamber, and\r\ncalled Meuccio, who was fast asleep, by his name. Whereupon:--\"Who art\r\nthou?\" quoth Meuccio, as he awoke. \"'Tis I, Tingoccio,\" replied he, \"come\r\nback, in fulfilment of the pledge I gave thee, to give thee tidings of\r\nthe other world.\" For a while Meuccio saw him not without terror: then,\r\nhis courage reviving:--\"Welcome, my brother,\" quoth he: and proceeded to\r\nask him if he were lost. \"Nought is lost but what is irrecoverable,\"\r\nreplied Tingoccio: \"how then should I be here, if I were lost?\" \"Nay,\"\r\nquoth then Meuccio; \"I mean it not so: I would know of thee, whether thou\r\nart of the number of the souls that are condemned to the penal fire of\r\nhell.\" \"Why no,\" returned Tingoccio, \"not just that; but still for the\r\nsins that I did I am in most sore and grievous torment.\" Meuccio then\r\nquestioned Tingoccio in detail of the pains there meted out for each of\r\nthe sins done here; and Tingoccio enumerated them all. Whereupon Meuccio\r\nasked if there were aught he might do for him here on earth. Tingoccio\r\nanswered in the affirmative; to wit, that he might have masses and\r\nprayers said and alms-deeds done for him, for that such things were of\r\ngreat service to the souls there. \"That gladly will I,\" replied Meuccio;\r\nand then, as Tingoccio was about to take his leave, he bethought him of\r\nthe gossip, and raising his head a little, he said:--\"I mind me,\r\nTingoccio, of the gossip, with whom thou wast wont to lie when thou wast\r\nhere. Now what is thy punishment for that?\" \"My brother,\" returned\r\nTingoccio, \"as soon as I got down there, I met one that seemed to know\r\nall my sins by heart, who bade me betake me to a place, where, while in\r\ndirest torment I bewept my sins, I found comrades not a few condemned to\r\nthe same pains; and so, standing there among them, and calling to mind\r\nwhat I had done with the gossip, and foreboding in requital thereof a\r\nmuch greater torment than had yet been allotted me, albeit I was in a\r\ngreat and most vehement flame, I quaked for fear in every part of me.\r\nWhich one that was beside me observing:--'What,' quoth he, 'hast thou\r\ndone more than the rest of us that are here, that thou quakest thus as\r\nthou standest in the fire?' 'My friend,' quoth I, 'I am in mortal fear of\r\nthe doom that I expect for a great sin that I once committed.' He then\r\nasked what sin it might be. ''Twas on this wise,' replied I: 'I lay with\r\nmy gossip, and that so much that I died thereof.' Whereat, he did but\r\nlaugh, saying:--'Go to, fool, make thy mind easy; for here there is no\r\naccount taken of gossips.' Which completely revived my drooping spirits.\"\r\n\r\n'Twas now near daybreak: wherefore:--\"Adieu! Meuccio,\" quoth his friend:\r\n\"for longer tarry with thee I may not;\" and so he vanished. As for\r\nMeuccio, having learned that no account was taken of gossips in the other\r\nworld, he began to laugh at his own folly in that he had already spared\r\ndivers such; and so, being quit of his ignorance, he in that respect in\r\ncourse of time waxed wise. Which matters had Fra Rinaldo but known, he\r\nwould not have needed to go about syllogizing in order to bring his fair\r\ngossip to pleasure him.\r\n\r\nThe sun was westering, and a light breeze blew, when the king, his story\r\nended, and none else being left to speak, arose, and taking off the\r\ncrown, set it on Lauretta's head, saying:--\"Madam, I crown you with\r\nyourself(1) queen of our company: 'tis now for you, as our sovereign\r\nlady, to make such ordinances as you shall deem meet for our common\r\nsolace and delectation;\" and having so said, he sat him down again. Queen\r\nLauretta sent for the seneschal, and bade him have a care that the tables\r\nshould be set in the pleasant vale somewhat earlier than had been their\r\nwont, that their return to the palace might be more leisurely; after\r\nwhich she gave him to know what else he had to do during her sovereignty.\r\nThen turning to the company:--\"Yesterday,\" quoth she, \"Dioneo would have\r\nit that to-day we should discourse of the tricks that wives play their\r\nhusbands; and but that I am minded not to shew as of the breed of yelping\r\ncurs, that are ever prompt to retaliate, I would ordain that to-morrow we\r\ndiscourse of the tricks that husbands play their wives. However, in lieu\r\nthereof, I will have every one take thought to tell of those tricks that,\r\ndaily, woman plays man, or man woman, or one man another; wherein, I\r\ndoubt not, there will be matter of discourse no less agreeable than has\r\nbeen that of to-day.\" So saying, she rose and dismissed the company until\r\nsupper-time. So the ladies and the men being risen, some bared their feet\r\nand betook them to the clear water, there to disport them, while others\r\ntook their pleasure upon the green lawn amid the trees that there grew\r\ngoodly and straight. For no brief while Dioneo and Fiammetta sang in\r\nconcert of Arcite and Palamon. And so, each and all taking their several\r\npastimes, they sped the hours with exceeding great delight until\r\nsupper-time. Which being come, they sat them down at table beside the\r\nlittle lake, and there, while a thousand songsters charmed their ears,\r\nand a gentle breeze, that blew from the environing hills, fanned them,\r\nand never a fly annoyed them, reposefully and joyously they supped. The\r\ntables removed, they roved a while about the pleasant vale, and then, the\r\nsun being still high, for 'twas but half vespers, the queen gave the\r\nword, and they wended their way back to their wonted abode, and going\r\nslowly, and beguiling the way with quips and quirks without number upon\r\ndivers matters, nor those alone of which they had that day discoursed,\r\nthey arrived, hard upon nightfall, at the goodly palace. There, the short\r\nwalk's fatigue dispelled by wines most cool and comfits, they presently\r\ngathered for the dance about the fair fountain, and now they footed it to\r\nthe strains of Tindaro's cornemuse, and now to other music. Which done,\r\nthe queen bade Filomena give them a song; and thus Filomena sang:--\r\n\r\nAh! woe is me, my soul!\r\n  Ah! shall I ever thither fare again\r\n  Whence I was parted to my grievous dole?\r\n\r\nFull sure I know not; but within my breast\r\n  Throbs ever the same fire\r\n  Of yearning there where erst I was to be.\r\n  O thou in whom is all my weal, my rest,\r\n  Lord of my heart's desire,\r\n  Ah! tell me thou! for none to ask save thee\r\n  Neither dare I, nor see.\r\n  Ah! dear my Lord, this wasted heart disdain\r\n  Thou wilt not, but with hope at length console.\r\n\r\nKindled the flame I know not what delight,\r\n  Which me doth so devour,\r\n  That day and night alike I find no ease;\r\n  For whether it was by hearing, touch, or sight,\r\n  Unwonted was the power,\r\n  And fresh the fire that me each way did seize;\r\n  Wherein without release\r\n  I languish still, and of thee, Lord, am fain,\r\n  For thou alone canst comfort and make whole.\r\n\r\nAh! tell me if it shall be, and how soon,\r\n  That I again thee meet\r\n  Where those death-dealing eyes I kissed. Thou, chief\r\n  Weal of my soul, my very soul, this boon\r\n  Deny not; say that fleet\r\n  Thou hiest hither: comfort thus my grief.\r\n  Ah! let the time be brief\r\n  Till thou art here, and then long time remain;\r\n  For I, Love-stricken, crave but Love's control.\r\n\r\nLet me but once again mine own thee call,\r\n  No more so indiscreet\r\n  As erst, I'll be, to let thee from me part:\r\n  Nay, I'll still hold thee, let what may befall,\r\n  And of thy mouth so sweet\r\n  Such solace take as may content my heart\r\n  So this be all my art,\r\n  Thee to entice, me with thine arms to enchain:\r\n  Whereon but musing inly chants my soul.\r\n\r\nThis song set all the company conjecturing what new and delightsome love\r\nmight now hold Filomena in its sway; and as its words imported that she\r\nhad had more joyance thereof than sight alone might yield, some that were\r\nthere grew envious of her excess of happiness. However, the song being\r\nended, the queen, bethinking her that the morrow was Friday, thus\r\ngraciously addressed them all:--\"Ye wot, noble ladies, and ye also, my\r\ngallants, that to-morrow is the day that is sacred to the passion of our\r\nLord, which, if ye remember, we kept devoutly when Neifile was queen,\r\nintermitting delectable discourse, as we did also on the ensuing\r\nSaturday. Wherefore, being minded to follow Neifile's excellent example,\r\nI deem that now, as then, 'twere a seemly thing to surcease from this our\r\npastime of story-telling for those two days, and compose our minds to\r\nmeditation on what was at that season accomplished for the weal of our\r\nsouls.\" All the company having approved their queen's devout speech, she,\r\nas the night was now far spent, dismissed them; and so they all betook\r\nthem to slumber.\r\n\r\n(1) A play upon laurea (laurel wreath) and Lauretta.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nEndeth here the seventh day of the Decameron, beginneth the eighth, in\r\nwhich, under the rule of Lauretta, discourse is had of those tricks that,\r\ndaily, woman plays man, or man woman, or one man another.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe summits of the loftiest mountains were already illumined by the rays\r\nof the rising sun, the shades of night were fled, and all things plainly\r\nvisible, when the queen and her company arose, and hied them first to the\r\ndewy mead, where for a while they walked: then, about half tierce, they\r\nwended their way to a little church that was hard by, where they heard\r\nDivine service; after which, they returned to the palace, and having\r\nbreakfasted with gay and gladsome cheer, and sung and danced a while,\r\nwere dismissed by the queen, to rest them as to each might seem good. But\r\nwhen the sun was past the meridian, the queen mustered them again for\r\ntheir wonted pastime; and, all being seated by the fair fountain, thus,\r\nat her command, Neifile began.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL I.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGulfardo borrows moneys of Guasparruolo, which he has agreed to give\r\nGuasparruolo's wife, that he may lie with her. He gives them to her, and\r\nin her presence tells Guasparruolo that he has done so, and she\r\nacknowledges that 'tis true.\r\n--\r\n\r\nSith God has ordained that 'tis for me to take the lead to-day with my\r\nstory, well pleased am I. And for that, loving ladies, much has been said\r\ntouching the tricks that women play men, I am minded to tell you of one\r\nthat a man played a woman, not because I would censure what the man did,\r\nor say that 'twas not merited by the woman, but rather to commend the man\r\nand censure the woman, and to shew that men may beguile those that think\r\nto beguile them, as well as be beguiled by those they think to beguile;\r\nfor peradventure what I am about to relate should in strictness of speech\r\nnot be termed beguilement, but rather retaliation; for, as it behoves\r\nwoman to be most strictly virtuous, and to guard her chastity as her very\r\nlife, nor on any account to allow herself to sully it, which\r\nnotwithstanding, 'tis not possible by reason of our frailty that there\r\nshould be as perfect an observance of this law as were meet, I affirm,\r\nthat she that allows herself to infringe it for money merits the fire;\r\nwhereas she that so offends under the prepotent stress of Love will\r\nreceive pardon from any judge that knows how to temper justice with\r\nmercy: witness what but the other day we heard from Filostrato touching\r\nMadonna Filippa at Prato.(1)\r\n\r\nKnow, then, that there was once at Milan a German mercenary, Gulfardo by\r\nname, a doughty man, and very loyal to those with whom he took service; a\r\nquality most uncommon in Germans. And as he was wont to be most faithful\r\nin repaying whatever moneys he borrowed, he would have had no difficulty\r\nin finding a merchant to advance him any amount of money at a low rate of\r\ninterest. Now, tarrying thus at Milan, Gulfardo fixed his affection on a\r\nvery fine woman, named Madonna Ambruogia, the wife of a wealthy merchant,\r\none Guasparruolo Cagastraccio, with whom he was well acquainted and on\r\nfriendly terms: which amour he managed with such discretion that neither\r\nthe husband nor any one else wist aught of it. So one day he sent her a\r\nmessage, beseeching her of her courtesy to gratify his passion, and\r\nassuring her that he on his part was ready to obey her every behest.\r\n\r\nThe lady made a great many words about the affair, the upshot of which\r\nwas that she would do as Gulfardo desired upon the following terms: to\r\nwit, that, in the first place, he should never discover the matter to a\r\nsoul, and, secondly, that, as for some purpose or another she required\r\ntwo hundred florins of gold, he out of his abundance should supply her\r\nnecessity; these conditions being satisfied she would be ever at his\r\nservice. Offended by such base sordidness in one whom he had supposed to\r\nbe an honourable woman, Gulfardo passed from ardent love to something\r\nvery like hatred, and cast about how he might flout her. So he sent her\r\nword that he would right gladly pleasure her in this and in any other\r\nmatter that might be in his power; let her but say when he was to come to\r\nsee her, and he would bring the moneys with him, and none should know of\r\nthe matter except a comrade of his, in whom he placed much trust, and who\r\nwas privy to all that he did. The lady, if she should not rather be\r\ncalled the punk, gleefully made answer that in the course of a few days\r\nher husband, Guasparruolo, was to go to Genoa on business, and that, when\r\nhe was gone, she would let Gulfardo know, and appoint a time for him to\r\nvisit her. Gulfardo thereupon chose a convenient time, and hied him to\r\nGuasparruolo, to whom:--\"I am come,\" quoth he, \"about a little matter of\r\nbusiness which I have on hand, for which I require two hundred florins of\r\ngold, and I should be glad if thou wouldst lend them me at the rate of\r\ninterest which thou art wont to charge me.\" \"That gladly will I,\" replied\r\nGuasparruolo, and told out the money at once. A few days later\r\nGuasparruolo being gone to Genoa, as the lady had said, she sent word to\r\nGulfardo that he should bring her the two hundred florins of gold. So\r\nGulfardo hied him with his comrade to the lady's house, where he found\r\nher expecting him, and lost no time in handing her the two hundred\r\nflorins of gold in his comrade's presence, saying:--\"You will keep the\r\nmoney, Madam, and give it to your husband when he returns.\" Witting not\r\nwhy Gulfardo so said, but thinking that 'twas but to conceal from his\r\ncomrade that it was given by way of price, the lady made answer:--\"That\r\nwill I gladly; but I must first see whether the amount is right;\"\r\nwhereupon she told the florins out upon a table, and when she found that\r\nthe two hundred were there, she put them away in high glee, and turning\r\nto Gulfardo, took him into her chamber, where, not on that night only but\r\non many another night, while her husband was away, he had of her all that\r\nhe craved. On Guasparruolo's return Gulfardo presently paid him a visit,\r\nhaving first made sure that the lady would be with him, and so in her\r\npresence:--\"Guasparruolo,\" quoth he, \"I had after all no occasion for the\r\nmoney, to wit, the two hundred florins of gold that thou didst lend me\r\nthe other day, being unable to carry through the transaction for which I\r\nborrowed them, and so I took an early opportunity of bringing them to thy\r\nwife, and gave them to her: thou wilt therefore cancel the account.\"\r\nWhereupon Guasparruolo turned to the lady, and asked her if she had had\r\nthem. She, not daring to deny the fact in presence of the witness,\r\nanswered:--\"Why, yes, I had them, and quite forgot to tell thee.\" \"Good,\"\r\nquoth then Guasparruolo, \"we are quits, Gulfardo; make thy mind easy; I\r\nwill see that thy account is set right.\" Gulfardo then withdrew, leaving\r\nthe flouted lady to hand over her ill-gotten gains to her husband; and so\r\nthe astute lover had his pleasure of his greedy mistress for nothing.\r\n\r\n(1) Cf. Sixth Day, Novel VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL II.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThe priest of Varlungo lies with Monna Belcolore: he leaves with her his\r\ncloak by way of pledge, and receives from her a mortar. He returns the\r\nmortar, and demands of her the cloak that he had left in pledge, which\r\nthe good lady returns him with a gibe.\r\n--\r\n\r\nLadies and men alike commended Gulfardo for the check that he gave to the\r\ngreed of the Milanese lady; but before they had done, the queen turned to\r\nPamfilo, and with a smile bade him follow suit: wherefore thus Pamfilo\r\nbegan:--Fair my ladies, it occurs to me to tell you a short story, which\r\nreflects no credit on those by whom we are continually wronged without\r\nbeing able to retaliate, to wit, the priests, who have instituted a\r\ncrusade against our wives, and deem that, when they have made conquest of\r\none of them, they have done a work every whit as worthy of recompense by\r\nremission of sin and punishment as if they had brought the Soldan in\r\nchains to Avignon: in which respect 'tis not possible for the hapless\r\nlaity to be even with them: howbeit they are as hot to make reprisals on\r\nthe priests' mothers, sisters, mistresses, and daughters as the priests\r\nto attack their wives. Wherefore I am minded to give you, as I may do in\r\nfew words, the history of a rustic amour, the conclusion whereof was not\r\na little laughable, nor barren of moral, for you may also gather\r\ntherefrom, that 'tis not always well to believe everything that a priest\r\nsays.\r\n\r\nI say then, that at Varlungo, a village hard by here, as all of you, my\r\nladies, should wot either of your own knowledge or by report, there dwelt\r\na worthy priest, and doughty of body in the service of the ladies: who,\r\nalbeit he was none too quick at his book, had no lack of precious and\r\nblessed solecisms to edify his flock withal of a Sunday under the elm.\r\nAnd when the men were out of doors, he would visit their wives as never a\r\npriest had done before him, bringing them feast-day gowns and holy water,\r\nand now and again a bit of candle, and giving them his blessing. Now it\r\nso befell that among those of his fair parishioners whom he most affected\r\nthe first place was at length taken by one Monna Belcolore, the wife of a\r\nhusbandman that called himself Bentivegna del Mazzo. And in good sooth\r\nshe was a winsome and lusty country lass, brown as a berry and buxom\r\nenough, and fitter than e'er another for his mill. Moreover she had not\r\nher match in playing the tabret and singing:--The borage is full\r\nsappy,(1) and in leading a brawl or a breakdown, no matter who might be\r\nnext her, with a fair and dainty kerchief in her hand. Which spells so\r\nwrought upon Master Priest, that for love of her he grew distracted, and\r\ndid nought all day long but loiter about the village on the chance of\r\ncatching sight of her. And if of a Sunday morning he espied her in\r\nchurch, he strove might and main to acquit himself of his Kyrie and\r\nSanctus in the style of a great singer, albeit his performance was liker\r\nto the braying of an ass: whereas, if he saw her not, he scarce exerted\r\nhimself at all. However, he managed with such discretion that neither\r\nBentivegna del Mazzo nor any of the neighbours wist aught of his love.\r\nAnd hoping thereby to ingratiate himself with Monna Belcolore, he from\r\ntime to time would send her presents, now a clove of fresh garlic, the\r\nbest in all the country-side, from his own garden, which he tilled with\r\nhis own hands, and anon a basket of beans or a bunch of chives or\r\nshallots; and, when he thought it might serve his turn, he would give her\r\na sly glance, and follow it up with a little amorous mocking and mowing,\r\nwhich she, with rustic awkwardness, feigned not to understand, and ever\r\nmaintained her reserve, so that Master Priest made no headway.\r\n\r\nNow it so befell that one day, when the priest at high noon was aimlessly\r\ngadding about the village, he encountered Bentivegna del Mazzo at the\r\ntail of a well laden ass; and greeted him, asking him whither he was\r\ngoing. \"I'faith, Sir,\" quoth Bentivegna, \"for sure 'tis to town I go,\r\nhaving an affair or two to attend to there; and I am taking these things\r\nto Ser Buonaccorri da Ginestreto, to get him to stand by me in I wot not\r\nwhat matter, whereof the justice o' th' coram has by his provoker served\r\nme with a pertrumpery summons to appear before him.\" Whereupon:--\"'Tis\r\nwell, my son,\" quoth the priest, overjoyed, \"my blessing go with thee:\r\ngood luck to thee and a speedy return; and harkye, shouldst thou see\r\nLapuccio or Naldino, do not forget to tell them to send me those thongs\r\nfor my flails.\" \"It shall be done,\" quoth Bentivegna, and jogged on\r\ntowards Florence, while the priest, thinking that now was his time to hie\r\nhim to Belcolore and try his fortune, put his best leg forward, and\r\nstayed not till he was at the house, which entering, he said:--\"God be\r\ngracious to us! Who is within?\" Belcolore, who was up in the loft, made\r\nanswer:--\"Welcome, Sir; but what dost thou, gadding about in the heat?\"\r\n\"Why, as I hope for God's blessing,\" quoth he, \"I am just come to stay\r\nwith thee a while, having met thy husband on his way to town.\" Whereupon\r\ndown came Belcolore, took a seat, and began sifting cabbage-seed that her\r\nhusband had lately threshed. By and by the priest began:--\"So, Belcolore,\r\nwilt thou keep me ever a dying thus?\" Whereat Belcolore tittered, and\r\nsaid:--\"Why, what is't I do to you?\" \"Truly, nothing at all,\" replied the\r\npriest: \"but thou sufferest me not to do to thee that which I had lief,\r\nand which God commands.\" \"Now away with you!\" returned Belcolore, \"do\r\npriests do that sort of thing?\" \"Indeed we do,\" quoth the priest, \"and to\r\nbetter purpose than others: why not? I tell you our grinding is far\r\nbetter; and wouldst thou know why? 'tis because 'tis intermittent. And in\r\ntruth 'twill be well worth thy while to keep thine own counsel, and let\r\nme do it.\" \"Worth my while!\" ejaculated Belcolore. \"How may that be?\r\nThere is never a one of you but would overreach the very Devil.\" \"'Tis\r\nnot for me to say,\" returned the priest; \"say but what thou wouldst have:\r\nshall it be a pair of dainty shoes? Or wouldst thou prefer a fillet? Or\r\nperchance a gay riband? What's thy will?\" \"Marry, no lack have I,\" quoth\r\nBelcolore, \"of such things as these. But, if you wish me so well, why do\r\nme not a service? and I would then be at your command.\" \"Name but the\r\nservice,\" returned the priest, \"and gladly will I do it.\" Quoth then\r\nBelcolore:--\"On Saturday I have to go to Florence to deliver some wool\r\nthat I have spun, and to get my spinning-wheel put in order: lend me but\r\nfive pounds--I know you have them--and I will redeem my perse petticoat\r\nfrom the pawnshop, and also the girdle that I wear on saints' days, and\r\nthat I had when I was married--you see that without them I cannot go to\r\nchurch or anywhere else, and then I will do just as you wish thenceforth\r\nand forever.\" Whereupon:--\"So God give me a good year,\" quoth he, \"as I\r\nhave not the money with me: but never fear that I will see that thou hast\r\nit before Saturday with all the pleasure in life.\" \"Ay, ay,\" rejoined\r\nBelcolore, \"you all make great promises, but then you never keep them.\r\nThink you to serve me as you served Biliuzza, whom you left in the lurch\r\nat last? God's faith, you do not so. To think that she turned woman of\r\nthe world just for that! If you have not the money with you, why, go and\r\nget it.\" \"Prithee,\" returned the priest, \"send me not home just now. For,\r\nseest thou, 'tis the very nick of time with me, and the coast is clear,\r\nand perchance it might not be so on my return, and in short I know not\r\nwhen it would be likely to go so well as now.\" Whereto she did but\r\nrejoin:--\"Good; if you are minded to go, get you gone; if not, stay where\r\nyou are.\" The priest, therefore, seeing that she was not disposed to give\r\nhim what he wanted, as he was fain, to wit, on his own terms, but was\r\nbent upon having a quid pro quo, changed his tone; and:--\"Lo, now,\" quoth\r\nhe, \"thou doubtest I will not bring thee the money; so to set thy mind at\r\nrest, I will leave thee this cloak--thou seest 'tis good sky-blue\r\nsilk--in pledge.\" So raising her head and glancing at the cloak:--\"And\r\nwhat may the cloak be worth?\" quoth Belcolore. \"Worth!\" ejaculated the\r\npriest: \"I would have thee know that 'tis all Douai, not to say Trouai,\r\nmake: nay, there are some of our folk here that say 'tis Quadrouai; and\r\n'tis not a fortnight since I bought it of Lotto, the secondhand dealer,\r\nfor seven good pounds, and then had it five good soldi under value, by\r\nwhat I hear from Buglietto, who, thou knowest, is an excellent judge of\r\nthese articles.\" \"Oh! say you so?\" exclaimed Belcolore. \"So help me God,\r\nI should not have thought it; however, let me look at it.\" So Master\r\nPriest, being ready for action, doffed the cloak and handed it to her.\r\nAnd she, having put it in a safe place, said to him:--\"Now, Sir, we will\r\naway to the hut; there is never a soul goes there;\" and so they did. And\r\nthere Master Priest, giving her many a mighty buss and straining her to\r\nhis sacred person, solaced himself with her no little while.\r\n\r\nWhich done, he hied him away in his cassock, as if he were come from\r\nofficiating at a wedding; but, when he was back in his holy quarters, he\r\nbethought him that not all the candles that he received by way of\r\noffering in the course of an entire year would amount to the half of five\r\npounds, and saw that he had made a bad bargain, and repented him that he\r\nhad left the cloak in pledge, and cast about how he might recover it\r\nwithout paying anything. And as he did not lack cunning, he hit upon an\r\nexcellent expedient, by which he compassed his end. So on the morrow,\r\nbeing a saint's day, he sent a neighbour's lad to Monna Belcolore with a\r\nrequest that she would be so good as to lend him her stone mortar, for\r\nthat Binguccio dal Poggio and Nuto Buglietti were to breakfast with him\r\nthat morning, and he therefore wished to make a sauce. Belcolore having\r\nsent the mortar, the priest, about breakfast time, reckoning that\r\nBentivegna del Mazzo and Belcolore would be at their meal, called his\r\nclerk, and said to him:--\"Take the mortar back to Belcolore, and\r\nsay:--'My master thanks you very kindly, and bids you return the cloak\r\nthat the lad left with you in pledge.'\" The clerk took the mortar to\r\nBelcolore's house, where, finding her at table with Bentivegna, he set\r\nthe mortar down and delivered the priest's message. Whereto Belcolore\r\nwould fain have demurred; but Bentivegna gave her a threatening glance,\r\nsaying:--\"So, then, thou takest a pledge from Master Priest? By Christ, I\r\nvow, I have half a mind to give thee a great clout o' the chin. Go, give\r\nit back at once, a murrain on thee! And look to it that whatever he may\r\nhave a mind to, were it our very ass, he be never denied.\" So, with a\r\nvery bad grace, Belcolore got up, and went to the wardrobe, and took out\r\nthe cloak, and gave it to the clerk, saying:--\"Tell thy master from\r\nme:--Would to God he may never ply pestle in my mortar again, such honour\r\nhas he done me for this turn!\" So the clerk returned with the cloak, and\r\ndelivered the message to Master Priest; who, laughing, made\r\nanswer:--\"Tell her, when thou next seest her, that, so she lend us not\r\nthe mortar, I will not lend her the pestle: be it tit for tat.\"\r\n\r\nBentivegna made no account of his wife's words, deeming that 'twas but\r\nhis chiding that had provoked them. But Belcolore was not a little\r\ndispleased with Master Priest, and had never a word to say to him till\r\nthe vintage; after which, what with the salutary fear in which she stood\r\nof the mouth of Lucifer the Great, to which he threatened to consign her,\r\nand the must and roast chestnuts that he sent her, she made it up with\r\nhim, and many a jolly time they had together. And though she got not the\r\nfive pounds from him, he put a new skin on her tabret, and fitted it with\r\na little bell, wherewith she was satisfied.\r\n\r\n(1) For this folk-song see Cantilene e Ballate, Strambotti e Madrigali,\r\ned.

Thinking to have found it, Calandrino gets him home laden\r\nwith stones. His wife chides him: whereat he waxes wroth, beats her, and\r\ntells his comrades what they know better than he.\r\n--\r\n\r\nEnded Pamfilo's story, which moved the ladies to inextinguishable\r\nlaughter, the queen bade Elisa follow suit: whereupon, laughing, she thus\r\nbegan:--I know not, debonair my ladies, whether with my little story,\r\nwhich is no less true than entertaining, I shall give you occasion to\r\nlaugh as much as Pamfilo has done with his, but I will do my best.\r\n\r\nIn our city, where there has never been lack of odd humours and queer\r\nfolk, there dwelt, no long time ago, a painter named Calandrino, a simple\r\nsoul, of uncouth manners, that spent most of his time with two other\r\npainters, the one Bruno, the other Buffalmacco, by name, pleasant fellows\r\nenough, but not without their full share of sound and shrewd sense, and\r\nwho kept with Calandrino for that they not seldom found his singular ways\r\nand his simplicity very diverting. There was also at the same time at\r\nFlorence one Maso del Saggio, a fellow marvellously entertaining by his\r\ncleverness, dexterity and unfailing resource; who having heard somewhat\r\ntouching Calandrino's simplicity, resolved to make fun of him by playing\r\nhim a trick, and inducing him to believe some prodigy. And happening one\r\nday to come upon Calandrino in the church of San Giovanni, where he sate\r\nintently regarding the paintings and intaglios of the tabernacle above\r\nthe altar, which had then but lately been set there, he deemed time and\r\nplace convenient for the execution of his design; which he accordingly\r\nimparted to one of his comrades: whereupon the two men drew nigh the\r\nplace where Calandrino sate alone, and feigning not to see him fell a\r\ntalking of the virtues of divers stones, of which Maso spoke as aptly and\r\npertinently as if he had been a great and learned lapidary. Calandrino\r\nheard what passed between them, and witting that 'twas no secret, after a\r\nwhile got up, and joined them, to Maso's no small delight. He therefore\r\ncontinued his discourse, and being asked by Calandrino, where these\r\nstones of such rare virtues were to be found, made answer:--\"Chiefly in\r\nBerlinzone, in the land of the Basques. The district is called Bengodi,\r\nand there they bind the vines with sausages, and a denier will buy a\r\ngoose and a gosling into the bargain; and on a mountain, all of grated\r\nParmesan cheese, dwell folk that do nought else but make macaroni and\r\nraviuoli,(1) and boil them in capon's broth, and then throw them down to\r\nbe scrambled for; and hard by flows a rivulet of Vernaccia, the best that\r\never was drunk, and never a drop of water therein.\" \"Ah! 'tis a sweet\r\ncountry!\" quoth Calandrino; \"but tell me, what becomes of the capons that\r\nthey boil?\" \"They are all eaten by the Basques,\" replied Maso.\r\nThen:--\"Wast thou ever there?\" quoth Calandrino. Whereupon:--\"Was I ever\r\nthere, sayst thou?\" replied Maso. \"Why, if I have been there once, I have\r\nbeen there a thousand times.\" \"And how many miles is't from here?\" quoth\r\nCalandrino. \"Oh!\" returned Maso, \"more than thou couldst number in a\r\nnight without slumber.\" \"Farther off, then, than the Abruzzi?\" said\r\nCalandrino. \"Why, yes, 'tis a bit farther,\" replied Maso.\r\n\r\nNow Calandrino, like the simple soul that he was, marking the composed\r\nand grave countenance with which Maso spoke, could not have believed him\r\nmore thoroughly, if he had uttered the most patent truth, and thus taking\r\nhis words for gospel:--\"'Tis a trifle too far for my purse,\" quoth he;\r\n\"were it nigher, I warrant thee, I would go with thee thither one while,\r\njust to see the macaroni come tumbling down, and take my fill thereof.\r\nBut tell me, so good luck befall thee, are none of these stones, that\r\nhave these rare virtues, to be found in these regions?\" \"Ay,\" replied\r\nMaso, \"two sorts of stone are found there, both of virtues extraordinary.\r\nThe one sort are the sandstones of Settignano and Montisci, which being\r\nmade into millstones, by virtue thereof flour is made; wherefore 'tis a\r\ncommon saying in those countries that blessings come from God and\r\nmillstones from Montisci: but, for that these sandstones are in great\r\nplenty, they are held cheap by us, just as by them are emeralds, whereof\r\nthey have mountains, bigger than Monte Morello, that shine at midnight, a\r\nGod's name! And know this, that whoso should make a goodly pair of\r\nmillstones, and connect them with a ring before ever a hole was drilled\r\nin them, and take them to the Soldan, should get all he would have\r\nthereby. The other sort of stone is the heliotrope, as we lapidaries call\r\nit, a stone of very great virtue, inasmuch as whoso carries it on his\r\nperson is seen, so long as he keep it, by never another soul, where he is\r\nnot.\" \"These be virtues great indeed,\" quoth Calandrino; \"but where is\r\nthis second stone to be found?\" Whereto Maso made answer that there were\r\nusually some to be found in the Mugnone. \"And what are its size and\r\ncolour?\" quoth Calandrino. \"The size varies,\" replied Maso, \"for some are\r\nbigger and some smaller than others; but all are of the same colour,\r\nbeing nearly black.\" All these matters duly marked and fixed in his\r\nmemory, Calandrino made as if he had other things to attend to, and took\r\nhis leave of Maso with the intention of going in quest of the stone, but\r\nnot until he had let his especial friends, Bruno and Buffalmacco, know of\r\nhis project. So, that no time might be lost, but, postponing everything\r\nelse, they might begin the quest at once, he set about looking for them,\r\nand spent the whole morning in the search. At length, when 'twas already\r\npast none, he called to mind that they would be at work in the Faentine\r\nwomen's convent, and though 'twas excessively hot, he let nothing stand\r\nin his way, but at a pace that was more like a run than a walk, hied him\r\nthither; and so soon as he had made them ware of his presence, thus he\r\nspoke:--\"Comrades, so you are but minded to hearken to me, 'tis in our\r\npower to become the richest men in Florence; for I am informed by one\r\nthat may be trusted that there is a kind of stone in the Mugnone which\r\nrenders whoso carries it invisible to every other soul in the world.\r\nWherefore, methinks, we were wise to let none have the start of us, but\r\ngo search for this stone without any delay. We shall find it without a\r\ndoubt, for I know what 'tis like, and when we have found it, we have but\r\nto put it in the purse, and get us to the moneychangers, whose counters,\r\nas you know, are always laden with groats and florins, and help ourselves\r\nto as many as we have a mind to. No one will see us, and so, hey presto!\r\nwe shall be rich folk in the twinkling of an eye, and have no more need\r\nto go besmearing the walls all day long like so many snails.\" Whereat\r\nBruno and Buffalmacco began only to laugh, and exchanging glances, made\r\nas if they marvelled exceedingly, and expressed approval of Calandrino's\r\nproject. Then Buffalmacco asked, what might be the name of the stone.\r\nCalandrino, like the numskull that he was, had already forgotten the\r\nname: so he made answer:--\"Why need we concern ourselves with the name,\r\nsince we know the stone's virtue? methinks, we were best to go look for\r\nit, and waste no more time.\" \"Well, well,\" said Bruno, \"but what are the\r\nsize and shape of the stone?\" \"They are of all sizes and shapes,\" said\r\nCalandrino, \"but they are all pretty nearly black; wherefore, methinks,\r\nwe were best to collect all the black stones that we see until we hit\r\nupon it: and so, let us be off, and lose no more time.\" \"Nay, but,\" said\r\nBruno, \"wait a bit.\" And turning to Buffalmacco:--\"Methinks,\" quoth he,\r\n\"that Calandrino says well: but I doubt this is not the time for such\r\nwork, seeing that the sun is high, and his rays so flood the Mugnone as\r\nto dry all the stones; insomuch that stones will now shew as white that\r\nin the morning, before the sun had dried them, would shew as black:\r\nbesides which, to-day being a working-day, there will be for one cause or\r\nanother folk not a few about the Mugnone, who, seeing us, might guess\r\nwhat we were come for, and peradventure do the like themselves; whereby\r\nit might well be that they found the stone, and we might miss the trot by\r\ntrying after the amble. Wherefore, so you agree, methinks we were best to\r\ngo about it in the morning, when we shall be better able to distinguish\r\nthe black stones from the white, and on a holiday, when there will be\r\nnone to see us.\"\r\n\r\nBuffalmacco's advice being approved by Bruno, Calandrino chimed in; and\r\nso 'twas arranged that they should all three go in quest of the stone on\r\nthe following Sunday. So Calandrino, having besought his companions above\r\nall things to let never a soul in the world hear aught of the matter, for\r\nthat it had been imparted to him in strict confidence, and having told\r\nthem what he had heard touching the land of Bengodi, the truth of which\r\nhe affirmed with oaths, took leave of them; and they concerted their\r\nplan, while Calandrino impatiently expected the Sunday morning. Whereon,\r\nabout dawn, he arose, and called them; and forth they issued by the Porta\r\na San Gallo, and hied them to the Mugnone, and following its course,\r\nbegan their quest of the stone, Calandrino, as was natural, leading the\r\nway, and jumping lightly from rock to rock, and wherever he espied a\r\nblack stone, stooping down, picking it up and putting it in the fold of\r\nhis tunic, while his comrades followed, picking up a stone here and a\r\nstone there. Thus it was that Calandrino had not gone far, before,\r\nfinding that there was no more room in his tunic, he lifted the skirts of\r\nhis gown, which was not cut after the fashion of Hainault, and gathering\r\nthem under his leathern girdle and making them fast on every side, thus\r\nfurnished himself with a fresh and capacious lap, which, however, taking\r\nno long time to fill, he made another lap out of his cloak, which in like\r\nmanner he soon filled with stones. Wherefore, Bruno and Buffalmacco\r\nseeing that Calandrino was well laden, and that 'twas nigh upon\r\nbreakfast-time, and the moment for action come:--\"Where is Calandrino?\"\r\nquoth Bruno to Buffalmacco. Whereto Buffalmacco, who had Calandrino full\r\nin view, having first turned about and looked here, there and everywhere,\r\nmade answer:--\"That wot not I; but not so long ago he was just in front\r\nof us.\" \"Not so long ago, forsooth,\" returned Bruno; \"'tis my firm belief\r\nthat at this very moment he is at breakfast at home, having left to us\r\nthis wild-goose chase of black stones in the Mugnone.\" \"Marry,\" quoth\r\nBuffalmacco, \"he did but serve us right so to trick us and leave, seeing\r\nthat we were so silly as to believe him. Why, who could have thought that\r\nany but we would have been so foolish as to believe that a stone of such\r\nrare virtue was to be found in the Mugnone?\" Calandrino, hearing their\r\ncolloquy, forthwith imagined that he had the stone in his hand, and by\r\nits virtue, though present, was invisible to them; and overjoyed by such\r\ngood fortune, would not say a word to undeceive them, but determined to\r\nhie him home, and accordingly faced about, and put himself in motion.\r\nWhereupon:--\"Ay!\" quoth Buffalmacco to Bruno, \"what are we about that we\r\ngo not back too?\" \"Go we then,\" said Bruno; \"but by God I swear that\r\nCalandrino shall never play me another such trick; and as to this, were I\r\nnigh him, as I have been all the morning, I would teach him to remember\r\nit for a month or so, such a reminder would I give him in the heel with\r\nthis stone.\" And even as he spoke he threw back his arm, and launched the\r\nstone against Calandrino's heel. Galled by the blow, Calandrino gave a\r\ngreat hop and a slight gasp, but said nothing, and halted not. Then,\r\npicking out one of the stones that he had collected:--\"Bruno,\" quoth\r\nBuffalmacco, \"see what a goodly stone I have here, would it might but\r\ncatch Calandrino in the back;\" and forthwith he discharged it with main\r\nforce upon the said back. And in short, suiting action to word, now in\r\nthis way, now in that, they stoned him all the way up the Mugnone as far\r\nas the Porta a San Gallo. There they threw away the stones they had\r\npicked up, and tarried a while with the customs' officers, who, being\r\nprimed by them, had let Calandrino pass unchallenged, while their\r\nlaughter knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nSo Calandrino, halting nowhere, betook him to his house, which was hard\r\nby the corner of the Macina. And so well did Fortune prosper the trick,\r\nthat all the way by the stream and across the city there was never a soul\r\nthat said a word to Calandrino, and indeed he encountered but few, for\r\nmost folk were at breakfast. But no sooner was Calandrino thus gotten\r\nhome with his stones, than it so happened that his good lady, Monna\r\nTessa, shewed her fair face at the stair's head, and catching sight of\r\nhim, and being somewhat annoyed by his long delay, chid him,\r\nsaying:--\"What the Devil brings thee here so late? Must breakfast wait\r\nthee until all other folk have had it?\" Calandrino caught the words, and\r\nangered and mortified to find that he was not invisible, broke out\r\nwith:--\"Alas! curst woman! so 'twas thou! Thou hast undone me: but, God's\r\nfaith, I will pay thee out.\" Whereupon he was upstairs in a trice, and\r\nhaving discharged his great load of stones in a parlour, rushed with fell\r\nintent upon his wife, and laid hold of her by the hair, and threw her\r\ndown at his feet, and beat and kicked her in every part of her person\r\nwith all the force he had in his arms and legs, insomuch that he left\r\nnever a hair of her head or bone of her body unscathed, and 'twas all in\r\nvain that she laid her palms together and crossed her fingers and cried\r\nfor mercy.\r\n\r\nNow Buffalmacco and Bruno, after making merry a while with the warders of\r\nthe gate, had set off again at a leisurely pace, keeping some distance\r\nbehind Calandrino. Arrived at his door, they heard the noise of the sound\r\nthrashing that he was giving his wife; and making as if they were but\r\nthat very instant come upon the scene, they called him. Calandrino,\r\nflushed, all of a sweat, and out of breath, shewed himself at the window,\r\nand bade them come up. They, putting on a somewhat angry air, did so; and\r\nespied Calandrino sitting in the parlour, amid the stones which lay all\r\nabout, untrussed, and puffing with the air of a man spent with exertion,\r\nwhile his lady lay in one of the corners, weeping bitterly, her hair all\r\ndishevelled, her clothes torn to shreds, and her face livid, bruised and\r\nbattered. So after surveying the room a while:--\"What means this,\r\nCalandrino?\" quoth they. \"Art thou minded to build thee a wall, that we\r\nsee so many stones about?\" And then, as they received no answer, they\r\ncontinued:--\"And how's this? How comes Monna Tessa in this plight?\r\n'Twould seem thou hast given her a beating! What unheard-of doings are\r\nthese?\" What with the weight of the stones that he had carried, and the\r\nfury with which he had beaten his wife, and the mortification that he\r\nfelt at the miscarriage of his enterprise, Calandrino was too spent to\r\nutter a word by way of reply. Wherefore in a menacing tone Buffalmacco\r\nbegan again:--\"However out of sorts thou mayst have been, Calandrino,\r\nthou shouldst not have played us so scurvy a trick as thou hast. To take\r\nus with thee to the Mugnone in quest of this stone of rare virtue, and\r\nthen, without so much as saying either God-speed or Devil-speed, to be\r\noff, and leave us there like a couple of gowks! We take it not a little\r\nunkindly: and rest assured that thou shalt never so fool us again.\"\r\nWhereto with an effort Calandrino replied:--\"Comrades, be not wroth with\r\nme: 'tis not as you think. I, luckless wight! found the stone: listen,\r\nand you will no longer doubt that I say sooth. When you began saying one\r\nto the other:--'Where is Calandrino?' I was within ten paces of you, and\r\nmarking that you came by without seeing me, I went before, and so,\r\nkeeping ever a little ahead of you, I came hither.\" And then he told them\r\nthe whole story of what they had said and done from beginning to end, and\r\nshewed them his back and heel, how they had been mauled by the stones;\r\nafter which:--\"And I tell you,\" he went on, \"that, laden though I was\r\nwith all these stones, that you see here, never a word was said to me by\r\nthe warders of the gate as I passed in, though you know how vexatious and\r\ngrievous these warders are wont to make themselves in their determination\r\nto see everything: and moreover I met by the way several of my gossips\r\nand friends that are ever wont to greet me, and ask me to drink, and\r\nnever a word said any of them to me, no, nor half a word either; but they\r\npassed me by as men that saw me not. But at last, being come home, I was\r\nmet and seen by this devil of a woman, curses upon her, forasmuch as all\r\nthings, as you know, lose their virtue in the presence of a woman;\r\nwhereby I from being the most lucky am become the most luckless man in\r\nFlorence: and therefore I thrashed her as long as I could stir a hand,\r\nnor know I wherefore I forbear to sluice her veins for her, cursed be the\r\nhour that first I saw her, cursed be the hour that I brought her into the\r\nhouse!\" And so, kindling with fresh wrath, he was about to start up and\r\ngive her another thrashing; when Buffalmacco and Bruno, who had listened\r\nto his story with an air of great surprise, and affirmed its truth again\r\nand again, while they all but burst with suppressed laughter, seeing him\r\nnow frantic to renew his assault upon his wife, got up and withstood and\r\nheld him back, averring that the lady was in no wise to blame for what\r\nhad happened, but only he, who, witting that things lost their virtue in\r\nthe presence of women, had not bidden her keep aloof from him that day;\r\nwhich precaution God had not suffered him to take, either because the\r\nluck was not to be his, or because he was minded to cheat his comrades,\r\nto whom he should have shewn the stone as soon as he found it. And so,\r\nwith many words they hardly prevailed upon him to forgive his injured\r\nwife, and leaving him to rue the ill-luck that had filled his house with\r\nstones, went their way.\r\n\r\n(1) A sort of rissole.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IV.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThe rector of Fiesole loves a widow lady, by whom he is not loved, and\r\nthinking to lie with her, lies with her maid, with whom the lady's\r\nbrothers cause him to be found by his Bishop.\r\n--\r\n\r\nElisa being come to the end of her story, which in the telling had\r\nyielded no small delight to all the company, the queen, turning to\r\nEmilia, signified her will, that her story should ensue at once upon that\r\nof Elisa. And thus with alacrity Emilia began:--Noble ladies, how we are\r\nteased and tormented by these priests and friars, and indeed by clergy of\r\nall sorts, I mind me to have been set forth in more than one of the\r\nstories that have been told; but as 'twere not possible to say so much\r\nthereof but that more would yet remain to say, I purpose to supplement\r\nthem with the story of a rector, who, in defiance of all the world, was\r\nbent upon having the favour of a gentlewoman, whether she would or no.\r\nWhich gentlewoman, being discreet above a little, treated him as he\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\nFiesole, whose hill is here within sight, is, as each of you knows, a\r\ncity of immense antiquity, and was aforetime great, though now 'tis\r\nfallen into complete decay; which notwithstanding, it always was, and\r\nstill is the see of a bishop. Now there was once a gentlewoman, Monna\r\nPiccarda by name, a widow, that had an estate at Fiesole, hard by the\r\ncathedral, on which, for that she was not in the easiest circumstances,\r\nshe lived most part of the year, and with her her two brothers, very\r\nworthy and courteous young men, both of them. And the lady being wont\r\nfrequently to resort to the cathedral, and being still quite young and\r\nfair and debonair withal, it so befell that the rector grew in the last\r\ndegree enamoured of her, and waxed at length so bold, that he himself\r\navowed his passion to the lady, praying her to entertain his love, and\r\nrequite it in like measure. The rector was advanced in years, but\r\notherwise the veriest springald, being bold and of a high spirit, of a\r\nboundless conceit of himself, and of mien and manners most affected and\r\nin the worst taste, and withal so tiresome and insufferable that he was\r\non bad terms with everybody, and, if with one person more than another,\r\nwith this lady, who not only cared not a jot for him, but had liefer have\r\nhad a headache than his company. Wherefore the lady discreetly made\r\nanswer:--\"I may well prize your love, Sir, and love you I should and will\r\nright gladly; but such love as yours and mine may never admit of aught\r\nthat is not honourable. You are my spiritual father and a priest, and now\r\nverging towards old age, circumstances which should ensure your honour\r\nand chastity; and I, on my part, am no longer a girl, such as these love\r\naffairs might beseem, but a widow, and well you wot how it behoves widows\r\nto be chaste. Wherefore I pray you to have me excused; for, after the\r\nsort you crave, you shall never have my love, nor would I in such sort be\r\nloved by you.\" With this answer the rector was for the nonce fain to be\r\ncontent; but he was not the man to be dismayed and routed by a first\r\nrepulse; and with his wonted temerity and effrontery he plied her again\r\nand again with letters and ambassages, and also by word of mouth, when he\r\nespied her entering the church. Wherefore the lady finding this\r\npersecution more grievous and harassing than she could well bear, cast\r\nabout how she might be quit thereof in such fashion as he deserved,\r\nseeing that he left her no choice; howbeit she would do nought in the\r\nmatter until she had conferred with her brothers. She therefore told them\r\nhow the rector pursued her, and how she meant to foil him; and, with\r\ntheir full concurrence, some few days afterwards she went, as she was\r\nwont, to church. The rector no sooner saw her, than he approached and\r\naccosted her, as he was wont, in a tone of easy familiarity. The lady\r\ngreeted him, as he came up, with a glance of gladsome recognition; and\r\nwhen he had treated her to not a little of his wonted eloquence, she drew\r\nhim aside, and heaving a great sigh, said:--\"I have oftentimes heard it\r\nsaid, Sir, that there is no castle so strong, but that, if the siege be\r\ncontinued day by day, it will sooner or later be taken; which I now\r\nplainly perceive is my own case. For so fairly have you hemmed me in with\r\nthis, that, and the other pretty speech or the like blandishments, that\r\nyou have constrained me to make nought of my former resolve, and, seeing\r\nthat I find such favour with you, to surrender myself unto you.\" Whereto,\r\noverjoyed, the rector made answer:--\"Madam, I am greatly honoured; and,\r\nsooth to say, I marvelled not a little how you should hold out so long,\r\nseeing that I have never had the like experience with any other woman,\r\ninsomuch that I have at times said:--'Were women of silver, they would\r\nnot be worth a denier, for there is none but would give under the\r\nhammer!' But no more of this: when and where may we come together?\"\r\n\"Sweet my lord,\" replied the lady, \"for the when, 'tis just as we may\r\nthink best, for I have no husband to whom to render account of my nights,\r\nbut the where passes my wit to conjecture.\" \"How so?\" quoth the rector.\r\n\"Why not in your own house?\" \"Sir,\" replied the lady, \"you know that I\r\nhave two brothers, both young men, who day and night bring their comrades\r\ninto the house, which is none too large: for which reason it might not be\r\ndone there, unless we were minded to make ourselves, as it were, dumb and\r\nblind, uttering never a word, not so much as a monosyllable, and abiding\r\nin the dark: in such sort indeed it might be, because they do not intrude\r\nupon my chamber; but theirs is so near to mine that the very least\r\nwhisper could not but be heard.\" \"Nay but, Madam,\" returned the rector,\r\n\"let not this stand in our way for a night or two, until I may bethink me\r\nwhere else we might be more at our ease.\" \"Be that as you will, Sir,\"\r\nquoth the lady, \"I do but entreat that the affair be kept close, so that\r\nnever a word of it get wind.\" \"Have no fear on that score, Madam,\"\r\nreplied the priest; \"and if so it may be, let us forgather to-night.\"\r\n\"With pleasure,\" returned the lady; and having appointed him how and when\r\nto come, she left him and went home.\r\n\r\nNow the lady had a maid, that was none too young, and had a countenance\r\nthe ugliest and most misshapen that ever was seen; for indeed she was\r\nflat-nosed, wry-mouthed, and thick-lipped, with huge, ill-set teeth, eyes\r\nthat squinted and were ever bleared, and a complexion betwixt green and\r\nyellow, that shewed as if she had spent the summer not at Fiesole but at\r\nSinigaglia: besides which she was hip-shot and somewhat halting on the\r\nright side. Her name was Ciuta, but, for that she was such a scurvy bitch\r\nto look upon, she was called by all folk Ciutazza.(1) And being thus\r\nmisshapen of body, she was also not without her share of guile. So the\r\nlady called her and said:--\"Ciutazza, so thou wilt do me a service\r\nto-night, I will give thee a fine new shift.\" At the mention of the shift\r\nCiutazza made answer:--\"So you give me a shift, Madam, I will throw\r\nmyself into the very fire.\" \"Good,\" said the lady; \"then I would have\r\nthee lie to-night in my bed with a man, whom thou wilt caress; but look\r\nthou say never a word, that my brothers, who, as thou knowest, sleep in\r\nthe next room, hear thee not; and afterwards I will give thee the shift.\"\r\n\"Sleep with a man!\" quoth Ciutazza: \"why, if need be, I will sleep with\r\nsix.\" So in the evening Master Rector came, as he had been bidden; and\r\nthe two young men, as the lady had arranged, being in their room, and\r\nmaking themselves very audible, he stole noiselessly, and in the dark,\r\ninto the lady's room, and got him on to the bed, which Ciutazza, well\r\nadvised by the lady how to behave, mounted from the other side. Whereupon\r\nMaster Rector, thinking to have the lady by his side, took Ciutazza in\r\nhis arms, and fell a kissing her, saying never a word the while, and\r\nCiutazza did the like; and so he enjoyed her, plucking the boon which he\r\nhad so long desired.\r\n\r\nThe rector and Ciutazza thus closeted, the lady charged her brothers to\r\nexecute the rest of her plan. They accordingly stole quietly out of their\r\nroom, and hied them to the piazza, where Fortune proved propitious beyond\r\nwhat they had craved of her; for, it being a very hot night, the bishop\r\nhad been seeking them, purposing to go home with them, and solace himself\r\nwith their society, and quench his thirst. With which desire he\r\nacquainted them, as soon as he espied them coming into the piazza; and so\r\nthey escorted him to their house, and there in the cool of their little\r\ncourtyard, which was bright with many a lamp, he took, to his no small\r\ncomfort, a draught of their good wine. Which done:--\"Sir,\" said the young\r\nmen, \"since of your great courtesy you have deigned to visit our poor\r\nhouse, to which we were but now about to invite you, we should be\r\ngratified if you would be pleased to give a look at somewhat, a mere\r\ntrifle though it be, which we have here to shew you.\" The bishop replied\r\nthat he would do so with pleasure. Whereupon one of the young men took a\r\nlighted torch and led the way, the bishop and the rest following, to the\r\nchamber where Master Rector lay with Ciutazza.\r\n\r\nNow the rector, being in hot haste, had ridden hard, insomuch that he was\r\nalready gotten above three miles on his way when they arrived; and so,\r\nbeing somewhat tired, he was resting, but, hot though the night was, he\r\nstill held Ciutazza in his arms. In which posture he was shewn to the\r\nbishop, when, preceded by the young man bearing the light, and followed\r\nby the others, he entered the chamber. And being roused, and observing\r\nthe light and the folk that stood about him, Master Rector was mighty\r\nashamed and affrighted, and popped his head under the clothes. But the\r\nbishop, reprimanding him severely, constrained him to thrust his head out\r\nagain, and take a view of his bed-fellow. Thus made aware of the trick\r\nwhich the lady had played him, the rector was now, both on that score and\r\nby reason of his signal disgrace, the saddest man that ever was; and his\r\ndiscomfiture was complete, when, having donned his clothes, he was\r\ncommitted by the bishop's command to close custody and sent to prison,\r\nthere to expiate his offence by a rigorous penance.\r\n\r\nThe bishop was then fain to know how it had come about that he had\r\nforgathered there with Ciutazza. Whereupon the young men related the\r\nwhole story; which ended, the bishop commended both the lady and the\r\nyoung men not a little, for that they had taken condign vengeance upon\r\nhim without imbruing their hands in the blood of a priest. The bishop\r\ncaused him to bewail his transgression forty days; but what with his\r\nlove, and the scornful requital which it had received, he bewailed it\r\nmore than forty and nine days, not to mention that for a great while he\r\ncould not shew himself in the street but the boys would point the finger\r\nat him and say:--\"There goes he that lay with Ciutazza.\" Which was such\r\nan affliction to him that he was like to go mad. On this wise the worthy\r\nlady rid herself of the rector's vexatious importunity, and Ciutazza had\r\na jolly night and earned her shift.\r\n\r\n(1) An augmentative form, with a suggestion of cagnazza, bitch-like.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL V.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThree young men pull down the breeches of a judge from the Marches, while\r\nhe is administering justice on the bench.\r\n--\r\n\r\nSo ended Emilia her story; and when all had commended the widow\r\nlady:--\"'Tis now thy turn to speak,\" quoth the queen, fixing her gaze\r\nupon Filostrato, who answered that he was ready, and forthwith thus\r\nbegan:--Sweet my ladies, by what I remember of that young man, to wit,\r\nMaso del Saggio, whom Elisa named a while ago, I am prompted to lay aside\r\na story that I had meant to tell you, and to tell you another, touching\r\nhim and some of his comrades, which, notwithstanding there are in it\r\ncertain words (albeit 'tis not unseemly) which your modesty forbears to\r\nuse, is yet so laughable that I shall relate it.\r\n\r\nAs you all may well have heard, there come not seldom to our city\r\nmagistrates from the Marches, who for the most part are men of a mean\r\nspirit, and in circumstances so reduced and beggarly, that their whole\r\nlife seems to be but a petty-foggery; and by reason of this their inbred\r\nsordidness and avarice they bring with them judges and notaries that have\r\nrather the air of men taken from the plough or the last than trained in\r\nthe schools of law.(1) Now one of these Marchers, being come hither as\r\nPodesta, brought with him judges not a few, and among them one that\r\ncalled himself Messer Niccola da San Lepidio, and looked liker to a\r\nlocksmith than aught else. However, this fellow was assigned with the\r\nrest of the judges to hear criminal causes. And as folk will often go to\r\nthe court, though they have no concern whatever there, it so befell that\r\nMaso del Saggio went thither one morning in quest of one of his friends,\r\nand there chancing to set eyes on this Messer Niccola, where he sate,\r\ndeemed him a fowl of no common feather, and surveyed him from head to\r\nfoot, observing that the vair which he wore on his head was all begrimed,\r\nthat he carried an ink-horn at his girdle, that his gown was longer than\r\nhis robe, and many another detail quite foreign to the appearance of a\r\nman of birth and breeding, of which that which he deemed most notable was\r\na pair of breeches, which, as he saw (for the judge's outer garments\r\nbeing none too ample were open in front, as he sate), reached half-way\r\ndown his legs. By which sight his mind was presently diverted from the\r\nfriend whom he came there to seek; and forth he hied him in quest of\r\nother two of his comrades, the one Ribi, the other Matteuzzo by name,\r\nfellows both of them not a whit less jolly than Maso himself; and having\r\nfound them, he said to them:--\"An you love me, come with me to the court,\r\nand I will shew you the queerest scarecrow that ever you saw.\" So the two\r\nmen hied them with him to the court; and there he pointed out to them the\r\njudge and his breeches. What they saw from a distance served to set them\r\nlaughing: then drawing nearer to the dais on which Master Judge was\r\nseated, they observed that 'twas easy enough to get under the dais, and\r\nmoreover that the plank, on which the judge's feet rested, was broken, so\r\nthat there was plenty of room for the passage of a hand and arm.\r\nWhereupon quoth Maso to his comrades:--\"'Twere a very easy matter to pull\r\nthese breeches right down: wherefore I propose that we do so.\" Each of\r\nthe men had marked how it might be done; and so, having concerted both\r\nwhat they should do and what they should say, they came to the court\r\nagain next morning; and, the court being crowded, Matteuzzo, observed by\r\nnever a soul, slipped beneath the dais, and posted himself right under\r\nthe spot where the judge's feet rested, while the other two men took\r\ntheir stand on either side of the judge, each laying hold of the hem of\r\nhis robe. Then:--\"Sir, sir, I pray you for God's sake,\" began Maso,\r\n\"that, before the pilfering rascal that is there beside you can make off,\r\nyou constrain him to give me back a pair of jack boots that he has stolen\r\nfrom me, which theft he still denies, though 'tis not a month since I saw\r\nhim getting them resoled.\" Meanwhile Ribi, at the top of his voice,\r\nshouted:--\"Believe him not, Sir, the scurvy knave! 'Tis but that he knows\r\nthat I am come to demand restitution of a valise that he has stolen from\r\nme that he now for the first time trumps up this story about a pair of\r\njack boots that I have had in my house down to the last day or two; and\r\nif you doubt what I say, I can bring as witness Trecca, my neighbour, and\r\nGrassa, the tripe-woman, and one that goes about gathering the sweepings\r\nof Santa Maria a Verzaia, who saw him when he was on his way back from\r\nthe farm.\" But shout as he might, Maso was still even with him, nor for\r\nall that did Ribi bate a jot of his clamour. And while the judge stood,\r\nbending now towards the one, now towards the other, the better to hear\r\nthem, Matteuzzo seized his opportunity, and thrusting his hand through\r\nthe hole in the plank caught hold of the judge's breeches, and tugged at\r\nthem amain. Whereby down they came straightway, for the judge was a lean\r\nman, and shrunk in the buttocks. The judge, being aware of the accident,\r\nbut knowing not how it had come about, would have gathered his outer\r\ngarments together in front, so as to cover the defect, but Maso on the\r\none side, and Ribi on the other, held him fast, shouting amain and in\r\nchorus:--\"You do me a grievous wrong, Sir, thus to deny me justice, nay,\r\neven a hearing, and to think of quitting the court: there needs no writ\r\nin this city for such a trifling matter as this.\" And thus they held him\r\nby the clothes and in parley, until all that were in the court perceived\r\nthat he had lost his breeches. However, after a while, Matteuzzo dropped\r\nthe breeches, and slipped off, and out of the court, without being\r\nobserved, and Ribi, deeming that the joke had gone far enough,\r\nexclaimed:--\"By God, I vow, I will appeal to the Syndics;\" while Maso, on\r\nthe other side, let go the robe, saying:--\"Nay, but for my part, I will\r\ncome here again and again and again, until I find you less embarrassed\r\nthan you seem to be to-day.\" And so the one this way, the other that way,\r\nthey made off with all speed. Whereupon Master Judge, disbreeched before\r\nall the world, was as one that awakens from sleep, albeit he was ware of\r\nhis forlorn condition, and asked whither the parties in the case touching\r\nthe jack boots and the valise were gone. However, as they were not to be\r\nfound, he fell a swearing by the bowels of God, that 'twas meet and\r\nproper that he should know and wit, whether 'twas the custom at Florence\r\nto disbreech judges sitting in the seat of justice.\r\n\r\nWhen the affair reached the ears of the Podesta, he made no little stir\r\nabout it; but, being informed by some of his friends, that 'twould not\r\nhave happened, but that the Florentines were minded to shew him, that, in\r\nplace of the judges he should have brought with him, he had brought but\r\ngowks, to save expense, he deemed it best to say no more about it, and so\r\nfor that while the matter went no further.\r\n\r\n(1) It was owing to their internal dissensions that the Florentines were\r\nfrom time to time fain to introduce these stranger Podestas.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VI.\r\n\r\n--\r\nBruno and Buffalmacco steal a pig from Calandrino, and induce him to\r\nessay its recovery by means of pills of ginger and vernaccia. Of the said\r\npills they give him two, one after the other, made of dog-ginger\r\ncompounded with aloes; and it then appearing as if he had had the pig\r\nhimself, they constrain him to buy them off, if he would not have them\r\ntell his wife.\r\n--\r\n\r\nFilostrato's story, which elicited not a little laughter, was no sooner\r\nended, than the queen bade Filomena follow suit. Wherefore thus Filomena\r\nbegan:--As, gracious ladies, 'twas the name of Maso del Saggio that\r\nprompted Filostrato to tell the story that you have but now heard, even\r\nso 'tis with me in regard of Calandrino and his comrades, of whom I am\r\nminded to tell you another story, which you will, I think, find\r\nentertaining. Who Calandrino, Bruno and Buffalmacco were, I need not\r\nexplain; you know them well enough from the former story; and therefore I\r\nwill tarry no longer than to say that Calandrino had a little estate not\r\nfar from Florence, which his wife had brought him by way of dowry, and\r\nwhich yielded them yearly, among other matters, a pig; and 'twas his\r\ncustom every year in the month of December to resort to the farm with his\r\nwife, there to see to the killing and salting of the said pig. Now, one\r\nof these years it so happened that his wife being unwell, Calandrino went\r\nthither alone to kill the pig. And Bruno and Buffalmacco learning that he\r\nwas gone to the farm, and that his wife was not with him, betook them to\r\nthe house of a priest that was their especial friend and a neighbour of\r\nCalandrino, there to tarry a while. Upon their arrival Calandrino, who\r\nhad that very morning killed the pig, met them with the priest, and\r\naccosted them, saying:--\"A hearty welcome to you. I should like you to\r\nsee what an excellent manager I am;\" and so he took them into his house,\r\nand shewed them the pig. They observed that 'twas a very fine pig; and\r\nlearned from Calandrino that he was minded to salt it for household\r\nconsumption. \"Then thou art but a fool,\" quoth Bruno. \"Sell it, man, and\r\nlet us have a jolly time with the money; and tell thy wife that 'twas\r\nstolen.\" \"Not I,\" replied Calandrino: \"she would never believe me, and\r\nwould drive me out of the house. Urge me no further, for I will never do\r\nit.\" The others said a great deal more, but to no purpose; and Calandrino\r\nbade them to supper, but so coldly that they declined, and left him.\r\n\r\nPresently:--\"Should we not steal this pig from him to-night?\" quoth Bruno\r\nto Buffalmacco. \"Could we so?\" returned Buffalmacco. \"How?\" \"Why, as to\r\nthat,\" rejoined Bruno, \"I have already marked how it may be done, if he\r\nbestow not the pig elsewhere.\" \"So be it, then,\" said Buffalmacco: \"we\r\nwill steal it; and then, perchance, our good host, Master Priest, will\r\njoin us in doing honour to such good cheer?\" \"That right gladly will I,\"\r\nquoth the priest. Whereupon:--\"Some address, though,\" quoth Bruno, \"will\r\nbe needful: thou knowest, Buffalmacco, what a niggardly fellow Calandrino\r\nis, and how greedily he drinks at other folk's expense. Go we, therefore,\r\nand take him to the tavern, and there let the priest make as if, to do us\r\nhonour, he would pay the whole score, and suffer Calandrino to pay never\r\na soldo, and he will grow tipsy, and then we shall speed excellent well,\r\nbecause he is alone in the house.\"\r\n\r\nAs Bruno proposed, so they did: and Calandrino, finding that the priest\r\nwould not suffer him to pay, drank amain, and took a great deal more\r\naboard than he had need of; and the night being far spent when he left\r\nthe tavern, he dispensed with supper, and went home, and thinking to have\r\nshut the door, got him to bed, leaving it open. Buffalmacco and Bruno\r\nwent to sup with the priest; and after supper, taking with them certain\r\nimplements with which to enter Calandrino's house, where Bruno thought it\r\nmost feasible, they stealthily approached it; but finding the door open,\r\nthey entered, and took down the pig, and carried it away to the priest's\r\nhouse, and having there bestowed it safely, went to bed. In the morning\r\nwhen Calandrino, his head at length quit of the fumes of the wine, got\r\nup, and came downstairs and found that his pig was nowhere to be seen,\r\nand that the door was open, he asked this, that, and the other man,\r\nwhether they wist who had taken the pig away, and getting no answer, he\r\nbegan to make a great outcry:--\"Alas, alas! luckless man that I am, that\r\nmy pig should have been stolen from me!\" Meanwhile Bruno and Buffalmacco,\r\nbeing also risen, made up to him, to hear what he would say touching the\r\npig. Whom he no sooner saw, than well-nigh weeping he called them,\r\nsaying:--\"Alas! my friends! my pig is stolen from me.\" Bruno stepped up\r\nto him and said in a low tone:--\"'Tis passing strange if thou art in the\r\nright for once.\" \"Alas!\" returned Calandrino, \"what I say is but too\r\ntrue.\" \"Why, then, out with it, man,\" quoth Bruno, \"cry aloud, that all\r\nfolk may know that 'tis so.\" Calandrino then raised his voice and\r\nsaid:--\"By the body o' God I say of a truth that my pig has been stolen\r\nfrom me.\" \"So!\" quoth Bruno, \"but publish it, man, publish it; lift up\r\nthy voice, make thyself well heard, that all may believe thy report.\"\r\n\"Thou art enough to make me give my soul to the Enemy,\" replied\r\nCalandrino. \"I say--dost not believe me?--that hang me by the neck if the\r\npig is not stolen from me!\" \"Nay, but,\" quoth Bruno, \"how can it be? I\r\nsaw it here but yesterday. Dost think to make me believe that it has\r\ntaken to itself wings and flown away?\" \"All the same 'tis as I tell\r\nthee,\" returned Calandrino. \"Is it possible?\" quoth Bruno. \"Ay indeed,\"\r\nreplied Calandrino; \"'tis even so: and I am undone, and know not how to\r\ngo home. Never will my wife believe me; or if she do so, I shall know no\r\npeace this year.\" \"Upon my hope of salvation,\" quoth Bruno, \"'tis indeed\r\na bad business, if so it really is. But thou knowest, Calandrino, that\r\n'twas but yesterday I counselled thee to make believe that 'twas so. I\r\nshould be sorry to think thou didst befool thy wife and us at the same\r\ntime.\" \"Ah!\" vociferated Calandrino, \"wilt thou drive me to despair and\r\nprovoke me to blaspheme God and the saints and all the company of heaven?\r\nI tell thee that the pig has been stolen from me in the night.\"\r\nWhereupon:--\"If so it be,\" quoth Buffalmacco, \"we must find a way, if we\r\ncan, to recover it.\" \"Find a way?\" said Calandrino: \"how can we compass\r\nthat?\" \"Why,\" replied Buffalmacco, \"'tis certain that no one has come\r\nfrom India to steal thy pig: it must have been one of thy neighbours, and\r\nif thou couldst bring them together, I warrant thee, I know how to make\r\nthe assay with bread and cheese, and we will find out in a trice who has\r\nhad the pig.\" \"Ay,\" struck in Bruno, \"make thy assay with bread and\r\ncheese in the presence of these gentry hereabout, one of whom I am sure\r\nhas had the pig! why, the thing would be seen through: and they would not\r\ncome.\" \"What shall we do, then?\" said Buffalmacco. Whereto Bruno made\r\nanswer:--\"It must be done with good pills of ginger and good vernaccia;\r\nand they must be bidden come drink with us. They will suspect nothing,\r\nand will come; and pills of ginger can be blessed just as well as bread\r\nand cheese.\" \"Beyond a doubt, thou art right,\" quoth Buffalmacco; \"and\r\nthou Calandrino, what sayst thou? Shall we do as Bruno says?\" \"Nay, I\r\nentreat you for the love of God,\" quoth Calandrino, \"do even so: for if I\r\nknew but who had had the pig, I should feel myself half consoled for my\r\nloss.\" \"Go to, now,\" quoth Bruno, \"I am willing to do thy errand to\r\nFlorence for these commodities, if thou givest me the money.\"\r\n\r\nCalandrino had some forty soldi upon him, which he gave to Bruno, who\r\nthereupon hied him to Florence to a friend of his that was an apothecary,\r\nand bought a pound of good pills of ginger, two of which, being of\r\ndog-ginger, he caused to be compounded with fresh hepatic aloes, and then\r\nto be coated with sugar like the others; and lest they should be lost, or\r\nany of the others mistaken for them, he had a slight mark set upon them\r\nby which he might readily recognize them. He also bought a flask of good\r\nvernaccia, and, thus laden, returned to the farm, and said to\r\nCalandrino:--\"To-morrow morning thou wilt bid those whom thou suspectest\r\ncome hither to drink with thee: as 'twill be a saint's day, they will all\r\ncome readily enough; and to-night I and Buffalmacco will say the\r\nincantation over the pills, which in the morning I will bring to thee\r\nhere, and for our friendship's sake will administer them myself, and do\r\nand say all that needs to be said and done.\" So Calandrino did as Bruno\r\nadvised, and on the morrow a goodly company, as well of young men from\r\nFlorence, that happened to be in the village, as of husbandmen, being\r\nassembled in front of the church around the elm, Bruno and Buffalmacco\r\ncame, bearing a box containing the ginger, and the flask of wine, and\r\nranged the folk in a circle. Whereupon: \"Gentlemen,\" said Bruno, \"'tis\r\nmeet I tell you the reason why you are gathered here, that if aught\r\nunpleasant to you should befall, you may have no ground for complaint\r\nagainst me. Calandrino here was the night before last robbed of a fine\r\npig, and cannot discover who has had it; and, for that it must have been\r\nstolen by some one of us here, he would have each of you take and eat one\r\nof these pills and drink of this vernaccia. Wherefore I forthwith do you\r\nto wit, that whoso has had the pig will not be able to swallow the pill,\r\nbut will find it more bitter than poison, and will spit it out; and so,\r\nrather, than he should suffer this shame in presence of so many, 'twere\r\nperhaps best that he that has had the pig should confess the fact to the\r\npriest, and I will wash my hands of the affair.\"\r\n\r\nAll professed themselves ready enough to eat the pills; and so, having\r\nset them in a row with Calandrino among them, Bruno, beginning at one\r\nend, proceeded to give each a pill, and when he came to Calandrino he\r\nchose one of the pills of dog-ginger and put it in his hand. Calandrino\r\nthrust it forthwith between his teeth and began to chew it; but no sooner\r\nwas his tongue acquainted with the aloes, than, finding the bitterness\r\nintolerable, he spat it out. Now, the eyes of all the company being fixed\r\non one another to see who should spit out his pill, Bruno, who, not\r\nhaving finished the distribution, feigned to be concerned with nought\r\nelse, heard some one in his rear say:--\"Ha! Calandrino, what means this?\"\r\nand at once turning round, and marking that Calandrino had spit out his\r\npill:--\"Wait a while,\" quoth he, \"perchance 'twas somewhat else that\r\ncaused thee to spit: take another;\" and thereupon whipping out the other\r\npill of dog-ginger, he set it between Calandrino's teeth, and finished\r\nthe distribution. Bitter as Calandrino had found the former pill, he\r\nfound this tenfold more so; but being ashamed to spit it out, he kept it\r\na while in his mouth and chewed it, and, as he did so, tears stood in his\r\neyes that shewed as large as filberts, and at length, being unable to\r\nbear it any longer, he spat it out, as he had its predecessor. Which\r\nbeing observed by Buffalmacco and Bruno, who were then administering the\r\nwine, and by all the company, 'twas averred by common consent that\r\nCalandrino had committed the theft himself; for which cause certain of\r\nthem took him severely to task.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company being dispersed, and Bruno and Buffalmacco left\r\nalone with Calandrino, Buffalmacco began on this wise:--\"I never doubted\r\nbut that thou hadst had it thyself, and wast minded to make us believe\r\nthat it had been stolen from thee, that we might not have of thee so much\r\nas a single drink out of the price which thou gottest for it.\"\r\nCalandrino, with the bitterness of the aloes still on his tongue, fell a\r\nswearing that he had not had it. Whereupon:--\"Nay, but, comrade,\" quoth\r\nBuffalmacco, \"upon thy honour, what did it fetch? Six florins?\" Whereto,\r\nCalandrino being now on the verge of desperation, Bruno added:--\"Now be\r\nreasonable, Calandrino; among the company that ate and drank with us\r\nthere was one that told me that thou hadst up there a girl that thou\r\ndidst keep for thy pleasure, giving her what by hook or by crook thou\r\ncouldst get together, and that he held it for certain that thou hadst\r\nsent her this pig. And thou art grown expert in this sort of cozenage.\r\nThou tookest us one while adown the Mugnone a gathering black stones, and\r\nhaving thus started us on a wild-goose chase, thou madest off; and then\r\nwouldst fain have us believe that thou hadst found the stone: and now, in\r\nlike manner, thou thinkest by thine oaths to persuade us that this pig\r\nwhich thou hast given away or sold, has been stolen from thee. But we\r\nknow thy tricks of old; never another couldst thou play us; and, to be\r\nround with thee, this spell has cost us some trouble: wherefore we mean\r\nthat thou shalt give us two pair of capons, or we will let Monna Tessa\r\nknow all.\" Seeing that he was not believed, and deeming his mortification\r\nample without the addition of his wife's resentment, Calandrino gave them\r\nthe two pair of capons, with which, when the pig was salted, they\r\nreturned to Florence, leaving Calandrino with the loss and the laugh\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nA scholar loves a widow lady, who, being enamoured of another, causes him\r\nto spend a winter's night awaiting her in the snow. He afterwards by a\r\nstratagem causes her to stand for a whole day in July, naked upon a\r\ntower, exposed to the flies, the gadflies, and the sun.\r\n--\r\n\r\nOver the woes of poor Calandrino the ladies laughed not a little, and had\r\nlaughed yet more, but that it irked them that those that had robbed him\r\nof the pig should also take from him the capons. However, the story being\r\nended, the queen bade Pampinea give them hers: and thus forthwith\r\nPampinea began:--Dearest ladies, it happens oftentimes that the artful\r\nscorner meets his match; wherefore 'tis only little wits that delight to\r\nscorn. In a series of stories we have heard tell of tricks played without\r\naught in the way of reprisals following: by mine I purpose in some degree\r\nto excite your compassion for a gentlewoman of our city (albeit the\r\nretribution that came upon her was but just) whose flout was returned in\r\nthe like sort, and to such effect that she well-nigh died thereof. The\r\nwhich to hear will not be unprofitable to you, for thereby you will learn\r\nto be more careful how you flout others, and therein you will do very\r\nwisely.\r\n\r\n'Tis not many years since there dwelt at Florence a lady young and fair,\r\nand of a high spirit, as also of right gentle lineage, and tolerably well\r\nendowed with temporal goods. Now Elena--such was the lady's name--being\r\nleft a widow, was minded never to marry again, being enamoured of a\r\nhandsome young gallant of her own choosing, with whom she, recking nought\r\nof any other lover, did, by the help of a maid in whom she placed much\r\ntrust, not seldom speed the time gaily and with marvellous delight.\r\nMeanwhile it so befell that a young nobleman of our city, Rinieri by\r\nname, who had spent much time in study at Paris, not that he might\r\nthereafter sell his knowledge by retail, but that he might learn the\r\nreasons and causes of things, which accomplishment shews to most\r\nexcellent advantage in a gentleman, returned to Florence, and there lived\r\nas a citizen in no small honour with his fellows, both by reason of his\r\nrank and of his learning. But as it is often the case that those who are\r\nmost versed in deep matters are the soonest mastered by Love, so was it\r\nwith Rinieri. For at a festal gathering, to which one day he went, there\r\nappeared before his eyes this Elena, of whom we spoke, clad in black, as\r\nis the wont of our Florentine widows, and shewing to his mind so much\r\nfairer and more debonair than any other woman that he had ever seen, that\r\nhappy indeed he deemed the man might call himself, to whom God in His\r\ngoodness should grant the right to hold her naked in his arms. So now and\r\nagain he eyed her stealthily, and knowing that boons goodly and precious\r\nare not to be gotten without trouble, he made up his mind to study and\r\nlabour with all assiduity how best to please her, that so he might win\r\nher love, and thereby the enjoyment of her.\r\n\r\nThe young gentlewoman was not used to keep her eyes bent ever towards the\r\ninfernal regions; but, rating herself at no less, if not more, than her\r\ndeserts, she was dexterous to move them to and fro, and thus busily\r\nscanning her company, soon detected the men who regarded her with\r\npleasure. By which means having discovered Rinieri's passion, she inly\r\nlaughed, and said:--'Twill turn out that 'twas not for nothing that I\r\ncame here to-day, for, if I mistake not, I have caught a gander by the\r\nbill. So she gave him an occasional sidelong glance, and sought as best\r\nshe might to make him believe that she was not indifferent to him,\r\ndeeming that the more men she might captivate by her charms, the higher\r\nthose charms would be rated, and most especially by him whom she had made\r\nlord of them and her love. The erudite scholar bade adieu to\r\nphilosophical meditation, for the lady entirely engrossed his mind; and,\r\nhaving discovered her house, he, thinking to please her, found divers\r\npretexts for frequently passing by it. Whereon the lady, her vanity\r\nflattered for the reason aforesaid, plumed herself not a little, and\r\nshewed herself pleased to see him. Thus encouraged, the scholar found\r\nmeans to make friends with her maid, to whom he discovered his love,\r\npraying her to do her endeavour with her mistress, that he might have her\r\nfavour. The maid was profuse of promises, and gave her mistress his\r\nmessage, which she no sooner heard, than she was convulsed with laughter,\r\nand replied:--\"He brought sense enough hither from Paris: knowest thou\r\nwhere he has since been to lose it? Go to, now; let us give him that\r\nwhich he seeks. Tell him, when he next speaks to you of the matter, that\r\nI love him vastly more than he loves me, but that I must have regard to\r\nmy reputation, so that I may be able to hold my head up among other\r\nladies; which, if he is really the wise man they say, will cause him to\r\naffect me much more.\" Ah! poor woman! poor woman! she little knew, my\r\nladies, how rash it is to try conclusions with scholars.\r\n\r\nThe maid found the scholar, and did her mistress's errand. The scholar,\r\noverjoyed, proceeded to urge his suit with more ardour, to indite\r\nletters, and send presents. The lady received all that he sent her, but\r\nvouchsafed no answers save such as were couched in general terms: and on\r\nthis wise she kept him dangling a long while. At last, having disclosed\r\nthe whole affair to her lover, who evinced some resentment and jealousy,\r\nshe, to convince him that his suspicions were groundless, and for that\r\nshe was much importuned by the scholar, sent word to him by her maid,\r\nthat never since he had assured her of his love, had occasion served her\r\nto do him pleasure, but that next Christmastide she hoped to be with him;\r\nwherefore, if he were minded to await her in the courtyard of her house\r\non the night of the day next following the feast, she would meet him\r\nthere as soon as she could. Elated as ne'er another, the scholar hied him\r\nat the appointed time to the lady's house, and being ushered into a\r\ncourtyard by the maid, who forthwith turned the key upon him, addressed\r\nhimself there to await the lady's coming.\r\n\r\nNow the lady's lover, by her appointment, was with her that evening; and,\r\nwhen they had gaily supped, she told him what she had in hand that night,\r\nadding:--\"And so thou wilt be able to gauge the love which I have borne\r\nand bear this scholar, whom thou hast foolishly regarded as a rival.\" The\r\nlover heard the lady's words with no small delight, and waited in eager\r\nexpectancy to see her make them good. The scholar, hanging about there in\r\nthe courtyard, began to find it somewhat chillier than he would have\r\nliked, for it had snowed hard all day long, so that the snow lay\r\neverywhere thick on the ground; however, he bore it patiently, expecting\r\nto be recompensed by and by. After a while the lady said to her\r\nlover:--\"Go we to the chamber and take a peep through a lattice at him of\r\nwhom thou art turned jealous, and mark what he does, and how he will\r\nanswer the maid, whom I have bidden go speak with him.\" So the pair hied\r\nthem to a lattice, wherethrough they could see without being seen, and\r\nheard the maid call from another lattice to the scholar,\r\nsaying:--\"Rinieri, my lady is distressed as never woman was, for that one\r\nof her brothers is come here to-night, and after talking a long while\r\nwith her, must needs sup with her, and is not yet gone, but, I think, he\r\nwill soon be off; and that is the reason why she has not been able to\r\ncome to thee, but she will come soon now. She trusts it does not irk thee\r\nto wait so long.\" Whereto the scholar, supposing that 'twas true, made\r\nanswer:--\"Tell my lady to give herself no anxiety on my account, until\r\nshe can conveniently come to me, but to do so as soon as she may.\"\r\nWhereupon the maid withdrew from the window, and went to bed; while the\r\nlady said to her lover:--\"Now, what sayst thou? Thinkst thou that, if I\r\nhad that regard for him, which thou fearest, I would suffer him to tarry\r\nbelow there to get frozen?\" Which said, the lady and her now partly\r\nreassured lover got them to bed, where for a great while they disported\r\nthem right gamesomely, laughing together and making merry over the\r\nluckless scholar.\r\n\r\nThe scholar, meanwhile, paced up and down the courtyard to keep himself\r\nwarm, nor indeed had he where to sit, or take shelter: in this plight he\r\nbestowed many a curse upon the lady's brother for his long tarrying, and\r\nnever a sound did he hear but he thought that 'twas the lady opening the\r\ndoor. But vain indeed were his hopes: the lady, having solaced herself\r\nwith her lover until hard upon midnight, then said to him:--\"How ratest\r\nthou our scholar, my soul? whether is the greater his wit, or the love I\r\nbear him, thinkst thou? Will the cold, that, of my ordaining, he now\r\nsuffers, banish from thy breast the suspicion which my light words the\r\nother day implanted there?\" \"Ay, indeed, heart of my body!\" replied the\r\nlover, \"well wot I now that even as thou art to me, my weal, my\r\nconsolation, my bliss, so am I to thee.\" \"So:\" quoth the lady, \"then I\r\nmust have full a thousand kisses from thee, to prove that thou sayst\r\nsooth.\" The lover's answer was to strain her to his heart, and give her\r\nnot merely a thousand but a hundred thousand kisses. In such converse\r\nthey dallied a while longer, and then:--\"Get we up, now,\" quoth the lady,\r\n\"that we may go see if 'tis quite spent, that fire, with which, as he\r\nwrote to me daily, this new lover of mine used to burn.\" So up they got\r\nand hied them to the lattice which they had used before, and peering out\r\ninto the courtyard, saw the scholar dancing a hornpipe to the music that\r\nhis own teeth made, a chattering for extremity of cold; nor had they ever\r\nseen it footed so nimbly and at such a pace. Whereupon:--\"How sayst thou,\r\nsweet my hope?\" quoth the lady. \"Know I not how to make men dance without\r\nthe aid of either trumpet or cornemuse?\" \"Indeed thou dost my heart's\r\ndelight,\" replied the lover. Quoth then the lady:--\"I have a mind that we\r\ngo down to the door. Thou wilt keep quiet, and I will speak to him, and\r\nwe shall hear what he says, which, peradventure, we shall find no less\r\ndiverting than the sight of him.\"\r\n\r\nSo they stole softly out of the chamber and down to the door, which\r\nleaving fast closed, the lady set her lips to a little hole that was\r\nthere, and with a low voice called the scholar, who, hearing her call\r\nhim, praised God, making too sure that he was to be admitted, and being\r\ncome to the door, said:--\"Here am I, Madam; open for God's sake; let me\r\nin, for I die of cold.\" \"Oh! ay,\" replied the lady, \"I know thou hast a\r\nchill, and of course, there being a little snow about, 'tis mighty cold;\r\nbut well I wot the nights are colder far at Paris. I cannot let thee in\r\nas yet, because my accursed brother, that came to sup here this evening,\r\nis still with me; but he will soon take himself off, and then I will let\r\nthee in without a moment's delay. I have but now with no small difficulty\r\ngiven him the slip, to come and give thee heart that the waiting irk thee\r\nnot.\" \"Nay but, Madam,\" replied the scholar, \"for the love of God, I\r\nentreat you, let me in, that I may have a roof over my head, because for\r\nsome time past there has been never so thick a fall of snow, and 'tis yet\r\nsnowing; and then I will wait as long as you please.\" \"Alas! sweet my\r\nlove,\" quoth the lady, \"that I may not, for this door makes such a din,\r\nwhen one opens it, that my brother would be sure to hear, were I to let\r\nthee in; but I will go tell him to get him gone, and so come back and\r\nadmit thee.\" \"Go at once, then,\" returned the scholar, \"and prithee, see\r\nthat a good fire be kindled, that, when I get in, I may warm myself, for\r\nI am now so chilled through and through that I have scarce any feeling\r\nleft.\" \"That can scarce be,\" rejoined the lady, \"if it be true, what thou\r\nhast so protested in thy letters, that thou art all afire for love of me:\r\n'tis plain to me now that thou didst but mock me. I now take my leave of\r\nthee: wait and be of good cheer.\"\r\n\r\nSo the lady and her lover, who, to his immense delight, had heard all\r\nthat passed, betook them to bed; however, little sleep had they that\r\nnight, but spent the best part of it in disporting themselves and making\r\nmerry over the unfortunate scholar, who, his teeth now chattering to such\r\na tune that he seemed to have been metamorphosed into a stork, perceived\r\nthat he had been befooled, and after making divers fruitless attempts to\r\nopen the door and seeking means of egress to no better purpose, paced to\r\nand fro like a lion, cursing the villainous weather, the long night, his\r\nsimplicity, and the perversity of the lady, against whom (the vehemence\r\nof his wrath suddenly converting the love he had so long borne her to\r\nbitter and remorseless enmity) he now plotted within himself divers and\r\ngrand schemes of revenge, on which he was far more bent than ever he had\r\nbeen on forgathering with her.\r\n\r\nSlowly the night wore away, and with the first streaks of dawn the maid,\r\nby her mistress's direction, came down, opened the door of the courtyard,\r\nand putting on a compassionate air, greeted Rinieri with:--\"Foul fall him\r\nthat came here yestereve; he has afflicted us with his presence all night\r\nlong, and has kept thee a freezing out here: but harkye, take it not\r\namiss; that which might not be to-night shall be another time: well wot I\r\nthat nought could have befallen that my lady could so ill brook.\" For all\r\nhis wrath, the scholar, witting, like the wise man he was, that menaces\r\nserve but to put the menaced on his guard, kept pent within his breast\r\nthat which unbridled resentment would have uttered, and said quietly, and\r\nwithout betraying the least trace of anger:--\"In truth 'twas the worst\r\nnight I ever spent, but I understood quite well that the lady was in no\r\nwise to blame, for that she herself, being moved to pity of me, came down\r\nhere to make her excuses, and to comfort me; and, as thou sayst, what has\r\nnot been to-night will be another time: wherefore commend me to her, and\r\nso, adieu!\" Then, well-nigh paralysed for cold, he got him, as best he\r\nmight, home, where, weary and fit to die for drowsiness, he threw himself\r\non his bed, and fell into a deep sleep, from which he awoke to find that\r\nhe had all but lost the use of his arms and legs. He therefore sent for\r\nsome physicians, and having told them what a chill he had gotten, caused\r\nthem have a care to his health. But, though they treated him with active\r\nand most drastic remedies, it cost them some time and no little trouble\r\nto restore to the cramped muscles their wonted pliancy, and, indeed, but\r\nfor his youth and the milder weather that was at hand, 'twould have gone\r\nvery hard with him.\r\n\r\nHowever, recover he did his health and lustihood, and nursing his enmity,\r\nfeigned to be vastly more enamoured of his widow than ever before. And so\r\nit was that after a while Fortune furnished him with an opportunity of\r\nsatisfying his resentment, for the gallant of whom the widow was\r\nenamoured, utterly regardless of the love she bore him, grew enamoured of\r\nanother lady, and was minded no more to pleasure the widow in aught\r\neither by word or by deed; wherefore she now pined in tears and\r\nbitterness of spirit. However, her maid, who commiserated her not a\r\nlittle, and knew not how to dispel the dumps that the loss of her lover\r\nhad caused her, espying the scholar pass along the street, as he had been\r\nwont, conceived the silly idea that the lady's lover might be induced to\r\nreturn to his old love by some practice of a necromantic order, wherein\r\nshe doubted not that the scholar must be a thorough adept; which idea she\r\nimparted to her mistress. The lady, being none too well furnished with\r\nsense, never thinking that, if the scholar had been an adept in\r\nnecromancy, he would have made use of it in his own behoof, gave heed to\r\nwhat her maid said, and forthwith bade her learn of the scholar whether\r\nhe would place his skill at her service, and assure him that, if he so\r\ndid, she, in guerdon thereof, would do his pleasure. The maid did her\r\nmistress's errand well and faithfully. The scholar no sooner heard the\r\nmessage, than he said to himself:--Praised be Thy name, O God, that the\r\ntime is now come, when with Thy help I may be avenged upon this wicked\r\nwoman of the wrong she did me in requital of the great love I bore her.\r\nThen, turning to the maid, he said:--\"Tell my lady to set her mind at\r\nease touching this matter; for that, were her lover in India, I would\r\nforthwith bring him hither to crave her pardon of that wherein he has\r\noffended her. As to the course she should take in the matter, I tarry but\r\nher pleasure to make it known to her, when and where she may think fit:\r\ntell her so, and bid her from me to be of good cheer.\" The maid carried\r\nhis answer to her mistress, and arranged that they should meet in the\r\nchurch of Santa Lucia of Prato. Thither accordingly they came, the lady\r\nand the scholar, and conversed apart, and the lady, quite oblivious of\r\nthe ill-usage by which she had well-nigh done him to death, opened all\r\nher mind to him, and besought him, if he had any regard to her welfare,\r\nto aid her to the attainment of her desire. \"Madam,\" replied the scholar,\r\n\"true it is that among other lore that I acquired at Paris was this of\r\nnecromancy, whereof, indeed, I know all that may be known; but, as 'tis\r\nin the last degree displeasing to God, I had sworn never to practise it\r\neither for my own or for any other's behoof. 'Tis also true that the love\r\nI bear you is such that I know not how to refuse you aught that you would\r\nhave me do for you; and so, were this single essay enough to consign me\r\nto hell, I would adventure it to pleasure you. But I mind me that 'tis a\r\nmatter scarce so easy of performance as, perchance, you suppose, most\r\nespecially when a woman would fain recover the love of a man, or a man\r\nthat of a woman, for then it must be done by the postulant in proper\r\nperson, and at night, and in lonely places, and unattended, so that it\r\nneeds a stout heart; nor know I whether you are disposed to comply with\r\nthese conditions.\" The lady, too enamoured to be discreet, made\r\nanswer:--\"So shrewdly does Love goad me, that there is nought I would not\r\ndo to bring him back to me who wrongfully has deserted me; but tell me,\r\nprithee, wherein it is that I have need of this stout heart.\" \"Madam,\"\r\nreturned the despiteful scholar, \"'twill be my part to fashion in tin an\r\nimage of him you would fain lure back to you: and when I have sent you\r\nthe image, 'twill be for you, when the moon is well on the wane, to dip\r\nyourself, being stark naked, and the image, seven times in a flowing\r\nstream, and this you must do quite alone about the hour of first sleep,\r\nand afterwards, still naked, you must get you upon some tree or some\r\ndeserted house, and facing the North, with the image in your hand, say\r\ncertain words that I shall give you in writing seven times; which, when\r\nyou have done, there will come to you two damsels, the fairest you ever\r\nsaw, who will greet you graciously, and ask of you what you would fain\r\nhave; to whom you will disclose frankly and fully all that you crave; and\r\nsee to it that you make no mistake in the name; and when you have said\r\nall, they will depart, and you may then descend and return to the spot\r\nwhere you left your clothes, and resume them and go home. And rest\r\nassured, that before the ensuing midnight your lover will come to you in\r\ntears, and crave your pardon and mercy, and that thenceforth he will\r\nnever again desert you for any other woman.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady gave entire credence to the scholar's words, and deeming her\r\nlover as good as in her arms again, recovered half her wonted spirits:\r\nwherefore:--\"Make no doubt,\" quoth she, \"that I shall do as thou biddest;\r\nand indeed I am most favoured by circumstance; for in upper Val d'Arno I\r\nhave an estate adjoining the river, and 'tis now July, so that to bathe\r\nwill be delightful. Ay, and now I mind me that at no great distance from\r\nthe river there is a little tower, which is deserted, save that now and\r\nagain the shepherds will get them up by the chestnut-wood ladder to the\r\nroof, thence to look out for their strayed sheep; 'tis a place lonely\r\nindeed, and quite out of ken; and when I have clomb it, as climb it I\r\nwill, I doubt not 'twill be the best place in all the world to give\r\neffect to your instructions.\"\r\n\r\nWell pleased to be certified of the lady's intention, the scholar, to\r\nwhom her estate and the tower were very well known, made answer:--\"I was\r\nnever in those parts, Madam, and therefore know neither your estate nor\r\nthe tower, but, if 'tis as you say, 'twill certainly be the best place in\r\nthe world for your purpose. So, when time shall serve, I will send you\r\nthe image and the orison. But I pray you, when you shall have your\r\nheart's desire, and know that I have done you good service, do not forget\r\nme, but keep your promise to me.\" \"That will I without fail,\" quoth the\r\nlady; and so she bade him farewell, and went home. The scholar, gleefully\r\nanticipating the success of his enterprise, fashioned an image, and\r\ninscribed it with certain magical signs, and wrote some gibberish by way\r\nof orison, which in due time he sent to the lady, bidding her the very\r\nnext night do as he had prescribed: and thereupon he hied him privily\r\nwith one of his servants to the house of a friend hard by the tower,\r\nthere to carry his purpose into effect. The lady, on her part, set out\r\nwith her maid, and betook her to her estate, and, night being come, sent\r\nthe maid to bed, as if she were minded to go to rest herself; and about\r\nthe hour of first sleep stole out of the house and down to the tower,\r\nbeside the Arno; and when, having carefully looked about her, she was\r\nsatisfied that never a soul was to be seen or heard, she took off her\r\nclothes and hid them under a bush; then, with the image in her hand, she\r\ndipped herself seven times in the river; which done, she hied her with\r\nthe image to the tower. The scholar, having at nightfall couched himself\r\nwith his servant among the willows and other trees that fringed the bank,\r\nmarked all that she did, and how, as she passed by him, the whiteness of\r\nher flesh dispelled the shades of night, and scanning attentively her\r\nbosom and every other part of her body, and finding them very fair, felt,\r\nas he bethought him what would shortly befall them, some pity of her;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, he was suddenly assailed by the solicitations\r\nof the flesh which caused that to stand which had been inert, and\r\nprompted him to sally forth of his ambush and take her by force, and have\r\nhis pleasure of her. And, what with his compassion and passion, he was\r\nlike to be worsted; but then as he bethought him who he was, and what a\r\ngrievous wrong had been done him, and for what cause, and by whom, his\r\nwrath, thus rekindled, got the better of the other affections, so that he\r\nswerved not from his resolve, but suffered her to go her way.\r\n\r\nThe lady ascended the tower, and standing with her face to the North,\r\nbegan to recite the scholar's orison, while he, having stolen into the\r\ntower but a little behind her, cautiously shifted the ladder that led up\r\nto the roof on which the lady stood, and waited to observe what she would\r\nsay and do. Seven times the lady said the orison, and then awaited the\r\nappearance of the two damsels; and so long had she to wait--not to\r\nmention that the night was a good deal cooler than she would have\r\nliked--that she saw day break; whereupon, disconcerted that it had not\r\nfallen out as the scholar had promised, she said to herself:--I misdoubt\r\nme he was minded to give me such a night as I gave him; but if such was\r\nhis intent, he is but maladroit in his revenge, for this night is not as\r\nlong by a third as his was, besides which, the cold is of another\r\nquality. And that day might not overtake her there, she began to think of\r\ndescending, but, finding that the ladder was removed, she felt as if the\r\nworld had come to nought beneath her feet, her senses reeled, and she\r\nfell in a swoon upon the floor of the roof. When she came to herself, she\r\nburst into tears and piteous lamentations, and witting now very well that\r\n'twas the doing of the scholar, she began to repent her that she had\r\nfirst offended him, and then trusted him unduly, having such good cause\r\nto reckon upon his enmity; in which frame she abode long time. Then,\r\nsearching if haply she might find some means of descent, and finding\r\nnone, she fell a weeping again, and bitterly to herself she said:--Alas\r\nfor thee, wretched woman! what will thy brothers, thy kinsmen, thy\r\nneighbours, nay, what will all Florence say of thee, when 'tis known that\r\nthou hast been found here naked? Thy honour, hitherto unsuspect, will be\r\nknown to have been but a shew, and shouldst thou seek thy defence in\r\nlying excuses, if any such may be fashioned, the accursed scholar, who\r\nknows all thy doings, will not suffer it. Ah! poor wretch! that at one\r\nand the same time hast lost thy too dearly cherished gallant and thine\r\nown honour! And therewith she was taken with such a transport of grief,\r\nthat she was like to cast herself from the tower to the ground. Then,\r\nbethinking her that if she might espy some lad making towards the tower\r\nwith his sheep, she might send him for her maid, for the sun was now\r\nrisen, she approached one of the parapets of the tower, and looked out,\r\nand so it befell that the scholar, awakening from a slumber, in which he\r\nhad lain a while at the foot of a bush, espied her, and she him.\r\nWhereupon:--\"Good-day, Madam,\" quoth he:--\"are the damsels yet come?\" The\r\nlady saw and heard him not without bursting afresh into a flood of tears,\r\nand besought him to come into the tower, that she might speak with him: a\r\nrequest which the scholar very courteously granted. The lady then threw\r\nherself prone on the floor of the roof; and, only her head being visible\r\nthrough the aperture, thus through her sobs she spoke:--\"Verily, Rinieri,\r\nif I gave thee a bad night, thou art well avenged on me, for, though it\r\nbe July, meseemed I was sore a cold last night, standing here with never\r\na thread upon me, and, besides, I have so bitterly bewept both the trick\r\nI played thee and my own folly in trusting thee, that I marvel that I\r\nhave still eyes in my head. Wherefore I implore thee, not for love of me,\r\nwhom thou hast no cause to love, but for the respect thou hast for\r\nthyself as a gentleman, that thou let that which thou hast already done\r\nsuffice thee to avenge the wrong I did thee, and bring me my clothes,\r\nthat I may be able to get me down from here, and spare to take from me\r\nthat which, however thou mightst hereafter wish, thou couldst not restore\r\nto me, to wit, my honour; whereas, if I deprived thee of that one night\r\nwith me, 'tis in my power to give thee many another night in recompense\r\nthereof, and thou hast but to choose thine own times. Let this, then,\r\nsuffice, and like a worthy gentleman be satisfied to have taken thy\r\nrevenge, and to have let me know it: put not forth thy might against a\r\nwoman: 'tis no glory to the eagle to have vanquished a dove; wherefore\r\nfor God's and thine own honour's sake have mercy on me.\"\r\n\r\nThe scholar, albeit his haughty spirit still brooded on her evil\r\nentreatment of him, yet saw her not weep and supplicate without a certain\r\ncompunction mingling with his exultation; but vengeance he had desired\r\nabove all things, to have wreaked it was indeed sweet, and albeit his\r\nhumanity prompted him to have compassion on the hapless woman, yet it\r\navailed not to subdue the fierceness of his resentment; wherefore thus he\r\nmade answer:--\"Madam Elena, had my prayers (albeit art I had none to\r\nmingle with them tears and honeyed words as thou dost with thine)\r\ninclined thee that night, when I stood perishing with cold amid the snow\r\nthat filled thy courtyard, to accord me the very least shelter, 'twere\r\nbut a light matter for me to hearken now to thine; but, if thou art now\r\nso much more careful of thy honour than thou wast wont to be, and it irks\r\nthee to tarry there naked, address thy prayers to him in whose arms it\r\nirked thee not naked to pass that night thou mindest thee of, albeit thou\r\nwist that I with hasty foot was beating time upon the snow in thy\r\ncourtyard to the accompaniment of chattering teeth: 'tis he that thou\r\nshouldst call to succour thee, to fetch thy clothes, to adjust the ladder\r\nfor thy descent; 'tis he in whom thou shouldst labour to inspire this\r\ntenderness thou now shewest for thy honour, that honour which for his\r\nsake thou hast not scrupled to jeopardize both now and on a thousand\r\nother occasions. Why, then, call'st thou not him to come to thy succour?\r\nTo whom pertains it rather than to him? Thou art his. And of whom will he\r\nhave a care, whom will he succour, if not thee? Thou askedst him that\r\nnight, when thou wast wantoning with him, whether seemed to him the\r\ngreater, my folly or the love thou didst bear him: call him now, foolish\r\nwoman, and see if the love thou bearest him, and thy wit and his, may\r\navail to deliver thee from my folly. 'Tis now no longer in thy power to\r\nshew me courtesy of that which I no more desire, nor yet to refuse it,\r\ndid I desire it. Reserve thy nights for thy lover, if so be thou go hence\r\nalive. Be they all thine and his. One of them was more than I cared for;\r\n'tis enough for me to have been flouted once. Ay, and by thy cunning of\r\nspeech thou strivest might and main to conciliate my good-will, calling\r\nme worthy gentleman, by which insinuation thou wouldst fain induce me\r\nmagnanimously to desist from further chastisement of thy baseness. But\r\nthy cajoleries shall not now cloud the eyes of my mind, as did once thy\r\nfalse promises. I know myself, and better now for thy one night's\r\ninstruction than for all the time I spent at Paris. But, granted that I\r\nwere disposed to be magnanimous, thou art not of those to whom 'tis meet\r\nto shew magnanimity. A wild beast such as thou, having merited vengeance,\r\ncan claim no relief from suffering save death, though in the case of a\r\nhuman being 'twould suffice to temper vengeance with mercy, as thou\r\nsaidst. Wherefore I, albeit no eagle, witting thee to be no dove, but a\r\nvenomous serpent, mankind's most ancient enemy, am minded, bating no jot\r\nof malice or of might, to harry thee to the bitter end: natheless this\r\nwhich I do is not properly to be called vengeance but rather just\r\nretribution; seeing that vengeance should be in excess of the offence,\r\nand this my chastisement of thee will fall short of it; for, were I\r\nminded to be avenged on thee, considering what account thou madest of my\r\nheart and soul, 'twould not suffice me to take thy life, no, nor the\r\nlives of a hundred others such as thee; for I should but slay a vile and\r\nbase and wicked woman. And what the Devil art thou more than any other\r\npitiful baggage, that I should spare thy little store of beauty, which a\r\nfew years will ruin, covering thy face with wrinkles? And yet 'twas not\r\nfor want of will that thou didst fail to do to death a worthy gentleman,\r\nas thou but now didst call me, of whom in a single day of his life the\r\nworld may well have more profit than of a hundred thousand like thee\r\nwhile the world shall last. Wherefore by this rude discipline I will\r\nteach thee what it is to flout men of spirit, and more especially what it\r\nis to flout scholars, that if thou escape with thy life thou mayst have\r\ngood cause ever hereafter to shun such folly. But if thou art so fain to\r\nmake the descent, why cast not thyself down, whereby, God helping, thou\r\nwouldst at once break thy neck, be quit of the torment thou endurest, and\r\nmake me the happiest man alive? I have no more to say to thee. 'Twas my\r\nart and craft thus caused thee climb; be it thine to find the way down:\r\nthou hadst cunning enough, when thou wast minded to flout me.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the scholar thus spoke, the hapless lady wept incessantly, and\r\nbefore he had done, to aggravate her misery, the sun was high in the\r\nheaven. However, when he was silent, thus she made answer:--\"Ah! ruthless\r\nman, if that accursed night has so rankled with thee, and thou deemest my\r\nfault so grave that neither my youth and beauty, nor my bitter tears, nor\r\nyet my humble supplications may move thee to pity, let this at least move\r\nthee, and abate somewhat of thy remorseless severity, that 'twas my act\r\nalone, in that of late I trusted thee, and discovered to thee all my\r\nsecret, that did open the way to compass thy end, and make me cognizant\r\nof my guilt, seeing that, had I not confided in thee, on no wise mightst\r\nthou have been avenged on me; which thou wouldst seem so ardently to have\r\ndesired. Turn thee, then, turn thee, I pray thee, from thy wrath, and\r\npardon me. So thou wilt pardon me, and get me down hence, right gladly\r\nwill I give up for ever my faithless gallant, and thou shalt be my sole\r\nlover and lord, albeit thou sayst hard things of my beauty, slight and\r\nshortlived as thou wouldst have it to be, which, however it may compare\r\nwith others, is, I wot, to be prized, if for no other reason, yet for\r\nthis, that 'tis the admiration and solace and delight of young men, and\r\nthou art not yet old. And albeit I have been harshly treated by thee, yet\r\nbelieve I cannot that thou wouldst have me do myself so shamefully to\r\ndeath as to cast me down, like some abandoned wretch, before thine eyes,\r\nin which, unless thou wast then, as thou hast since shewn thyself, a\r\nliar, I found such favour. Ah! have pity on me for God's and mercy's\r\nsake! The sun waxes exceeding hot, and having suffered not a little by\r\nthe cold of last night, I now begin to be sorely afflicted by the heat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" rejoined the scholar, who held her in parley with no small\r\ndelight, \"'twas not for any love that thou didst bear me that thou\r\ntrustedst me, but that thou mightst recover that which thou hadst lost,\r\nfor which cause thou meritest but the greater punishment; and foolish\r\nindeed art thou if thou supposest that such was the sole means available\r\nfor my revenge. I had a thousand others, and, while I feigned to love\r\nthee, I had laid a thousand gins for thy feet, into one or other of which\r\nin no long time, though this had not occurred, thou must needs have\r\nfallen, and that too to thy more grievous suffering and shame; nor was it\r\nto spare thee, but that I might be the sooner rejoiced by thy\r\ndiscomfiture that I took my present course. And though all other means\r\nhad failed me, I had still the pen, with which I would have written of\r\nthee such matters and in such a sort, that when thou wist them, as thou\r\nshouldst have done, thou wouldst have regretted a thousand times that\r\nthou hadst ever been born. The might of the pen is greater far than they\r\nsuppose, who have not proved it by experience. By God I swear, so may He,\r\nwho has prospered me thus far in this my revenge, prosper me to the end!\r\nthat I would have written of thee things that would have so shamed thee\r\nin thine own--not to speak of others'--sight that thou hadst put out\r\nthine eyes that thou mightst no more see thyself; wherefore chide not the\r\nsea, for that it has sent forth a tiny rivulet. For thy love, or whether\r\nthou be mine or no, nought care I. Be thou still his, whose thou hast\r\nbeen, if thou canst. Hate him as I once did, I now love him, by reason of\r\nhis present entreatment of thee. Ye go getting you enamoured, ye women,\r\nand nought will satisfy you but young gallants, because ye mark that\r\ntheir flesh is ruddier, and their beards are blacker, than other folk's,\r\nand that they carry themselves well, and foot it featly in the dance, and\r\njoust; but those that are now more mature were even as they, and possess\r\na knowledge which they have yet to acquire. And therewithal ye deem that\r\nthey ride better, and cover more miles in a day, than men of riper age.\r\nNow that they dust the pelisse with more vigour I certainly allow, but\r\ntheir seniors, being more experienced, know better the places where the\r\nfleas lurk; and spare and dainty diet is preferable to abundance without\r\nsavour: moreover hard trotting will gall and jade even the youngest,\r\nwhereas an easy pace, though it bring one somewhat later to the inn, at\r\nany rate brings one thither fresh. Ye discern not, witless creatures that\r\nye are, how much of evil this little shew of bravery serves to hide. Your\r\nyoung gallant is never content with one woman, but lusts after as many as\r\nhe sets eyes on; nor is there any but he deems himself worthy of her:\r\nwherefore 'tis not possible that their love should be lasting, as thou\r\nhast but now proved and mayst only too truly witness. Moreover to be\r\nworshipped, to be caressed by their ladies they deem but their due; nor\r\nis there aught whereon they plume and boast them so proudly as their\r\nconquests: which impertinence has caused not a few women to surrender to\r\nthe friars, who keep their own counsel. Peradventure thou wilt say that\r\nnever a soul save thy maid, and I wist aught of thy loves; but, if so,\r\nthou hast been misinformed, and if thou so believest, thou dost\r\nmisbelieve. Scarce aught else is talked of either in his quarter or in\r\nthine; but most often 'tis those most concerned whose ears such matters\r\nreach last. Moreover, they rob you, these young gallants, whereas the\r\nothers make you presents. So, then, having made a bad choice, be thou\r\nstill his to whom thou hast given thyself, and leave me, whom thou didst\r\nflout, to another, for I have found a lady of much greater charms than\r\nthine, and that has understood me better than thou didst. And that thou\r\nmayst get thee to the other world better certified of the desire of my\r\neyes than thou wouldst seem to be here by my words, delay no more, but\r\ncast thyself down, whereby thy soul, taken forthwith, as I doubt not she\r\nwill be, into the embrace of the Devil, may see whether thy headlong fall\r\nafflicts mine eyes, or no. But, for that I doubt thou meanest not thus to\r\ngladden me, I bid thee, if thou findest the sun begin to scorch thee,\r\nremember the cold thou didst cause me to endure, wherewith, by admixture,\r\nthou mayst readily temper the sun's heat.\"\r\n\r\nThe hapless lady, seeing that the scholar's words were ever to the same\r\nruthless effect, burst afresh into tears, and said:--\"Lo, now, since\r\nnought that pertains to me may move thee, be thou at least moved by the\r\nlove thou bearest this lady of whom thou speakest, who, thou sayst, is\r\nwiser than I, and loves thee, and for love of her pardon me, and fetch me\r\nmy clothes, that I may resume them, and get me down hence.\" Whereat the\r\nscholar fell a laughing, and seeing that 'twas not a little past tierce,\r\nmade answer:--\"Lo, now, I know not how to deny thee, adjuring me as thou\r\ndost by such a lady: tell me, then, where thy clothes are, and I will go\r\nfetch them, and bring thee down.\" The lady, believing him, was somewhat\r\ncomforted, and told him where she had laid her clothes. The scholar then\r\nquitted the tower, bidding his servant on no account to stir from his\r\npost, but to keep close by, and, as best he might, bar the tower against\r\nall comers until his return: which said, he betook him to the house of\r\nhis friend, where he breakfasted much at his ease, and thereafter went to\r\nsleep. Left alone upon the tower, the lady, somewhat cheered by her fond\r\nhope, but still exceeding sorrowful, drew nigh to a part of the wall\r\nwhere there was a little shade, and there sate down to wait. And now lost\r\nin most melancholy brooding, now dissolved in tears, now plunged in\r\ndespair of ever seeing the scholar return with her clothes, but never\r\nmore than a brief while in any one mood, spent with grief and the night's\r\nvigil, she by and by fell asleep. The sun was now in the zenith, and\r\nsmote with extreme fervour full and unmitigated upon her tender and\r\ndelicate frame, and upon her bare head, insomuch that his rays did not\r\nonly scorch but bit by bit excoriate every part of her flesh that was\r\nexposed to them, and so shrewdly burn her that, albeit she was in a deep\r\nsleep, the pain awoke her. And as by reason thereof she writhed a little,\r\nshe felt the scorched skin part in sunder and shed itself, as will happen\r\nwhen one tugs at a parchment that has been singed by the fire, while her\r\nhead ached so sore that it seemed like to split, and no wonder. Nor might\r\nshe find place either to lie or to stand on the floor of the roof, but\r\never went to and fro, weeping. Besides which there stirred not the least\r\nbreath of wind, and flies and gadflies did swarm in prodigious quantity,\r\nwhich, settling upon her excoriate flesh, stung her so shrewdly that\r\n'twas as if she received so many stabs with a javelin, and she was ever\r\nrestlessly feeling her sores with her hands, and cursing herself, her\r\nlife, her lover, and the scholar.\r\n\r\nThus by the exorbitant heat of the sun, by the flies and gadflies,\r\nharassed, goaded, and lacerated, tormented also by hunger, and yet more\r\nby thirst, and, thereto by a thousand distressful thoughts, she panted\r\nherself erect on her feet, and looked about her, if haply she might see\r\nor hear any one, with intent, come what might, to call to him and crave\r\nhis succour. But even this hostile Fortune had disallowed her. The\r\nhusbandmen were all gone from the fields by reason of the heat, and\r\nindeed there had come none to work that day in the neighbourhood of the\r\ntower, for that all were employed in threshing their corn beside their\r\ncottages: wherefore she heard but the cicalas, while Arno, tantalizing\r\nher with the sight of his waters, increased rather than diminished her\r\nthirst. Ay, and in like manner, wherever she espied a copse, or a patch\r\nof shade, or a house, 'twas a torment to her, for the longing she had for\r\nit. What more is to be said of this hapless woman? Only this: that what\r\nwith the heat of the sun above and the floor beneath her, and the\r\nscarification of her flesh in every part by the flies and gadflies, that\r\nflesh, which in the night had dispelled the gloom by its whiteness, was\r\nnow become red as madder, and so besprent with clots of blood, that whoso\r\nhad seen her would have deemed her the most hideous object in the world.\r\n\r\nThus resourceless and hopeless, she passed the long hours, expecting\r\ndeath rather than aught else, until half none was come and gone; when,\r\nhis siesta ended, the scholar bethought him of his lady, and being minded\r\nto see how she fared, hied him back to the tower, and sent his servant\r\naway to break his fast. As soon as the lady espied him, she came, spent\r\nand crushed by her sore affliction, to the aperture, and thus addressed\r\nhim:--\"Rinieri, the cup of thy vengeance is full to overflowing: for if I\r\ngave thee a night of freezing in my courtyard, thou hast given me upon\r\nthis tower a day of scorching, nay, of burning, and therewithal of\r\nperishing of hunger and thirst: wherefore by God I entreat thee to come\r\nup hither, and as my heart fails me to take my life, take it thou, for\r\n'tis death I desire of all things, such and so grievous is my suffering.\r\nBut if this grace thou wilt not grant, at least bring me a cup of water\r\nwherewith to lave my mouth, for which my tears do not suffice, so parched\r\nand torrid is it within.\" Well wist the scholar by her voice how spent\r\nshe was; he also saw a part of her body burned through and through by the\r\nsun; whereby, and by reason of the lowliness of her entreaties, he felt\r\nsome little pity for her; but all the same he made answer:--\"Nay, wicked\r\nwoman, 'tis not by my hands thou shalt die; thou canst die by thine own\r\nwhenever thou art so minded; and to temper thy heat thou shalt have just\r\nas much water from me as I had fire from thee to mitigate my cold. I only\r\nregret that for the cure of my chill the physicians were fain to use\r\nfoul-smelling muck, whereas thy burns can be treated with fragrant\r\nrose-water; and that, whereas I was like to lose my muscles and the use\r\nof my limbs, thou, for all thy excoriation by the heat, wilt yet be fair\r\nagain, like a snake that has sloughed off the old skin.\" \"Alas! woe's\r\nme!\" replied the lady, \"for charms acquired at such a cost, God grant\r\nthem to those that hate me. But thou, most fell of all wild beasts, how\r\nhast thou borne thus to torture me? What more had I to expect of thee or\r\nany other, had I done all thy kith and kin to death with direst torments?\r\nVerily, I know not what more cruel suffering thou couldst have inflicted\r\non a traitor that had put a whole city to the slaughter than this which\r\nthou hast allotted to me, to be thus roasted, and devoured of the flies,\r\nand therewithal to refuse me even a cup of water, though the very\r\nmurderers condemned to death by the law, as they go to execution, not\r\nseldom are allowed wine to drink, so they but ask it. Lo now, I see that\r\nthou art inexorable in thy ruthlessness, and on no wise to be moved by my\r\nsuffering: wherefore with resignation I will compose me to await death,\r\nthat God may have mercy on my soul. And may this that thou doest escape\r\nnot the searching glance of His just eyes.\" Which said, she dragged\r\nherself, sore suffering, toward the middle of the floor, despairing of\r\never escaping from her fiery torment, besides which, not once only, but a\r\nthousand times she thought to choke for thirst, and ever she wept\r\nbitterly and bewailed her evil fate. But at length the day wore to\r\nvespers, and the scholar, being sated with his revenge, caused his\r\nservant to take her clothes and wrap them in his cloak, and hied him with\r\nthe servant to the hapless lady's house, where, finding her maid sitting\r\ndisconsolate and woebegone and resourceless at the door:--\"Good woman,\"\r\nquoth he, \"what has befallen thy mistress?\" Whereto:--\"Sir, I know not,\"\r\nreplied the maid. \"I looked to find her this morning abed, for methought\r\nshe went to bed last night, but neither there nor anywhere else could I\r\nfind her, nor know I what is become of her; wherefore exceeding great is\r\nmy distress; but have you, Sir, nought to say of the matter?\" \"Only\r\nthis,\" returned the scholar, \"that I would I had had thee with her there\r\nwhere I have had her, that I might have requited thee of thy offence,\r\neven as I have requited her of hers. But be assured that thou shalt not\r\nescape my hands, until thou hast from me such wage of thy labour that\r\nthou shalt never flout man more, but thou shalt mind thee of me.\" Then,\r\nturning to his servant, he said:--\"Give her these clothes, and tell her\r\nthat she may go bring her mistress away, if she will.\" The servant did\r\nhis bidding; and the maid, what with the message and her recognition of\r\nthe clothes, was mightily afraid, lest they had slain the lady, and\r\nscarce suppressing a shriek, took the clothes, and, bursting into tears,\r\nset off, as soon as the scholar was gone, at a run for the tower.\r\n\r\nNow one of the lady's husbandmen had had the misfortune to lose two of\r\nhis hogs that day, and, seeking them, came to the tower not long after\r\nthe scholar had gone thence, and peering about in all quarters, if haply\r\nhe might have sight of his hogs, heard the woeful lamentation that the\r\nhapless lady made, and got him up into the tower, and called out as loud\r\nas he might:--\"Who wails up there?\" The lady recognized her husbandman's\r\nvoice, and called him by name, saying:--\"Prithee, go fetch my maid, and\r\ncause her come up hither to me.\" The husbandman, knowing her by her\r\nvoice, replied:--\"Alas! Madam, who set you there? Your maid has been\r\nseeking you all day long: but who would ever have supposed that you were\r\nthere?\" Whereupon he took the props of the ladder, and set them in\r\nposition, and proceeded to secure the rounds to them with withies. Thus\r\nengaged he was found by the maid, who, as she entered the tower, beat her\r\nface and breast, and unable longer to keep silence, cried out:--\"Alas,\r\nsweet my lady, where are you?\" Whereto the lady made answer as loud as\r\nshe might:--\"O my sister, here above am I, weep not, but fetch me my\r\nclothes forthwith.\" Well-nigh restored to heart, to hear her mistress's\r\nvoice, the maid, assisted by the husbandman, ascended the ladder, which\r\nhe had now all but set in order, and gaining the roof, and seeing her\r\nlady lie there naked, spent and fordone, and liker to a half-burned stump\r\nthan to a human being, she planted her nails in her face and fell a\r\nweeping over her, as if she were a corpse. However, the lady bade her for\r\nGod's sake be silent, and help her to dress, and having learned from her\r\nthat none knew where she had been, save those that had brought her her\r\nclothes and the husbandman that was there present, was somewhat consoled,\r\nand besought her for God's sake to say nought of the matter to any. Thus\r\nlong time they conversed, and then the husbandman took the lady on his\r\nshoulders, for walk she could not, and bore her safely out of the tower.\r\nThe unfortunate maid, following after with somewhat less caution,\r\nslipped, and falling from the ladder to the ground, broke her thigh, and\r\nroared for pain like any lion. So the husbandman set the lady down upon a\r\ngrassy mead, while he went to see what had befallen the maid, whom,\r\nfinding her thigh broken, he brought, and laid beside the lady: who,\r\nseeing her woes completed by this last misfortune, and that she of whom,\r\nmost of all, she had expected succour, was lamed of a thigh, was\r\ndistressed beyond measure, and wept again so piteously that not only was\r\nthe husbandman powerless to comfort her, but was himself fain to weep.\r\nHowever, as the sun was now low, that they might not be there surprised\r\nby night, he, with the disconsolate lady's approval, hied him home, and\r\ncalled to his aid two of his brothers and his wife, who returned with\r\nhim, bearing a plank, whereon they laid the maid, and so they carried her\r\nto the lady's house. There, by dint of cold water and words of cheer,\r\nthey restored some heart to the lady, whom the husbandman then took upon\r\nhis shoulders, and bore to her chamber. The husbandman's wife fed her\r\nwith sops of bread, and then undressed her, and put her to bed. They also\r\nprovided the means to carry her and the maid to Florence; and so 'twas\r\ndone. There the lady, who was very fertile in artifices, invented an\r\nentirely fictitious story of what had happened as well in regard of her\r\nmaid as of herself, whereby she persuaded both her brothers and her\r\nsisters and every one else, that 'twas all due to the enchantments of\r\nevil spirits. The physicians lost no time, and, albeit the lady's\r\nsuffering and mortification were extreme, for she left more than one skin\r\nsticking to the sheets, they cured her of a high fever, and certain\r\nattendant maladies; as also the maid of her fractured thigh. The end of\r\nall which was that the lady forgot her lover, and having learned\r\ndiscretion, was thenceforth careful neither to love nor to flout; and the\r\nscholar, learning that the maid had broken her thigh, deemed his\r\nvengeance complete, and was satisfied to say never a word more of the\r\naffair. Such then were the consequences of her flouts to this foolish\r\nyoung woman, who deemed that she might trifle with a scholar with the\r\nlike impunity as with others, not duly understanding that they--I say not\r\nall, but the more part--know where the Devil keeps his tail.(1)\r\nWherefore, my ladies, have a care how you flout men, and more especially\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\n(1) I.e. are a match for the Devil himself in cunning.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VIII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nTwo men keep with one another: the one lies with the other's wife: the\r\nother, being ware thereof, manages with the aid of his wife to have the\r\none locked in a chest, upon which he then lies with the wife of him that\r\nis locked therein.\r\n--\r\n\r\nGrievous and distressful was it to the ladies to hear how it fared with\r\nElena; but as they accounted the retribution in a measure righteous, they\r\nwere satisfied to expend upon her but a moderate degree of compassion,\r\nalbeit they censured the scholar as severe, intemperately relentless, and\r\nindeed ruthless, in his vengeance. However, Pampinea having brought the\r\nstory to a close, the queen bade Fiammetta follow suit; and prompt to\r\nobey, Fiammetta thus spoke:--Debonair my ladies, as, methinks, your\r\nfeelings must have been somewhat harrowed by the severity of the\r\nresentful scholar, I deem it meet to soothe your vexed spirits with\r\nsomething of a more cheerful order. Wherefore I am minded to tell you a\r\nlittle story of a young man who bore an affront in a milder temper, and\r\navenged himself with more moderation. Whereby you may understand that one\r\nshould be satisfied if the ass and the wall are quits, nor by indulging a\r\nvindictive spirit to excess turn the requital of a wrong into an occasion\r\nof wrong-doing. You are to know, then, that at Siena, as I have heard\r\ntell, there dwelt two young men of good substance, and, for plebeians, of\r\ngood family, the one Spinelloccio Tanena, the other Zeppa di Mino, by\r\nname; who, their houses being contiguous in the Camollia,(1) kept ever\r\ntogether, and, by what appeared, loved each other as brothers, or even\r\nmore so, and had each a very fine woman to wife. Now it so befell that\r\nSpinelloccio, being much in Zeppa's house, as well when Zeppa was not, as\r\nwhen he was there, grew so familiar with Zeppa's wife, that he sometimes\r\nlay with her; and on this wise they continued to forgather a great while\r\nbefore any one was ware of it. However, one of these days Zeppa being at\r\nhome, though the lady wist it not, Spinelloccio came in quest of him;\r\nand, the lady sending word that he was not at home, he forthwith went\r\nupstairs and found the lady in the saloon, and seeing none else there,\r\nkissed her, as did she him.\r\n\r\nZeppa saw all that passed, but said nothing and kept close, being minded\r\nto see how the game would end, and soon saw his wife and Spinelloccio,\r\nstill in one another's arms, hie them to her chamber and lock themselves\r\nin: whereat he was mightily incensed. But, witting that to make a noise,\r\nor do aught else overt, would not lessen but rather increase his\r\ndishonour, he cast about how he might be avenged on such wise that,\r\nwithout the affair getting wind, he might content his soul; and having,\r\nafter long pondering, hit, as he thought, upon the expedient, he budged\r\nnot from his retreat, until Spinelloccio had parted from the lady.\r\nWhereupon he hied him into the chamber, and there finding the lady with\r\nher head-gear, which Spinelloccio in toying with her had disarranged,\r\nscarce yet readjusted:--\"Madam, what dost thou?\" quoth he.\r\nWhereto:--\"Why, dost not see?\" returned the lady. \"Troth do I,\" rejoined\r\nhe, \"and somewhat else have I seen that I would I had not.\" And so he\r\nquestioned her of what had passed, and she, being mightily afraid, did\r\nafter long parley confess that which she might not plausibly deny, to\r\nwit, her intimacy with Spinelloccio, and fell a beseeching him with tears\r\nto pardon her. \"Lo, now, wife,\" quoth Zeppa, \"thou hast done wrong, and,\r\nso thou wouldst have me pardon thee, have a care to do exactly as I shall\r\nbid thee; to wit, on this wise: thou must tell Spinelloccio, to find some\r\noccasion to part from me to-morrow morning about tierce, and come hither\r\nto thee; and while he is here I will come back, and when thou hearest me\r\ncoming, thou wilt get him into this chest, and lock him in there; which\r\nwhen thou hast done, I will tell thee what else thou hast to do, which\r\nthou mayst do without the least misgiving, for I promise thee I will do\r\nhim no harm.\" The lady, to content him, promised to do as he bade, and\r\nshe kept her word.\r\n\r\nThe morrow came, and Zeppa and Spinelloccio being together about tierce,\r\nSpinelloccio, having promised the lady to come to see her at that hour,\r\nsaid to Zeppa:--\"I must go breakfast with a friend, whom I had lief not\r\nkeep in waiting; therefore, adieu!\" \"Nay, but,\" quoth Zeppa, \"'tis not\r\nyet breakfast-time.\" \"No matter,\" returned Spinelloccio, \"I have business\r\non which I must speak with him; so I must be in good time.\" Whereupon\r\nSpinelloccio took his leave of Zeppa, and having reached Zeppa's house by\r\na slightly circuitous route, and finding his wife there, was taken by her\r\ninto the chamber, where they had not been long together when Zeppa\r\nreturned. Hearing him come, the lady, feigning no small alarm, bundled\r\nSpinelloccio into the chest, as her husband had bidden her, and having\r\nlocked him in, left him there. As Zeppa came upstairs:--\"Wife,\" quoth he,\r\n\"is it breakfast time?\" \"Ay, husband, 'tis so,\" replied the lady.\r\nWhereupon:--\"Spinelloccio is gone to breakfast with a friend to-day,\"\r\nquoth Zeppa, \"leaving his wife at home: get thee to the window, and call\r\nher, and bid her come and breakfast with us.\" The lady, whose fear for\r\nherself made her mighty obedient, did as her husband bade her; and after\r\nmuch pressing Spinelloccio's wife came to breakfast with them, though she\r\nwas given to understand that her husband would not be of the company. So,\r\nshe being come, Zeppa received her most affectionately, and taking her\r\nfamiliarly by the hand, bade his wife, in an undertone, get her to the\r\nkitchen; he then led Spinelloccio's wife into the chamber, and locked the\r\ndoor. Hearing the key turn in the lock:--\"Alas!\" quoth the lady, \"what\r\nmeans this, Zeppa? Is't for this you have brought me here? Is this the\r\nlove you bear Spinelloccio? Is this your loyalty to him as your friend\r\nand comrade?\" By the time she had done speaking, Zeppa, still keeping\r\nfast hold of her, was beside the chest, in which her husband was locked.\r\nWherefore:--\"Madam,\" quoth he, \"spare me thy reproaches, until thou hast\r\nheard what I have to say to thee. I have loved, I yet love, Spinelloccio\r\nas a brother; and yesterday, though he knew it not, I discovered that the\r\ntrust I reposed in him has for its guerdon that he lies with my wife, as\r\nwith thee. Now, for that I love him, I purpose not to be avenged upon him\r\nsave in the sort in which he offended. He has had my wife, and I intend\r\nto have thee. So thou wilt not grant me what I crave of thee, be sure I\r\nshall not fail to take it; and having no mind to let this affront pass\r\nunavenged, will make such play with him that neither thou nor he shall\r\never be happy again.\" The lady hearkening, and by dint of his repeated\r\nasseverations coming at length to believe him:--\"Zeppa mine,\" quoth she,\r\n\"as this thy vengeance is to light upon me, well content am I; so only\r\nthou let not this which we are to do embroil me with thy wife, with whom,\r\nnotwithstanding the evil turn she has done me, I am minded to remain at\r\npeace.\" \"Have no fear on that score,\" replied Zeppa; \"nay, I will give\r\nthee into the bargain a jewel so rare and fair that thou hast not the\r\nlike.\" Which said, he took her in his arms and fell a kissing her, and\r\nhaving laid her on the chest, in which her husband was safe under lock\r\nand key, did there disport himself with her to his heart's content, as\r\nshe with him.\r\n\r\nSpinelloccio in the chest heard all that Zeppa had said, and how he was\r\nanswered by the lady, and the Trevisan dance that afterwards went on over\r\nhis head; whereat his mortification was such that for a great while he\r\nscarce hoped to live through it; and, but for the fear he had of Zeppa,\r\nhe would have given his wife a sound rating, close prisoner though he\r\nwas. But, as he bethought him that 'twas he that had given the first\r\naffront, and that Zeppa had good cause for acting as he did, and that he\r\nhad dealt with him considerately and as a good fellow should, he resolved\r\nthat if it were agreeable to Zeppa, they should be faster friends than\r\never before. However, Zeppa, having had his pleasure with the lady, got\r\ndown from the chest, and being reminded by the lady of his promise of the\r\njewel, opened the door of the chamber and brought his wife in. Quoth she\r\nwith a laugh:--\"Madam, you have given me tit for tat,\" and never a word\r\nmore. Whereupon:--\"Open the chest,\" quoth Zeppa; and she obeying, he\r\nshewed the lady her Spinelloccio lying therein. 'Twould be hard to say\r\nwhether of the twain was the more shame-stricken, Spinelloccio to be\r\nconfronted with Zeppa, knowing that Zeppa wist what he had done, or the\r\nlady to meet her husband's eyes, knowing that he had heard what went on\r\nabove his head. \"Lo, here is the jewel I give thee,\" quoth Zeppa to her,\r\npointing to Spinelloccio, who, as he came forth of the chest, blurted\r\nout:--\"Zeppa, we are quits, and so 'twere best, as thou saidst a while\r\nago to my wife, that we still be friends as we were wont, and as we had\r\nnought separate, save our wives, that henceforth we have them also in\r\ncommon.\" \"Content,\" quoth Zeppa; and so in perfect peace and accord they\r\nall four breakfasted together. And thenceforth each of the ladies had two\r\nhusbands, and each of the husbands two wives; nor was there ever the\r\nleast dispute or contention between them on that score.\r\n\r\n(1) A suburb of Siena.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IX.\r\n\r\n--\r\nBruno and Buffalmacco prevail upon Master Simone, a physician, to betake\r\nhim by night to a certain place, there to be enrolled in a company that\r\ngo the course. Buffalmacco throws him into a foul ditch, and there they\r\nleave him.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies had made merry a while over the partnership in wives\r\nestablished by the two Sienese, the queen, who now, unless she were\r\nminded to infringe Dioneo's privilege, alone remained to tell, began on\r\nthis wise:--Fairly earned indeed, loving ladies, was the flout that\r\nSpinelloccio got from Zeppa. Wherefore my judgment jumps with that which\r\nPampinea expressed a while ago, to wit, that he is not severely to be\r\ncensured who bestows a flout on one that provokes it or deserves it; and\r\nas Spinelloccio deserved it, so 'tis my purpose to tell you of one that\r\nprovoked it, for I deem that those from whom he received it, were rather\r\nto be commended than condemned. The man that got it was a physician, who,\r\nalbeit he was but a blockhead, returned from Bologna to Florence in\r\nmantle and hood of vair.\r\n\r\n'Tis matter of daily experience that our citizens come back to us from\r\nBologna, this man a judge, that a physician, and the other a notary,\r\nflaunting it in ample flowing robes, and adorned with the scarlet and the\r\nvair and other array most goodly to see; and how far their doings\r\ncorrespond with this fair seeming, is also matter of daily experience.\r\nAmong whom 'tis not long since Master Simone da Villa, one whose\r\npatrimony was more ample than his knowledge, came back wearing the\r\nscarlet and a broad stripe(1) on the shoulder, and a doctor, as he called\r\nhimself, and took a house in the street that we now call Via del\r\nCocomero. Now this Master Simone, being thus, as we said, come back, had\r\nthis among other singular habits, that he could never see a soul pass\r\nalong the street, but he must needs ask any that was by, who that man\r\nwas; and he was as observant of all the doings of men, and as sedulous to\r\nstore his memory with such matters, as if they were to serve him to\r\ncompound the drugs that he was to give his patients. Now, of all that he\r\nsaw, those that he eyed most observantly were two painters, of whom here\r\nto-day mention has twice been made, Bruno, to wit, and Buffalmacco, who\r\nwere ever together, and were his neighbours. And as it struck him that\r\nthey daffed the world aside and lived more lightheartedly than any others\r\nthat he knew, as indeed they did, he enquired of not a few folk as to\r\ntheir rank. And learning on all hands that they were poor men and\r\npainters, he could not conceive it possible that they should live thus\r\ncontentedly in poverty, but made his mind up that, being, as he was\r\ninformed, clever fellows, they must have some secret source from which\r\nthey drew immense gains; for which reason he grew all agog to get on\r\nfriendly terms with them, or any rate with one of them, and did succeed\r\nin making friends with Bruno.\r\n\r\nBruno, who had not needed to be much with him in order to discover that\r\nthis physician was but a dolt, had never such a jolly time in palming off\r\nhis strange stories upon him, while the physician, on his part, was\r\nmarvellously delighted with Bruno; to whom, having bidden him to\r\nbreakfast, and thinking that for that reason he might talk familiarly\r\nwith him, he expressed the amazement with which he regarded both him and\r\nBuffalmacco, for that, being but poor men, they lived so lightheartedly,\r\nand asked him to tell him how they managed. At which fresh proof of the\r\ndoctor's simplicity and fatuity Bruno was inclined to laugh; but,\r\nbethinking him that 'twere best to answer him according to his folly, he\r\nsaid:--\"Master, there are not many persons to whom I would disclose our\r\nmanner of life, but, as you are my friend, and I know you will not let it\r\ngo further, I do not mind telling you. The fact is that my comrade and I\r\nlive not only as lightheartedly and jovially as you see, but much more\r\nso; and yet neither our art, nor any property that we possess, yields us\r\nenough to keep us in water: not that I would have you suppose that we go\r\na thieving: no, 'tis that we go the course, and thereby without the least\r\nharm done to a soul we get all that we need, nay, all that we desire; and\r\nthus it is that we live so lightheartedly as you see.\" Which explanation\r\nthe doctor believing none the less readily that he knew not what it\r\nmeant, was lost in wonder, and forthwith burned with a most vehement\r\ndesire to know what going the course might be, and was instant with Bruno\r\nto expound it, assuring him that he would never tell a soul. \"Alas!\r\nMaster,\" said Bruno, \"what is this you ask of me? 'Tis a mighty great\r\nsecret you would have me impart to you: 'twould be enough to undo me, to\r\nsend me packing out of the world, nay, into the very jaws of Lucifer of\r\nSan Gallo,(2) if it came to be known. But such is the respect in which I\r\nhold your quiditative pumpionship of Legnaia, and the trust I repose in\r\nyou, that I am not able to deny you aught you ask of me; and so I will\r\ntell it you, on condition that you swear by the cross at Montesone that\r\nyou will keep your promise, and never repeat it to a soul.\"\r\n\r\nThe Master gave the required assurance. Whereupon:--\"You are then to\r\nknow,\" quoth Bruno, \"sweet my Master, that 'tis not long since there was\r\nin this city a great master in necromancy, hight Michael Scott, for that\r\nhe was of Scotland, and great indeed was the honour in which he was held\r\nby not a few gentlemen, most of whom are now dead; and when the time came\r\nthat he must needs depart from Florence, he at their instant entreaty\r\nleft behind him two pupils, adepts both, whom he bade hold themselves\r\never ready to pleasure those gentlemen who had done him honour. And very\r\nhandsomely they did serve the said gentlemen in certain of their love\r\naffairs and other little matters; and finding the city and the manners of\r\nthe citizens agreeable to them, they made up their minds to stay here\r\nalways, and grew friendly and very intimate with some of the citizens,\r\nmaking no distinction between gentle and simple, rich or poor, so only\r\nthey were such as were conformable to their ways. And to gratify these\r\ntheir friends they formed a company of perhaps twenty-five men, to meet\r\ntogether at least twice a month in a place appointed by them; where, when\r\nthey are met, each utters his desire, and forthwith that same night they\r\naccomplish it. Now Buffalmacco and I, being extraordinarily great and\r\nclose friends with these two adepts, were by them enrolled in this\r\ncompany, and are still members of it. And I assure you that, as often as\r\nwe are assembled together, the adornments of the saloon in which we eat\r\nare a marvel to see, ay, and the tables laid as for kings, and the\r\nmultitudes of stately and handsome servants, as well women as men, at the\r\nbeck and call of every member of the company, and the basins, and the\r\newers, the flasks and the cups, and all else that is there for our\r\nservice in eating and drinking, of nought but gold and silver, and\r\ntherewithal the abundance and variety of the viands, suited to the taste\r\nof each, that are set before us, each in due course, these too be\r\nmarvels. 'Twere vain for me to seek to describe to you the sweet concord\r\nthat is there of innumerable instruments of music, and the tuneful songs\r\nthat salute our ears; nor might I hope to tell you how much wax is burned\r\nat these banquets, or compute the quantity of the comfits that are eaten,\r\nor the value of the wines that are drunk. Nor, my pumpkin o' wit, would I\r\nhave you suppose that, when we are there, we wear our common clothes,\r\nsuch as you now see me wear; nay, there is none there so humble but he\r\nshews as an emperor, so sumptuous are our garments, so splendid our\r\ntrappings. But among all the delights of the place none may compare with\r\nthe fair ladies, who, so one do but wish, are brought thither from every\r\npart of the world. Why, you might see there My Lady of the Barbanichs,\r\nthe Queen of the Basques, the Consort of the Soldan, the Empress of\r\nOsbech, the Ciancianfera of Nornieca, the Semistante of Berlinzone, and\r\nthe Scalpedra of Narsia. But why seek to enumerate them all? They include\r\nall the queens in the world, ay, even to the Schinchimurra of Prester\r\nJohn, who has the horns sprouting out of her nether end: so there's for\r\nyou. Now when these ladies have done with the wine and the comfits, they\r\ntread a measure or two, each with the man at whose behest she is come,\r\nand then all go with their gallants to their chambers. And know that each\r\nof these chambers shews as a very Paradise, so fair is it, ay, and no\r\nless fragrant than the cases of aromatics in your shop when you are\r\npounding the cumin: and therein are beds that you would find more goodly\r\nthan that of the Doge of Venice, and 'tis in them we take our rest; and\r\nhow busily they ply the treadle, and how lustily they tug at the frame to\r\nmake the stuff close and compact, I leave you to imagine. However, among\r\nthe luckiest of all I reckon Buffalmacco and myself; for that Buffalmacco\r\nfor the most part fetches him the Queen of France, and I do the like with\r\nthe Queen of England, who are just the finest women in the world, and we\r\nhave known how to carry it with them so that we are the very eyes of\r\ntheir heads. So I leave it to your own judgment to determine whether we\r\nhave not good cause to live and bear ourselves with a lighter heart than\r\nothers, seeing that we are beloved of two such great queens, to say\r\nnothing of the thousand or two thousand florins that we have of them\r\nwhenever we are so minded. Now this in the vulgar we call going the\r\ncourse, because, as the corsairs prey upon all the world, so do we;\r\nalbeit with this difference, that, whereas they never restore their\r\nspoil, we do so as soon as we have done with it. So now, my worthy\r\nMaster, you understand what we mean by going the course; but how close it\r\nbehoves you to keep such a secret, you may see for yourself; so I spare\r\nyou any further exhortations.\"\r\n\r\nThe Master, whose skill did not reach, perhaps, beyond the treatment of\r\nchildren for the scurf, took all that Bruno said for gospel, and burned\r\nwith so vehement a desire to be admitted into this company, that he could\r\nnot have longed for the summum bonum itself with more ardour. So, after\r\ntelling Bruno that indeed 'twas no wonder they bore them lightheartedly,\r\nhe could scarce refrain from asking him there and then to have him\r\nenrolled, albeit he deemed it more prudent to defer his suit, until by\r\nlavishing honour upon him he had gained a right to urge it with more\r\nconfidence. He therefore made more and more of him, had him to breakfast\r\nand sup with him, and treated him with extraordinary respect. In short,\r\nsuch and so constant was their intercourse that it seemed as though the\r\nMaster wist not how to live without Bruno. As it went so well with him,\r\nBruno, to mark his sense of the honour done him by the doctor, painted in\r\nhis saloon a picture symbolical of Lent, and an Agnus Dei at the entrance\r\nof his chamber, and an alembic over his front door, that those who would\r\nfain consult him might know him from other physicians, besides a battle\r\nof rats and mice in his little gallery, which the doctor thought an\r\nextremely fine piece. And from time to time, when he had not supped with\r\nthe Master, he would say to him:--\"Last night I was with the company, and\r\nbeing a little tired of the Queen of England, I fetched me the Gumedra of\r\nthe great Can of Tarisi.\" \"Gumedra,\" quoth the Master; \"what is she? I\r\nknow not the meaning of these words.\" \"Thereat, Master,\" replied Bruno,\r\n\"I marvel not; for I have heard tell that neither Porcograsso nor\r\nVannacena say aught thereof.\" \"Thou wouldst say Ippocrasso and Avicenna,\"\r\nreturned the Master. \"I'faith I know not,\" quoth Bruno. \"I as ill know\r\nthe meaning of your words as you of mine. But Gumedra in the speech of\r\nthe great Can signifies the same as Empress in ours. Ah! a fine woman you\r\nwould find her, and plenty of her! I warrant she would make you forget\r\nyour drugs and prescriptions and plasters.\" And so, Bruno from time to\r\ntime whetting the Master's appetite, and the Master at length thinking\r\nthat by his honourable entreatment of him he had fairly made a conquest\r\nof Bruno, it befell that one evening, while he held the light for Bruno,\r\nwho was at work on the battle of rats and mice, he determined to discover\r\nto him his desire; and as they were alone, thus he spoke:--\"God knows,\r\nBruno, that there lives not the man, for whom I would do as much as for\r\nthee: why, if thou wast to bid me go all the way from here to\r\nPeretola,(3) I almost think I would do so; wherefore I trust thou wilt\r\nnot deem it strange if I talk to thee as an intimate friend and in\r\nconfidence. Thou knowest 'tis not long since thou didst enlarge with me\r\non thy gay company and their doings, which has engendered in me such a\r\ndesire as never was to know more thereof. Nor without reason, as thou\r\nwilt discover, should I ever become a member of the said company, for I\r\nstraightway give thee leave to make game of me, should I not then fetch\r\nme the fairest maid thou hast seen this many a day, whom I saw last year\r\nat Cacavincigli, and to whom I am entirely devoted; and by the body of\r\nChrist I offered her ten Bolognese groats, that she should pleasure me,\r\nand she would not. Wherefore I do most earnestly entreat thee to instruct\r\nme what I must do to fit myself for membership in the company; and never\r\ndoubt that in me you will have a true and loyal comrade, and one that\r\nwill do you honour. And above all thou seest how goodly I am of my\r\nperson, and how well furnished with legs, and of face as fresh as a rose;\r\nand therewithal I am a doctor of medicine, and I scarce think you have\r\nany such among you; and not a little excellent lore I have, and many a\r\ngood song by heart, of which I will sing thee one;\" and forthwith he fell\r\na singing.\r\n\r\nBruno had such a mind to laugh, that he could scarce contain himself; but\r\nstill he kept a grave countenance; and, when the Master had ended his\r\nsong, and said:--\"How likes it thee?\" he answered:--\"Verily, no lyre of\r\nstraw could vie with you, so artargutically(4) you refine your strain.\"\r\n\"I warrant thee,\" returned the Master, \"thou hadst never believed it,\r\nhadst thou not heard me.\" \"Ay, indeed, sooth sayst thou,\" quoth Bruno.\r\n\"And I have other songs to boot,\" said the Master; \"but enough of this at\r\npresent. Thou must know that I, such as thou seest me, am a gentleman's\r\nson, albeit my father lived in the contado; and on my mother's side I\r\ncome of the Vallecchio family. And as thou mayst have observed I have\r\nquite the finest library and wardrobe of all the physicians in Florence.\r\nGod's faith! I have a robe that cost, all told, close upon a hundred\r\npounds in bagattines(5) more than ten years ago. Wherefore I make most\r\ninstant suit to thee that thou get me enrolled, which if thou do, God's\r\nfaith! be thou never so ill, thou shalt pay me not a stiver for my\r\ntendance of thee.\" Whereupon Bruno, repeating to himself, as he had done\r\nmany a time before, that the doctor was a very numskull:--\"Master,\" quoth\r\nhe, \"shew a little more light here, and have patience until I have put\r\nthe finishing touches to the tails of these rats, and then I will answer\r\nyou.\" So he finished the tails, and then, putting on an air as if he were\r\nnot a little embarrassed by the request:--\"Master mine,\" quoth he, \"I\r\nshould have great things to expect from you; that I know: but yet what\r\nyou ask of me, albeit to your great mind it seems but a little thing, is\r\na weighty matter indeed for me; nor know I a soul in the world, to whom,\r\nthough well able, I would grant such a request, save to you alone: and\r\nthis I say not for friendship's sake alone, albeit I love you as I ought,\r\nbut for that your discourse is so fraught with wisdom, that 'tis enough\r\nto make a beguine start out of her boots, much more, then, to incline me\r\nto change my purpose; and the more I have of your company, the wiser I\r\nrepute you. Whereto I may add, that, if for no other cause, I should\r\nstill be well disposed towards you for the love I see you bear to that\r\nfair piece of flesh of which you spoke but now. But this I must tell you:\r\n'tis not in my power to do as you would have me in this matter; but,\r\nthough I cannot myself do the needful in your behalf, if you will pledge\r\nyour faith, whole and solid as may be, to keep my secret, I will shew you\r\nhow to go about it for yourself, and I make no doubt that, having this\r\nfine library and the other matters you spoke of a while ago, you will\r\ncompass your end.\" Quoth then the Master:--\"Nay, but speak freely; I see\r\nthou dost yet scarce know me, and how well I can keep a secret. There\r\nwere few things that Messer Guasparruolo da Saliceto did, when he was\r\nPodesta of Forlinpopoli, that he did not confide to me, so safe he knew\r\nthey would be in my keeping: and wouldst thou be satisfied that I say\r\nsooth? I assure you I was the first man whom he told that he was about to\r\nmarry Bergamina: so there's for thee.\" \"Well and good,\" said Bruno, \"if\r\nsuch as he confided in you, well indeed may I do the like. Know, then,\r\nthat you will have to proceed on this wise:--Our company is governed by a\r\ncaptain and a council of two, who are changed every six months: and on\r\nthe calends without fail Buffalmacco will be captain, and I councillor:\r\n'tis so fixed: and the captain has not a little power to promote the\r\nadmission and enrolment of whomsoever he will: wherefore, methinks, you\r\nwould do well to make friends with Buffalmacco and honourably entreat\r\nhim: he is one that, marking your great wisdom, will take a mighty liking\r\nto you forthwith; and when you have just a little dazzled him with your\r\nwisdom and these fine things of yours, you may make your request to him;\r\nand he will not know how to say no--I have already talked with him of\r\nyou, and he is as well disposed to you as may be--and having so done you\r\nwill leave the rest to me.\" Whereupon:--\"Thy words are to me for an\r\nexceeding great joy,\" quoth the Master: \"and if he be one that loves to\r\nconverse with sages, he has but to exchange a word or two with me, and I\r\nwill answer for it that he will be ever coming to see me; for so fraught\r\nwith wisdom am I, that I could furnish a whole city therewith, and still\r\nremain a great sage.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus set matters in train, Bruno related the whole affair, point\r\nby point, to Buffalmacco, to whom it seemed a thousand years till he\r\nshould be able to give Master Noodle that of which he was in quest. The\r\ndoctor, now all agog to go the course, lost no time, and found no\r\ndifficulty, in making friends with Buffalmacco, and fell to entertaining\r\nhim, and Bruno likewise, at breakfast and supper in most magnificent\r\nstyle; while they fooled him to the top of his bent; for, being gentlemen\r\nthat appreciated excellent wines and fat capons, besides other good cheer\r\nin plenty, they were inclined to be very neighbourly, and needed no\r\nsecond bidding, but, always letting him understand that there was none\r\nother whose company they relished so much, kept ever with him.\r\n\r\nHowever, in due time the Master asked of Buffalmacco that which he had\r\nbefore asked of Bruno. Whereat Buffalmacco feigned to be not a little\r\nagitated, and turning angrily to Bruno, made a great pother about his\r\nears, saying:--\"By the Most High God of Pasignano I vow I can scarce\r\nforbear to give thee that over the head that should make thy nose fall\r\nabout thy heels, traitor that thou art, for 'tis thou alone that canst\r\nhave discovered these secrets to the Master.\" Whereupon the Master\r\ninterposed with no little vigour, averring with oaths that 'twas from\r\nanother source that he had gotten his knowledge; and Buffalmacco at\r\nlength allowed himself to be pacified by the sage's words. So turning to\r\nhim:--\"Master,\" quoth he, \"'tis evident indeed that you have been at\r\nBologna, and have come back hither with a mouth that blabs not, and that\r\n'twas on no pippin, as many a dolt does, but on the good long pumpkin\r\nthat you learned your A B C; and, if I mistake not, you were baptized on\r\na Sunday;(6) and though Bruno has told me that 'twas medicine you studied\r\nthere, 'tis my opinion that you there studied the art of catching men, of\r\nwhich, what with your wisdom and your startling revelations, you are the\r\ngreatest master that ever I knew.\" He would have said more, but the\r\ndoctor, turning to Bruno, broke in with:--\"Ah! what it is to consort and\r\nconverse with the wise! Who but this worthy man would thus have read my\r\nmind through and through? Less quick by far to rate me at my true worth\r\nwast thou. But what said I when thou toldst me that Buffalmacco delighted\r\nto converse with sages? Confess now; have I not kept my word?\" \"Verily,\"\r\nquoth Bruno, \"you have more than kept it.\" Then, addressing\r\nBuffalmacco:--\"Ah!\" cried the Master, \"what hadst thou said, hadst thou\r\nseen me at Bologna, where there was none, great or small, doctor or\r\nscholar, but was devoted to me, so well wist I how to entertain them with\r\nmy words of wisdom. Nay more; let me tell thee that there was never a\r\nword I spoke but set every one a laughing, so great was the pleasure it\r\ngave them. And at my departure they all deplored it most bitterly, and\r\nwould have had me remain, and by way of inducement went so far as to\r\npropose that I should be sole lecturer to all the students in medicine\r\nthat were there; which offer I declined, for that I was minded to return\r\nhither, having vast estates here, that have ever belonged to my family;\r\nwhich, accordingly, I did.\" Quoth then Bruno to Buffalmacco:--\"How shews\r\nit, now, man? Thou didst not believe me when I told thee what he was. By\r\nthe Gospels there is never a physician in this city that has the lore of\r\nass's urine by heart as he has: verily, thou wouldst not find his like\r\nbetween here and the gates of Paris. Now see if thou canst help doing as\r\nhe would have thee.\" \"'Tis even as Bruno says,\" observed the doctor, \"but\r\nI am not understood here. You Florentines are somewhat slow of wit. Would\r\nyou could see me in my proper element, among a company of doctors!\"\r\nWhereupon:--\"Of a truth, Master,\" quoth Buffalmacco, \"your lore far\r\nexceeds any I should ever have imputed to you; wherefore, addressing you\r\nas 'tis meet to address a man of your wisdom, I give you disjointedly to\r\nunderstand that without fail I will procure your enrolment in our\r\ncompany.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this promise the honours lavished by the doctor upon the two men\r\ngrew and multiplied; in return for which they diverted themselves by\r\nsetting him a prancing upon every wildest chimera in the world; and\r\npromised, among other matters, to give him by way of mistress, the\r\nCountess of Civillari,(7) whom they averred to be the goodliest creature\r\nto be found in all the Netherlands of the human race; and the doctor\r\nasking who this Countess might be:--\"Mature my gherkin,\" quoth\r\nBuffalmacco, \"she is indeed a very great lady, and few houses are there\r\nin the world in which she has not some jurisdiction; nay, the very Friars\r\nMinors, to say nought of other folk, pay her tribute to the sound of the\r\nkettle-drum. And I may tell you that, when she goes abroad, she makes her\r\npresence very sensibly felt, albeit for the most part she keeps herself\r\nclose: however, 'tis no great while since she passed by your door one\r\nnight on her way to the Arno to bathe her feet and get a breath of air;\r\nbut most of her time she abides at Laterina.(8) Serjeants has she not a\r\nfew that go their rounds at short intervals, bearing, one and all, the\r\nrod and the bucket in token of her sovereignty, and barons in plenty in\r\nall parts, as Tamagnino della Porta,(9) Don Meta,(10) Manico di\r\nScopa,(11) Squacchera,(12) and others, with whom I doubt not you are\r\nintimately acquainted, though you may not just now bear them in mind.\r\nSuch, then, is the great lady, in whose soft arms we, if we delude not\r\nourselves, will certainly place you, in which case you may well dispense\r\nwith her of Cacavincigli.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who had been born and bred at Bologna, and understood not\r\ntheir words, found the lady quite to his mind; and shortly afterwards the\r\npainters brought him tidings of his election into the company. Then came\r\nthe day of the nocturnal gathering, and the doctor had the two men to\r\nbreakfast; and when they had breakfasted, he asked them after what manner\r\nhe was to join the company. Whereupon:--\"Lo, now, Master,\" quoth\r\nBuffalmacco, \"you have need of a stout heart; otherwise you may meet with\r\nsome let, to our most grievous hurt; and for what cause you have need of\r\nthis stout heart, you shall hear. You must contrive to be to-night about\r\nthe hour of first sleep on one of the raised tombs that have been lately\r\nplaced outside of Santa Maria Novella; and mind that you wear one of your\r\nbest gowns, that your first appearance may impress the company with a\r\nproper sense of your dignity, and also because, as we are informed, for\r\nwe were not present at the time, the Countess, by reason that you are a\r\ngentleman, is minded to make you a Knight of the Bath at her own charges.\r\nSo you will wait there, until one, whom we shall send, come for you: who,\r\nthat you may know exactly what you have to expect, will be a beast black\r\nand horned, of no great size; and he will go snorting and bounding amain\r\nabout the piazza in front of you, with intent to terrify you; but, when\r\nhe perceives that you are not afraid, he will draw nigh you quietly, and\r\nwhen he is close by you, then get you down from the tomb, fearing\r\nnothing; and, minding you neither of God nor of the saints, mount him,\r\nand when you are well set on his back, then fold your arms upon your\r\nbreast, as in submission, and touch him no more. Then, going gently, he\r\nwill bear you to us; but once mind you of God, or the saints, or give way\r\nto fear, and I warn you, he might give you a fall, or dash you against\r\nsomething that you would find scarce pleasant; wherefore, if your heart\r\nmisgives you, you were best not to come, for you would assuredly do\r\nyourself a mischief, and us no good at all.\" Quoth then the doctor:--\"You\r\nknow me not as yet; 'tis perchance because I wear the gloves and the long\r\nrobe that you misdoubt me. Ah! did you but know what feats I have done in\r\ntimes past at Bologna, when I used to go after the women with my\r\ncomrades, you would be lost in amazement. God's faith! on one of those\r\nnights there was one of them, a poor sickly creature she was too, and\r\nstood not a cubit in height, who would not come with us; so first I\r\ntreated her to many a good cuff, and then I took her up by main force,\r\nand carried her well-nigh as far as a cross-bow will send a bolt, and so\r\ncaused her, willy-nilly, come with us. And on another occasion I mind me\r\nthat, having none other with me but my servant, a little after the hour\r\nof Ave Maria, I passed beside the cemetery of the Friars Minors, and,\r\nthough that very day a woman had been there interred, I had no fear at\r\nall. So on this score you may make your minds easy; for indeed I am a man\r\nof exceeding great courage and prowess. And to appear before you with due\r\ndignity, I will don my scarlet gown, in which I took my doctor's degree,\r\nand it remains to be seen if the company will not give me a hearty\r\nwelcome, and make me captain out of hand. Let me once be there, and you\r\nwill see how things will go; else how is it that this countess, that has\r\nnot yet seen me, is already so enamoured of me that she is minded to make\r\nme a Knight of the Bath? And whether I shall find knighthood agreeable,\r\nor know how to support the dignity well or ill, leave that to me.\"\r\nWhereupon:--\"Well said, excellent well said,\" quoth Buffalmacco: \"but\r\nlook to it you disappoint us not, either by not coming or by not being\r\nfound, when we send for you; and this I say, because 'tis cold weather,\r\nand you medical gentlemen take great care of your health.\" \"God forbid,\"\r\nreplied the doctor, \"I am none of your chilly folk; I fear not the cold:\r\n'tis seldom indeed, when I leave my bed a nights, to answer the call of\r\nnature, as one must at times, that I do more than throw a pelisse over my\r\ndoublet; so rest assured that I shall be there.\"\r\n\r\nSo they parted; and towards nightfall the Master found a pretext for\r\nleaving his wife, and privily got out his fine gown, which in due time he\r\ndonned, and so hied him to the tombs, and having perched himself on one\r\nof them, huddled himself together, for 'twas mighty cold, to await the\r\ncoming of the beast. Meanwhile Buffalmacco, who was a tall man and\r\nstrong, provided himself with one of those dominos that were wont to be\r\nworn in certain revels which are now gone out of fashion; and enveloped\r\nin a black pelisse turned inside out, shewed like a bear, save that the\r\ndomino had the face of a devil, and was furnished with horns: in which\r\nguise, Bruno following close behind to see the sport, he hied him to the\r\npiazza of Santa Maria Novella. And no sooner wist he that the Master was\r\non the tomb, than he fell a careering in a most wild and furious manner\r\nto and fro the piazza, and snorting and bellowing and gibbering like one\r\ndemented, insomuch that, as soon as the Master was ware of him, each\r\nseveral hair on his head stood on end, and he fell a trembling in every\r\nlimb, being in sooth more timid than a woman, and wished himself safe at\r\nhome: but as there he was, he strove might and main to keep his spirits\r\nup, so overmastering was his desire to see the marvels of which Bruno and\r\nBuffalmacco had told him. However, after a while Buffalmacco allowed his\r\nfury to abate, and came quietly up to the tomb on which the Master was,\r\nand stood still. The Master, still all of a tremble with fear, could not\r\nat first make up his mind, whether to get on the beast's back, or no; but\r\nat length, doubting it might be the worse for him if he did not mount the\r\nbeast, he overcame the one dread by the aid of the other, got down from\r\nthe tomb, saying under his breath:--\"God help me!\" and seated himself\r\nvery comfortably on the beast's back; and then, still quaking in every\r\nlimb, he folded his arms as he had been bidden.\r\n\r\nBuffalmacco now started, going on all-fours, at a very slow pace, in the\r\ndirection of Santa Maria della Scala, and so brought the Master within a\r\nshort distance of the Convent of the Ladies of Ripoli. Now, in that\r\nquarter there were divers trenches, into which the husbandmen of those\r\nparts were wont to discharge the Countess of Civillari, that she might\r\nafterwards serve them to manure their land. Of one of which trenches, as\r\nhe came by, Buffalmacco skirted the edge, and seizing his opportunity,\r\nraised a hand, and caught the doctor by one of his feet, and threw him\r\noff his back and headforemost right into the trench, and then, making a\r\nterrific noise and frantic gestures as before, went bounding off by Santa\r\nMaria della Scala towards the field of Ognissanti, where he found Bruno,\r\nwho had betaken him thither that he might laugh at his ease; and there\r\nthe two men in high glee took their stand to observe from a distance how\r\nthe bemired doctor would behave. Finding himself in so loathsome a place,\r\nthe Master struggled might and main to raise himself and get out; and\r\nthough again and again he slipped back, and swallowed some drams of the\r\nordure, yet, bemired from head to foot, woebegone and crestfallen, he did\r\nat last get out, leaving his hood behind him. Then, removing as much of\r\nthe filth as he might with his hands, knowing not what else to do, he got\r\nhim home, where, by dint of much knocking, he at last gained admittance;\r\nand scarce was the door closed behind the malodorous Master, when Bruno\r\nand Buffalmacco were at it, all agog to hear after what manner he would\r\nbe received by his wife. They were rewarded by hearing her give him the\r\nsoundest rating that ever bad husband got. \"Ah!\" quoth she, \"fine doings,\r\nthese! Thou hast been with some other woman, and wast minded to make a\r\nbrave shew in thy scarlet gown. So I was not enough for thee! not enough\r\nfor thee forsooth, I that might content a crowd! Would they had choked\r\nthee with the filth in which they have soused thee; 'twas thy fit\r\nresting-place. Now, to think that a physician of repute, and a married\r\nman, should go by night after strange women!\" Thus, and with much more to\r\nthe like effect, while the doctor was busy washing himself, she ceased\r\nnot to torment him until midnight.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Bruno and Buffalmacco, having painted their bodies all\r\nover with livid patches to give them the appearance of having been\r\nthrashed, came to the doctor's house, and finding that he was already\r\nrisen, went in, being saluted on all hands by a foul smell, for time had\r\nnot yet served thoroughly to cleanse the house. The doctor, being\r\ninformed that they were come to see him, advanced to meet them, and bade\r\nthem good morning. Whereto Bruno and Buffalmacco, having prepared their\r\nanswer, replied:--\"No good morning shall you have from us: rather we pray\r\nGod to give you bad years enough to make an end of you, seeing that there\r\nlives no more arrant and faithless traitor. 'Tis no fault of yours, if\r\nwe, that did our best to honour and pleasure you, have not come by a\r\ndog's death; your faithlessness has cost us to-night as many sound blows\r\nas would more than suffice to keep an ass a trotting all the way from\r\nhere to Rome; besides which, we have been in peril of expulsion from the\r\ncompany in which we arranged for your enrolment. If you doubt our words,\r\nlook but at our bodies, what a state they are in.\" And so, baring their\r\nbreasts they gave him a glimpse of the patches they had painted there,\r\nand forthwith covered them up again. The doctor would have made them his\r\nexcuses, and recounted his misfortunes, and how he had been thrown into\r\nthe trench. But Buffalmacco broke in with:--\"Would he had thrown you from\r\nthe bridge into the Arno! Why must you needs mind you of God and the\r\nsaints? Did we not forewarn you?\" \"God's faith,\" returned the doctor,\r\n\"that did I not.\" \"How?\" quoth Buffalmacco, \"you did not? You do so above\r\na little; for he that we sent for you told us that you trembled like an\r\naspen, and knew not where you were. You have played us a sorry trick; but\r\nnever another shall do so; and as for you, we will give you such requital\r\nthereof as you deserve.\" The doctor now began to crave their pardon, and\r\nto implore them for God's sake not to expose him to shame, and used all\r\nthe eloquence at his command to make his peace with them. And if he had\r\nhonourably entreated them before, he thenceforth, for fear they should\r\npublish his disgrace, did so much more abundantly, and courted them both\r\nby entertaining them at his table and in other ways. And so you have\r\nheard how wisdom is imparted to those that get it not at Bologna.\r\n\r\n(1) The distinguishing mark of a doctor in those days. Fanfani, Vocab.\r\ndella Lingua Italiana, 1891, \"Batolo.\"\r\n\r\n(2) Perhaps an allusion to some frightful picture.\r\n\r\n(3) About four miles from Florence.\r\n\r\n(4) In the Italian \"artagoticamente,\" a word of Boccaccio's own minting.\r\n\r\n(5) A Venetian coin of extremely low value, being reckoned as 1\/4 of the\r\nFlorentine quattrino.\r\n\r\n(6) I.e. without salt, that Florentine symbol of wit, not being so\r\nreadily procurable on a holiday as on working-days.\r\n\r\n(7) A public sink at Florence.\r\n\r\n(8) In the contado of Arezzo: the equivoque is tolerably obvious.\r\n\r\n(9) Slang for an ill-kept jakes.\r\n\r\n(10) Also slang: signifying a pyramidal pile of ordure.\r\n\r\n(11) Broom-handle.\r\n\r\n(12) The meaning of this term may perhaps be divined from the sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL X.\r\n\r\n--\r\nA Sicilian woman cunningly conveys from a merchant that which he has\r\nbrought to Palermo; he, making a shew of being come back thither with far\r\ngreater store of goods than before, borrows money of her, and leaves her\r\nin lieu thereof water and tow.\r\n--\r\n\r\nHow much in divers passages the queen's story moved the ladies to\r\nlaughter, it boots not to ask: none was there in whose eyes the tears\r\nstood not full a dozen times for excess of merriment. However, it being\r\nended, and Dioneo witting that 'twas now his turn, thus spake\r\nhe:--Gracious ladies, 'tis patent to all that wiles are diverting in the\r\ndegree of the wiliness of him that is by them beguiled. Wherefore, albeit\r\nstories most goodly have been told by you all, I purpose to relate one\r\nwhich should afford you more pleasure than any that has been told, seeing\r\nthat she that was beguiled was far more cunning in beguiling others than\r\nany of the beguiled of whom you have spoken.\r\n\r\nThere was, and perhaps still is, a custom in all maritime countries that\r\nhave ports, that all merchants arriving there with merchandise, should,\r\non discharging, bring all their goods into a warehouse, called in many\r\nplaces \"dogana,\" and maintained by the state, or the lord of the land;\r\nwhere those that are assigned to that office allot to each merchant, on\r\nreceipt of an invoice of all his goods and the value thereof, a room in\r\nwhich he stores his goods under lock and key; whereupon the said officers\r\nof the dogana enter all the merchant's goods to his credit in the book of\r\nthe dogana, and afterwards make him pay duty thereon, or on such part as\r\nhe withdraws from the warehouse. By which book of the dogana the brokers\r\nnot seldom find out the sorts and quantities of the merchandise that is\r\nthere, and also who are the owners thereof, with whom, as occasion\r\nserves, they afterwards treat of exchanges, barters, sales and other\r\nmodes of disposing of the goods. Which custom obtained, as in many other\r\nplaces, so also at Palermo in Sicily, where in like manner there were and\r\nare not a few women, fair as fair can be, but foes to virtue, who by\r\nwhoso knows them not would be reputed great and most virtuous ladies. And\r\nbeing given not merely to fleece but utterly to flay men, they no sooner\r\nespy a foreign merchant in the city, than they find out from the book of\r\nthe dogana how much he has there and what he is good for; and then by\r\ncaressing and amorous looks and gestures, and words of honeyed sweetness,\r\nthey strive to entice and allure the merchant to their love, and not\r\nseldom have they succeeded, and wrested from him great part or the whole\r\nof his merchandise; and of some they have gotten goods and ship and flesh\r\nand bones, so delightsomely have they known how to ply the shears.\r\n\r\nNow 'tis not long since one of our young Florentines, Niccolo da Cignano\r\nby name, albeit he was called Salabaetto, arrived there, being sent by\r\nhis masters with all the woollen stuffs that he had not been able to\r\ndispose of at Salerno fair, which might perhaps be worth five hundred\r\nflorins of gold; and having given the invoice to the officers of the\r\ndogana and stored the goods, Salabaetto was in no hurry to get them out\r\nof bond, but took a stroll or two about the city for his diversion. And\r\nas he was fresh-complexioned and fair and not a little debonair, it so\r\nbefell that one of these ladies that plied the shears, and called herself\r\nJancofiore, began to ogle him. Whereof he taking note, and deeming that\r\nshe was a great lady, supposed that she was taken by his good looks, and\r\ncast about how he might manage this amour with all due discretion;\r\nwherefore, saying nought to a soul, he began to pass to and fro before\r\nher house. Which she observing, occupied herself for a few days in\r\ninflaming his passion, and then affecting to be dying of love for him,\r\nsent privily to him a woman that she had in her service, and who was an\r\nadept in the arts of the procuress. She, after not a little palaver, told\r\nhim, while the tears all but stood in her eyes, that for his handsome\r\nperson and winsome air her mistress was so enamoured of him, that she\r\nfound no peace by day or by night; and therefore, if 'twere agreeable to\r\nhim, there was nought she desired so much as to meet him privily at a\r\nbagnio: whereupon she drew a ring from her purse, and gave it him by way\r\nof token from her mistress. Overjoyed as ne'er another to hear such good\r\nnews, Salabaetto took the ring, and, after drawing it across his eyes and\r\nkissing it, put it on his finger, and told the good woman that, if\r\nMadonna Jancofiore loved him, she was well requited, for that he loved\r\nher more dearly than himself, and that he was ready to meet her wherever\r\nand whenever she might see fit. With which answer the procuress hied her\r\nback to her mistress, and shortly afterwards Salabaetto was informed that\r\nhe was to meet the lady at a certain bagnio at vespers of the ensuing\r\nday.\r\n\r\nSo, saying nought to a soul of the matter, he hied him punctually at the\r\nappointed hour to the bagnio, and found that it had been taken by the\r\nlady; nor had he long to wait before two female slaves made their\r\nappearance, bearing on their heads, the one a great and goodly mattress\r\nof wadding, and the other a huge and well-filled basket; and having laid\r\nthe mattress on a bedstead in one of the rooms of the bagnio, they\r\ncovered it with a pair of sheets of the finest fabric, bordered with\r\nsilk, and a quilt of the whitest Cyprus buckram, with two\r\ndaintily-embroidered pillows. The slaves then undressed and got into the\r\nbath, which they thoroughly washed and scrubbed: whither soon afterwards\r\nthe lady, attended by other two female slaves, came, and made haste to\r\ngreet Salabaetto with the heartiest of cheer; and when, after heaving\r\nmany a mighty sigh, she had embraced and kissed him:--\"I know not,\" quoth\r\nshe, \"who but thou could have brought me to this, such a fire hast thou\r\nkindled in my soul, little dog of a Tuscan!\" Whereupon she was pleased\r\nthat they should undress, and get into the bath, and two of the slaves\r\nwith them; which, accordingly, they did; and she herself, suffering none\r\nother to lay a hand upon him, did with wondrous care wash Salabaetto from\r\nhead to foot with soap perfumed with musk and cloves; after which she let\r\nthe slaves wash and shampoo herself. The slaves then brought two spotless\r\nsheets of finest texture, which emitted such a scent of roses, that 'twas\r\nas if there was nought there but roses, in one of which having wrapped\r\nSalabaetto, and in the other the lady, they bore them both to bed, where,\r\nthe sheets in which they were enfolded being withdrawn by the slaves as\r\nsoon as they had done sweating, they remained stark naked in the others.\r\nThe slaves then took from the basket cruets of silver most goodly, and\r\nfull, this of rose-water, that of water of orange-blossom, a third of\r\nwater of jasmine-blossom, and a fourth of nanfa(1) water, wherewith they\r\nsprinkled them: after which, boxes of comfits and the finest wines being\r\nbrought forth, they regaled them a while. To Salabaetto 'twas as if he\r\nwere in Paradise; a thousand times he scanned the lady, who was indeed\r\nmost beautiful; and he counted each hour as a hundred years until the\r\nslaves should get them gone, and he find himself in the lady's arms.\r\n\r\nAt length, by the lady's command, the slaves departed, leaving a lighted\r\ntorch in the room, and then the lady and Salabaetto embraced, and to\r\nSalabaetto's prodigious delight, for it seemed to him that she was all\r\nbut dissolved for love of him, tarried there a good while. However, the\r\ntime came when the lady must needs rise: so she called the slaves, with\r\nwhose help they dressed, regaled them again for a while with wine and\r\ncomfits, and washed their faces and hands with the odoriferous waters.\r\nThen as they were going, quoth the lady to Salabaetto:--\"If it be\r\nagreeable to thee, I should deem it a very great favour if thou wouldst\r\ncome to-night to sup and sleep with me.\" Salabaetto, who, captivated by\r\nher beauty and her studied graciousness, never doubted but he was dear to\r\nher as her very heart, made answer:--\"Madam, there is nought you can\r\ndesire but is in the last degree agreeable to me; wherefore to-night and\r\never 'tis my purpose to do whatsoever you may be pleased to command.\" So\r\nhome the lady hied her, and having caused a brave shew to be made in her\r\nchamber with her dresses and other paraphernalia, and a grand supper to\r\nbe prepared, awaited Salabaetto; who, being come there as soon as 'twas\r\ndark, had of her a gladsome welcome, and was regaled with an excellent\r\nand well-served supper. After which, they repaired to the chamber, where\r\nhe was saluted by a wondrous sweet odour of aloe-wood, and observed that\r\nthe bed was profusely furnished with birds,(2) after the fashion of\r\nCyprus, and that not a few fine dresses were hanging upon the pegs. Which\r\ncircumstances did, one and all, beget in him the belief that this must be\r\na great and wealthy lady; and, though he had heard a hint or two to the\r\ncontrary touching her life, he would by no means credit them; nor,\r\nsupposing that she had perchance taken another with guile, would he\r\nbelieve that the same thing might befall him. So to his exceeding great\r\nsolace, he lay with her that night, and ever grew more afire for her. On\r\nthe morrow, as she was investing him with a fair and dainty girdle of\r\nsilver, with a goodly purse attached:--\"Sweet my Salabaetto,\" quoth she,\r\n\"prithee forget me not; even as my person, so is all that I have at thy\r\npleasure, and all that I can at thy command.\"\r\n\r\nSalabaetto then embraced and kissed her, and so bade her adieu, and\r\nbetook him to the place where the merchants were wont to congregate. And\r\nso it befell that he, continuing to consort with her from time to time,\r\nand being never a denier the poorer thereby, disposed of his merchandise\r\nfor ready money and at no small profit; whereof not by him but by another\r\nthe lady was forthwith advised. And Salabaetto being come to see her one\r\nevening, she greeted him gaily and gamesomely, and fell a kissing and\r\nhugging him, and made as if she were so afire for love of him that she\r\nwas like to die thereof in his arms; and offered to give him two most\r\ngoodly silver cups that she had, which Salabaetto would not accept,\r\nhaving already had from her (taking one time with another) fully thirty\r\nflorins of gold, while he had not been able to induce her to touch so\r\nmuch as a groat of his money. But when by this shew of passion and\r\ngenerosity she had thoroughly kindled his flame, in came, as she had\r\narranged, one of her slaves, and spoke to her; whereupon out of the room\r\nshe went, and after a while came back in tears, and threw herself prone\r\non the bed, and set up the most dolorous lamentation that ever woman\r\nmade. Whereat Salabaetto wondering, took her in his arms, and mingled his\r\ntears with hers, and said:--\"Alas! heart of my body! what ails thee thus\r\nof a sudden? Wherefore art thou so distressed? Ah! tell me the reason, my\r\nsoul.\" The lady allowed him to run on in this strain for a good while,\r\nand then:--\"Alas! sweet my lord,\" quoth she, \"I know not either what to\r\ndo or what to say. I have but now received a letter from Messina, in\r\nwhich my brother bids me sell, if need be, all that I have here, and send\r\nhim without fail within eight days a thousand florins of gold: otherwise\r\nhe will forfeit his head. I know not how to come by them so soon: had I\r\nbut fifteen days, I would make a shift to raise them in a quarter where I\r\nmight raise a much larger sum, or I would sell one of our estates; but,\r\nas this may not be, would I had been dead or e'er this bad news had\r\nreached me!\" Which said, affecting to be utterly broken-hearted, she\r\nceased not to weep.\r\n\r\nSalabaetto, the ardour of whose passion had in great measure deprived him\r\nof the sagacity which the circumstances demanded, supposed that the tears\r\nwere genuine enough, and the words even more so. Wherefore:--\"Madam,\"\r\nquoth he, \"I could not furnish you with a thousand, but if five hundred\r\nflorins of gold would suffice, they are at your service, if you think you\r\ncould repay them within fifteen days; and you may deem yourself in luck's\r\nway, for 'twas only yesterday that I sold my woollens, which had I not\r\ndone, I could not have lent you a groat.\" \"Alas\" returned the lady, \"then\r\nthou hast been in straits for money? Oh! why didst thou not apply to me?\r\nThough I have not a thousand at my command, I could have given thee quite\r\na hundred, nay indeed two hundred florins. By what thou hast said thou\r\nhast made me hesitate to accept the service that thou proposest to render\r\nme.\" Which words fairly delivered Salabaetto into the lady's hands,\r\ninsomuch that:--\"Madam,\" quoth he, \"I would not have you decline my help\r\nfor such a scruple; for had my need been as great as yours, I should\r\ncertainly have applied to you.\" Quoth then the lady:--\"Ah! Salabaetto\r\nmine, well I wot that the love thou bearest me is a true and perfect\r\nlove, seeing that, without waiting to be asked, thou dost so handsomely\r\ncome to my aid with so large a sum of money. And albeit I was thine\r\nwithout this token of thy love, yet, assuredly, it has made me thine in\r\nan even greater degree; nor shall I ever forget that 'tis to thee I owe\r\nmy brother's life. But God knows I take thy money from thee reluctantly,\r\nseeing that thou art a merchant, and 'tis by means of money that\r\nmerchants conduct all their affairs; but, as necessity constrains me, and\r\nI have good hope of speedily repaying thee, I will even take it, and by\r\nway of security, if I should find no readier method, I will pawn all that\r\nI have here.\" Which said, she burst into tears, and fell upon Salabaetto,\r\npressing her cheek upon his.\r\n\r\nSalabaetto tried to comfort her; and having spent the night with her, on\r\nthe morrow, being minded to shew himself her most devoted servant,\r\nbrought her, without awaiting any reminder, five hundred fine florins of\r\ngold: which she, laughing at heart while the tears streamed from her\r\neyes, took, Salabaetto trusting her mere promise of repayment. Now that\r\nthe lady had gotten the money, the complexion of affairs began to alter;\r\nand whereas Salabaetto had been wont to have free access to her, whenever\r\nhe was so minded, now for one reason or another he was denied admittance\r\nsix times out of seven; nor did she greet him with the same smile, or\r\nshower on him the same caresses, or do him the same cheer as of yore. So\r\na month, two months, passed beyond the time when he was to have been\r\nrepaid his money; and when he demanded it, he was put off with words.\r\nWhereby Salabaetto, being now ware of the cheat which his slender wit had\r\nsuffered the evil-disposed woman to put upon him, and also that, having\r\nneither writing nor witness against her, he was entirely at her mercy in\r\nregard of his claim, and being, moreover, ashamed to lodge any complaint\r\nwith any one, as well because he had been forewarned of her character, as\r\nbecause he dreaded the ridicule to which his folly justly exposed him,\r\nwas chagrined beyond measure, and inly bewailed his simplicity. And his\r\nmasters having written to him, bidding him change the money and remit it\r\nto them, he, being apprehensive that, making default as he must, he\r\nshould, if he remained there, be detected, resolved to depart; and having\r\ntaken ship, he repaired, not, as he should have done, to Pisa, but to\r\nNaples; where at that time resided our gossip, Pietro dello Canigiano,\r\ntreasurer of the Empress of Constantinople, a man of great sagacity and\r\nacuteness, and a very great friend of Salabaetto and his kinsfolk; to\r\nwhom trusting in his great discretion, Salabaetto after a while\r\ndiscovered his distress, telling him what he had done, and the sorry\r\nplight in which by consequence he stood, and craving his aid and counsel,\r\nthat he might the more readily find means of livelihood there, for that\r\nhe was minded never to go back to Florence. Impatient to hear of such\r\nfolly:--\"'Twas ill done of thee,\" quoth Canigiano, \"thou hast misbehaved\r\nthyself, wronged thy masters, and squandered an exorbitant sum in\r\nlewdness; however, 'tis done, and we must consider of the remedy.\" And\r\nindeed, like the shrewd man that he was, he had already bethought him\r\nwhat was best to be done; and forthwith he imparted it to Salabaetto.\r\nWhich expedient Salabaetto approving, resolved to make the adventure; and\r\nhaving still a little money, and being furnished with a loan by\r\nCanigiano, he provided himself with not a few bales well and closely\r\ncorded, and bought some twenty oil-casks, which he filled, and having put\r\nall on shipboard, returned to Palermo. There he gave the invoice of the\r\nbales, as also of the oil-casks, to the officers of the dogana, and\r\nhaving them all entered to his credit, laid them up in the store-rooms,\r\nsaying that he purposed to leave them there until the arrival of other\r\nmerchandise that he expected.\r\n\r\nWhich Jancofiore learning, and being informed that the merchandise, that\r\nhe had brought with him, was worth fully two thousand florins of gold, or\r\neven more, besides that which he expected, which was valued at more than\r\nthree thousand florins of gold, bethought her that she had not aimed high\r\nenough, and that 'twere well to refund him the five hundred, if so she\r\nmight make the greater part of the five thousand florins her own.\r\nWherefore she sent for him, and Salabaetto, having learned his lesson of\r\ncunning, waited on her. Feigning to know nought of the cargo he had\r\nbrought with him, she received him with marvellous cheer, and\r\nbegan:--\"Lo, now, if thou wast angry with me because I did not repay thee\r\nthy money in due time:\" but Salabaetto interrupted her, saying with a\r\nlaugh:--\"Madam 'tis true I was a little vexed, seeing that I would have\r\nplucked out my heart to pleasure you; but listen, and you shall learn the\r\nquality of my displeasure. Such and so great is the love I bear you, that\r\nI have sold the best part of all that I possess, whereby I have already\r\nin this port merchandise to the value of more than two thousand florins,\r\nand expect from the Levant other goods to the value of above three\r\nthousand florins, and mean to set up a warehouse in this city, and live\r\nhere, to be ever near you, for that I deem myself more blessed in your\r\nlove than any other lover that lives.\" Whereupon:--\"Harkye, Salabaetto,\"\r\nquoth the lady, \"whatever advantages thee is mighty grateful to me,\r\nseeing that I love thee more than my very life, and right glad am I that\r\nthou art come back with intent to stay, for I hope to have many a good\r\ntime with thee; but something I must say to thee by way of excuse, for\r\nthat, whilst thou wast thinking of taking thy departure, there were times\r\nwhen thou wast disappointed of seeing me, and others when thou hadst not\r\nas gladsome a welcome as thou wast wont to have, and therewithal I kept\r\nnot the time promised for the repayment of thy money. Thou must know that\r\nI was then in exceeding great trouble and tribulation, and whoso is thus\r\nbested, love he another never so much, cannot greet him with as gladsome\r\na mien, or be as attentive to him, as he had lief; and thou must further\r\nknow that 'tis by no means an easy matter for a lady to come by a\r\nthousand florins of gold: why, 'tis every day a fresh lie, and never a\r\npromise kept; and so we in our turn must needs lie to others; and 'twas\r\nfor this cause, and not for any fault of mine, that I did not repay thee\r\nthy money; however, I had it but a little while after thy departure, and\r\nhad I known whither to send it, be sure I would have remitted it to thee;\r\nbut, as that I wist not, I have kept it safe for thee.\" She then produced\r\na purse, in which were the very same coins that he had brought her, and\r\nplaced it in his hand, saying:--\"Count and see if there are five hundred\r\nthere.\" 'Twas the happiest moment Salabaetto had yet known, as, having\r\ntold them out, and found the sum exact, he made answer:--\"Madam, I know\r\nthat you say sooth, and what you have done abundantly proves it;\r\nwherefore, and for the love I bear you, I warrant you there is no sum you\r\nmight ask of me on any occasion of need, with which, if 'twere in my\r\npower, I would not accommodate you; whereof, when I am settled here, you\r\nwill be able to assure yourself.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus in words reinstated himself as her lover, he proceeded to\r\ntreat her as his mistress, whereto she responded, doing all that was in\r\nher power to pleasure and honour him, and feigning to be in the last\r\ndegree enamoured of him. But Salabaetto, being minded to requite her\r\nguile with his own, went to her one evening, being bidden to sup and\r\nsleep with her, with an aspect so melancholy and dolorous, that he shewed\r\nas he had lief give up the ghost. Jancofiore, as she embraced and kissed\r\nhim, demanded of him the occasion of his melancholy. Whereto he, having\r\nlet her be instant with him a good while, made answer:--\"I am undone, for\r\nthat the ship, having aboard her the goods that I expected, has been\r\ntaken by the corsairs of Monaco, and held to ransom in ten thousand\r\nflorins of gold, of which it falls to me to pay one thousand, and I have\r\nnot a denier, for the five hundred thou repaidst me I sent forthwith to\r\nNaples to buy stuffs for this market, and were I to sell the merchandise\r\nI have here, as 'tis not now the right time to sell, I should scarce get\r\nhalf the value; nor am I as yet so well known here as to come by any to\r\nhelp me at this juncture, and so what to do or what to say I know not;\r\nbut this I know that, if I send not the money without delay, my\r\nmerchandise will be taken to Monaco, and I shall never touch aught of it\r\nagain.\" Whereat the lady was mightily annoyed, being apprehensive of\r\nlosing all, and bethought her how she might prevent the goods going to\r\nMonaco: wherefore:--\"God knows,\" quoth she, \"that for the love I bear\r\nthee I am not a little sorry for thee: but what boots it idly to distress\r\noneself? Had I the money, God knows I would lend it thee forthwith, but I\r\nhave it not. One, indeed, there is that accommodated me a day or two ago\r\nwith five hundred florins that I stood in need of, but he requires a\r\nheavy usance, not less than thirty on the hundred, and if thou shouldst\r\nhave recourse to him, good security must be forthcoming. Now for my part\r\nI am ready, so I may serve thee, to pledge all these dresses, and my\r\nperson to boot, for as much as he will tend thee thereon; but how wilt\r\nthou secure the balance?\"\r\n\r\nSalabaetto divined the motive that prompted her thus to accommodate him,\r\nand that she was to lend the money herself; which suiting his purpose\r\nwell, he first of all thanked her, and then said that, being constrained\r\nby necessity, he would not stand out against exorbitant terms, adding\r\nthat, as to the balance, he would secure it upon the merchandise that he\r\nhad at the dogana by causing it to be entered in the name of the lender;\r\nbut that he must keep the key of the storerooms, as well that he might be\r\nable to shew the goods, if requested, as to make sure that none of them\r\nshould be tampered with or changed or exchanged. The lady said that this\r\nwas reasonable, and that 'twas excellent security. So, betimes on the\r\nmorrow, the lady sent for a broker, in whom she reposed much trust, and\r\nhaving talked the matter over with him, gave him a thousand florins of\r\ngold, which the broker took to Salabaetto, and thereupon had all that\r\nSalabaetto had at the dogana entered in his name; they then had the\r\nscript and counterscript made out, and, the arrangement thus concluded,\r\nwent about their respective affairs. Salabaetto lost no time in getting\r\naboard a bark with his five hundred florins of gold, and being come to\r\nNaples, sent thence a remittance which fully discharged his obligation to\r\nhis masters that had entrusted him with the stuffs: he also paid all that\r\nhe owed to Pietro dello Canigiano and all his other creditors, and made\r\nnot a little merry with Canigiano over the trick he had played the\r\nSicilian lady. He then departed from Naples, and being minded to have\r\ndone with mercantile affairs, betook him to Ferrara.\r\n\r\nJancofiore, surprised at first by Salabaetto's disappearance from\r\nPalermo, waxed after a while suspicious; and, when she had waited fully\r\ntwo months, seeing that he did not return, she caused the broker to break\r\nopen the store-rooms. And trying first of all the casks, she found them\r\nfull of sea-water, save that in each there was perhaps a hog's-head of\r\noil floating on the surface. Then undoing the bales, she found them all,\r\nsave two that contained stuffs, full of tow, and in short their whole\r\ncontents put together were not worth more than two hundred florins.\r\nWherefore Jancofiore, knowing herself to have been outdone, regretted\r\nlong and bitterly the five hundred florins of gold that she had refunded,\r\nand still more the thousand that she had lent, repeating many a time to\r\nherself:--Who with a Tuscan has to do, Had need of eyesight quick and\r\ntrue. Thus, left with the loss and the laugh against her, she discovered\r\nthat there were others as knowing as she.\r\n\r\n(1) Neither the Vocab. degli Accad. della Crusca nor the Ricchezze\r\nattempts to define the precise nature of this scent, which Fanfani\r\nidentifies with that of the orange-blossom.\r\n\r\n(2) I.e. with a sort of musical boxes in the shape of birds.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Dioneo's story ended, than Lauretta, witting that therewith\r\nthe end of her sovereignty was come, bestowed her meed of praise on\r\nPietro Canigiano for his good counsel, and also on Salabaetto for the\r\nequal sagacity which he displayed in carrying it out, and then, taking\r\noff the laurel wreath, set it on the head of Emilia, saying\r\ngraciously:--\"I know not, Madam, how debonair a queen you may prove, but\r\nat least we shall have in you a fair one. Be it your care, then, that you\r\nexercise your authority in a manner answerable to your charms.\" Which\r\nsaid, she resumed her seat.\r\n\r\nNot so much to receive the crown, as to be thus commended to her face and\r\nbefore the company for that which ladies are wont to covet the most,\r\nEmilia was a little shamefast; a tint like that of the newly-blown rose\r\noverspread her face, and a while she stood silent with downcast eyes:\r\nthen, as the blush faded away, she raised them; and having given her\r\nseneschal her commands touching all matters pertaining to the company,\r\nthus she spake:--\"Sweet my ladies, 'tis matter of common experience that,\r\nwhen the oxen have swunken a part of the day under the coercive yoke,\r\nthey are relieved thereof and loosed, and suffered to go seek their\r\npasture at their own sweet will in the woods; nor can we fail to observe\r\nthat gardens luxuriant with diversity of leafage are not less, but far\r\nmore fair to see, than woods wherein is nought but oaks. Wherefore I deem\r\nthat, as for so many days our discourse has been confined within the\r\nbounds of certain laws, 'twill be not only meet but profitable for us,\r\nbeing in need of relaxation, to roam a while, and so recruit our strength\r\nto undergo the yoke once more. And therefore I am minded that to-morrow\r\nthe sweet tenor of your discourse be not confined to any particular\r\ntheme, but that you be at liberty to discourse on such wise as to each\r\nmay seem best; for well assured am I that thus to speak of divers matters\r\nwill be no less pleasurable than to limit ourselves to one topic; and by\r\nreason of this enlargement my successor in the sovereignty will find you\r\nmore vigorous, and be therefore all the more forward to reimpose upon you\r\nthe wonted restraint of our laws.\" Having so said, she dismissed all the\r\ncompany until supper-time.\r\n\r\nAll approved the wisdom of what the queen had said; and being risen\r\nbetook them to their several diversions, the ladies to weave garlands and\r\notherwise disport them, the young men to play and sing; and so they\r\nwhiled away the hours until supper-time; which being come, they gathered\r\nabout the fair fountain, and took their meal with gay and festal cheer.\r\nSupper ended, they addressed them to their wonted pastime of song and\r\ndance. At the close of which the queen, notwithstanding the songs which\r\ndivers of the company had already gladly accorded them, called for\r\nanother from Pamfilo, who without the least demur thus sang:--\r\n\r\nSo great, O Love, the bliss\r\n  Through thee I prove, so jocund my estate,\r\n  That in thy flame to burn I bless my fate!\r\n\r\nSuch plenitude of joy my heart doth know\r\n  Of that high joy and rare,\r\n  Wherewith thou hast me blest,\r\n  As, bounds disdaining, still doth overflow,\r\n  And by my radiant air\r\n  My blitheness manifest;\r\n  For by thee thus possessed\r\n  With love, where meeter 'twere to venerate,\r\n  I still consume within thy flame elate.\r\n\r\nWell wot I, Love, no song may e'er reveal,\r\n  Nor any sign declare\r\n  What in my heart is pent\r\n  Nay, might they so, that were I best conceal,\r\n  Whereof were others ware,\r\n  'Twould serve but to torment\r\n  Me, whose is such content,\r\n  That weak were words and all inadequate\r\n  A tittle of my bliss to adumbrate.\r\n\r\nWho would have dreamed that e'er in mine embrace\r\n  Her I should clip and fold\r\n  Whom there I still do feel,\r\n  Or as 'gainst her face e'er to lay my face\r\n  Attain such grace untold,\r\n  And unimagined weal?\r\n  Wherefore my bliss I seal\r\n  Of mine own heart within the circuit strait,\r\n  And still in thy sweet flame luxuriate.\r\n\r\nSo ended Pamfilo his song: whereto all the company responded in full\r\nchorus; nor was there any but gave to its words an inordinate degree of\r\nattention, endeavouring by conjecture to penetrate that which he\r\nintimated that 'twas meet he should keep secret. Divers were the\r\ninterpretations hazarded, but all were wide of the mark. At length,\r\nhowever, the queen, seeing that ladies and men alike were fain of rest,\r\nbade all betake them to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nEndeth here the eighth day of the Decameron, beginneth the ninth, in\r\nwhich, under the rule of Emilia, discourse is had, at the discretion of\r\neach, of such matters as most commend themselves to each in turn.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe luminary, before whose splendour the night takes wing, had already\r\nchanged the eighth heaven(1) from azure to the lighter blue,(2) and in\r\nthe meads the flowerets were beginning to lift their heads, when Emilia,\r\nbeing risen, roused her fair gossips, and, likewise, the young men. And\r\nso the queen leading the way at an easy pace, and the rest of the company\r\nfollowing, they hied them to a copse at no great distance from the\r\npalace. Where, being entered, they saw the goats and stags and other wild\r\ncreatures, as if witting that in this time of pestilence they had nought\r\nto fear from the hunter, stand awaiting them with no more sign of fear\r\nthan if they had been tamed: and so, making now towards this, now towards\r\nthe other of them as if to touch them, they diverted themselves for a\r\nwhile by making them skip and run. But, as soon as the sun was in the\r\nascendant, by common consent they turned back, and whoso met them,\r\ngarlanded as they were with oak-leaves, and carrying store of fragrant\r\nherbs or flowers in their hands might well have said:--\"Either shall\r\ndeath not vanquish these, or they will meet it with a light heart.\" So,\r\nslowly wended they their way, now singing, now bandying quips and merry\r\njests, to the palace, where they found all things in order meet, and\r\ntheir servants in blithe and merry cheer. A while they rested, nor went\r\nthey to table until six ditties, each gayer than that which went before,\r\nhad been sung by the young men and the ladies; which done, they washed\r\ntheir hands, and all by the queen's command were ranged by the seneschal\r\nat the table; and, the viands being served, they cheerily took their\r\nmeal: wherefrom being risen, they trod some measures to the accompaniment\r\nof music; and then, by the queen's command, whoso would betook him to\r\nrest. However, the accustomed hour being come, they all gathered at the\r\nwonted spot for their discoursing, and the queen, bending her regard upon\r\nFilomena, bade her make a beginning of the day's story-telling, which she\r\nwith a smile did on this wise:--\r\n\r\n(1) I.e. in the Ptolemaic system, the region of the fixed stars.\r\n\r\n(2) Cilestro: a word for which we have no exact equivalent, the dominant\r\nnote of the Italian sky, when the sun is well up, being its intense\r\nluminosity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL I.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMadonna Francesca, having two lovers, the one Rinuccio, the other\r\nAlessandro, by name, and loving neither of them, induces the one to\r\nsimulate a corpse in a tomb, and the other to enter the tomb to fetch him\r\nout: whereby, neither satisfying her demands, she artfully rids herself\r\nof both.\r\n--\r\n\r\nMadam, since so it pleases you, well pleased am I that in this vast, this\r\nboundless field of discourse, which you, our Lady Bountiful, have\r\nfurnished us withal, 'tis mine to run the first course; wherein if I do\r\nwell, I doubt not that those, who shall follow me, will do not only well\r\nbut better. Such, sweet my ladies, has been the tenor of our discourse,\r\nthat times not a few the might of Love, how great and singular it is, has\r\nbeen set forth, but yet I doubt the topic is not exhausted, nor would it\r\nbe so, though we should continue to speak of nought else for the space of\r\na full year. And as Love not only leads lovers to debate with themselves\r\nwhether they were not best to die, but also draws them into the houses of\r\nthe dead in quest of the dead, I am minded in this regard to tell you a\r\nstory, wherein you will not only discern the power of Love, but will also\r\nlearn how the ready wit of a worthy lady enabled her to disembarrass\r\nherself of two lovers, whose love was displeasing to her.\r\n\r\nKnow, then, that there dwelt aforetime in the city of Pistoia a most\r\nbeauteous widow lady, of whom it so befell that two of our citizens, the\r\none Rinuccio Palermini, the other Alessandro Chiarmontesi, by name,\r\ntarrying at Pistoia, for that they were banished from Florence, became,\r\nneither witting how it stood with the other, in the last degree\r\nenamoured. Wherefore each used all his arts to win the love of Madonna\r\nFrancesca de' Lazzari--such was the lady's name--and she, being thus\r\ncontinually plied with ambassages and entreaties on the part of both, and\r\nhaving indiscreetly lent ear to them from time to time, found it no easy\r\nmatter discreetly to extricate herself, when she was minded to be rid of\r\ntheir pestering, until it occurred to her to adopt the following\r\nexpedient, to wit, to require of each a service, such as, though not\r\nimpracticable, she deemed none would actually perform, to the end that,\r\nthey making default, she might have a decent and colourable pretext for\r\nrefusing any longer to receive their ambassages. Which expedient was on\r\nthis wise. One day there died in Pistoia, and was buried in a tomb\r\noutside the church of the Friars Minors, a man, who, though his forbears\r\nhad been gentlefolk, was reputed the very worst man, not in Pistoia only,\r\nbut in all the world, and therewithal he was of form and feature so\r\npreternaturally hideous that whoso knew him not could scarce see him for\r\nthe first time without a shudder. Now, the lady pondering her design on\r\nthe day of this man's death, it occurred to her that he might in a\r\nmeasure subserve its accomplishment: wherefore she said to her\r\nmaid:--\"Thou knowest to what worry and annoyance I am daily put by the\r\nambassages of these two Florentines, Rinuccio, and Alessandro. Now I am\r\nnot disposed to gratify either of them with my love, and therefore, to\r\nshake them off, I am minded, as they make such great protestations, to\r\nput them to the proof by requiring of each something which I am sure he\r\nwill not perform, and thus to rid myself of their pestering: so list what\r\nI mean to do. Thou knowest that this morning there was interred in the\r\nground of the Friars Minors this Scannadio (such was the name of the bad\r\nman of whom we spoke but now) whose aspect, while he yet lived, appalled\r\neven the bravest among us. Thou wilt therefore go privily, to Alessandro,\r\nand say to him:--'Madonna Francesca sends thee word by me that the time\r\nis now come when thou mayst win that which thou hast so much desired, to\r\nwit, her love and joyance thereof, if thou be so minded, on the following\r\nterms. For a reason, which thou shalt learn hereafter, one of her kinsmen\r\nis to bring home to her to-night the corpse of Scannadio, who was buried\r\nthis morning; and she, standing in mortal dread of this dead man, would\r\nfain not see him; wherefore she prays thee to do her a great service, and\r\nbe so good as to get thee this evening at the hour of first sleep to the\r\ntomb wherein Scannadio is buried, and go in, and having wrapped thyself\r\nin his grave-clothes, lie there, as thou wert Scannadio, himself, until\r\none come for thee, when thou must say never a word, but let him carry\r\nthee forth, and bear thee to Madonna Francesca's house, where she will\r\ngive thee welcome, and let thee stay with her, until thou art minded to\r\ndepart, and, for the rest, thou wilt leave it to her.' And if he says\r\nthat he will gladly do so, well and good; if not, then thou wilt tell him\r\nfrom me, never more to shew himself where I am, and, as he values his\r\nlife, to have a care to send me no more ambassages. Which done, thou wilt\r\ngo to Rinuccio Palermini, and wilt say to him:--'Madonna Francesca lets\r\nthee know that she is ready in all respects to comply with thy wishes, so\r\nthou wilt do her a great service, which is on this wise: to-night, about\r\nmidnight, thou must go to the tomb wherein was this morning interred\r\nScannadio, and saying never a word, whatever thou mayst hear or otherwise\r\nbe ware of, bear him gently forth to Madonna Francesca's house, where\r\nthou shalt learn wherefore she requires this of thee, and shalt have thy\r\nsolace of her; and if thou art not minded to obey her in this, see that\r\nthou never more send her ambassage.'\"\r\n\r\nThe maid did her mistress's errand, omitting nothing, to both the men,\r\nand received from each the same answer, to wit, that to pleasure the\r\nlady, he would adventure a journey to hell, to say nothing of entering a\r\ntomb. With which answer the maid returned to the lady, who waited to see\r\nif they would be such fools as to make it good. Night came, and at the\r\nhour of first sleep Alessandro Chiarmontesi, stripped to his doublet,\r\nquitted his house, and bent his steps towards Scannadio's tomb, with\r\nintent there to take the dead man's place. As he walked, there came upon\r\nhim a great fear, and he fell a saying to himself:--Ah! what a fool am I!\r\nWhither go I? How know I that her kinsmen, having detected my love, and\r\nsurmising that which is not, have not put her upon requiring this of me,\r\nin order that they may slay me in the tomb? In which event I alone should\r\nbe the loser, for nought would ever be heard of it, so that they would\r\nescape scot-free. Or how know I but that 'tis some machination of one of\r\nmy ill-wishers, whom perchance she loves, and is therefore minded to\r\nabet? And again quoth he to himself:--But allowing that 'tis neither the\r\none nor the other, and that her kinsmen are really to carry me to her\r\nhouse, I scarce believe that 'tis either that they would fain embrace\r\nScannadio's corpse themselves, or let her do so: rather it must be that\r\nthey have a mind to perpetrate some outrage upon it, for that, perchance,\r\nhe once did them an evil turn. She bids me say never a word, no matter\r\nwhat I may hear or be otherwise ware of. Suppose they were to pluck out\r\nmy eyes, or my teeth, or cut off my hands, or treat me to some other\r\nhorse-play of the like sort, how then? how could I keep quiet? And if I\r\nopen my mouth, they will either recognize me, and perchance do me a\r\nmischief, or, if they spare me, I shall have been at pains for nought,\r\nfor they will not leave me with the lady, and she will say that I\r\ndisobeyed her command, and I shall never have aught of her favours.\r\n\r\nAs thus he communed with himself, he was on the point of turning back;\r\nbut his overmastering love plied him with opposing arguments of such\r\nforce that he kept on his way, and reached the tomb; which having opened,\r\nhe entered, and after stripping Scannadio, and wrapping himself in the\r\ngrave-clothes, closed it, and laid himself down in Scannadio's place. He\r\nthen fell a thinking of the dead man, and his manner of life, and the\r\nthings which he had heard tell of as happening by night, and in other\r\nless appalling places than the houses of the dead; whereby all the hairs\r\nof his head stood on end, and he momently expected Scannadio to rise and\r\ncut his throat. However, the ardour of his love so fortified him that he\r\novercame these and all other timorous apprehensions, and lay as if he\r\nwere dead, awaiting what should betide him.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight Rinuccio, bent likewise upon fulfilling his lady's\r\nbehest, sallied forth of his house, revolving as he went divers\r\nforebodings of possible contingencies, as that, having Scannadio's corpse\r\nupon his shoulders, he might fall into the hands of the Signory, and be\r\ncondemned to the fire as a wizard, or that, should the affair get wind,\r\nit might embroil him with his kinsfolk, or the like, which gave him\r\npause. But then with a revulsion of feeling:-- Shall I, quoth he to\r\nhimself, deny this lady, whom I so much have loved and love, the very\r\nfirst thing that she asks of me? And that too when I am thereby to win\r\nher favour? No, though 'twere as much as my life is worth, far be it from\r\nme to fail of keeping my word. So on he fared, and arrived at the tomb,\r\nwhich he had no difficulty in opening, and being entered, laid hold of\r\nAlessandro, who, though in mortal fear, had given no sign of life, by the\r\nfeet, and dragged him forth, and having hoisted him on to his shoulders,\r\nbent his steps towards the lady's house. And as he went, being none too\r\ncareful of Alessandro, he swung him from time to time against one or\r\nother of the angles of certain benches that were by the wayside; and\r\nindeed the night was so dark and murky that he could not see where he was\r\ngoing. And when he was all but on the threshold of the lady's house (she\r\nstanding within at a window with her maid, to mark if Rinuccio would\r\nbring Alessandro, and being already provided with an excuse for sending\r\nthem both away), it so befell that the patrol of the Signory, who were\r\nposted in the street in dead silence, being on the look-out for a certain\r\nbandit, hearing the tramp of Rinuccio's feet, suddenly shewed a light,\r\nthe better to know what was toward, and whither to go, and advancing\r\ntarges and lances, cried out:--\"Who goes there?\" Whereupon Rinuccio,\r\nhaving little leisure for deliberation, let Alessandro fall, and took to\r\nflight as fast as his legs might carry him. Alessandro, albeit encumbered\r\nby the graveclothes, which were very long, also jumped up and made off.\r\nBy the light shewn by the patrol the lady had very plainly perceived\r\nRinuccio, with Alessandro on his back, as also that Alessandro had the\r\ngrave-clothes upon him; and much did she marvel at the daring of both,\r\nbut, for all that, she laughed heartily to see Rinuccio drop Alessandro,\r\nand Alessandro run away. Overjoyed at the turn the affair had taken, and\r\npraising God that He had rid her of their harass, she withdrew from the\r\nwindow, and betook her to her chamber, averring to her maid that for\r\ncertain they must both be mightily in love with her, seeing that 'twas\r\nplain they had both done her bidding.\r\n\r\nCrestfallen and cursing his evil fortune, Rinuccio nevertheless went not\r\nhome, but, as soon as the street was clear of the patrol, came back to\r\nthe spot where he had dropped Alessandro, and stooped down and began\r\nfeeling about, if haply he might find him, and so do his devoir to the\r\nlady; but, as he found him not, he supposed the patrol must have borne\r\nhim thence, and so at last home he went; as did also Alessandro, knowing\r\nnot what else to do, and deploring his mishap. On the morrow, Scannadio's\r\ntomb being found open and empty, for Alessandro had thrown the corpse\r\ninto the vault below, all Pistoia debated of the matter with no small\r\ndiversity of opinion, the fools believing that Scannadio had been carried\r\noff by devils. Neither of the lovers, however, forbore to make suit to\r\nthe lady for her favour and love, telling her what he had done, and what\r\nhad happened, and praying her to have him excused that he had not\r\nperfectly carried out her instructions. But she, feigning to believe\r\nneither of them, disposed of each with the same curt answer, to wit,\r\nthat, as he had not done her bidding, she would never do aught for him.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL II.\r\n\r\n--\r\nAn abbess rises in haste and in the dark, with intent to surprise an\r\naccused nun abed with her lover: thinking to put on her veil, she puts on\r\ninstead the breeches of a priest that she has with her: the nun, espying\r\nher headgear, and doing her to wit thereof, is acquitted, and thenceforth\r\nfinds it easier to forgather with her lover.\r\n--\r\n\r\nSo ended Filomena; and when all had commended the address shewn by the\r\nlady in ridding herself of the two lovers that she affected not, and\r\ncontrariwise had censured the hardihood of the two lovers as not love but\r\nmadness, the queen turned to Elisa, and with a charming air:--\"Now,\r\nElisa, follow,\" quoth she: whereupon Elisa began on this wise:--Dearest\r\nladies, 'twas cleverly done of Madonna Francesca, to disembarrass herself\r\nin the way we have heard: but I have to tell of a young nun, who by a\r\nhappy retort, and the favour of Fortune, delivered herself from imminent\r\nperil. And as you know that there are not a few most foolish folk, who,\r\nnotwithstanding their folly, take upon themselves the governance and\r\ncorrection of others; so you may learn from my story that Fortune at\r\ntimes justly puts them to shame; which befell the abbess, who was the\r\nsuperior of the nun of whom I am about to speak.\r\n\r\nYou are to know, then, that in a convent in Lombardy of very great repute\r\nfor strict and holy living there was, among other ladies that there wore\r\nthe veil, a young woman of noble family, and extraordinary beauty. Now\r\nIsabetta--for such was her name--having speech one day of one of her\r\nkinsmen at the grate, became enamoured of a fine young gallant that was\r\nwith him; who, seeing her to be very fair, and reading her passion in her\r\neyes, was kindled with a like flame for her: which mutual and unsolaced\r\nlove they bore a great while not without great suffering to both. But at\r\nlength, both being intent thereon, the gallant discovered a way by which\r\nhe might with all secrecy visit his nun; and she approving, he paid her\r\nnot one visit only, but many, to their no small mutual solace. But, while\r\nthus they continued their intercourse, it so befell that one night one of\r\nthe sisters observed him take his leave of Isabetta and depart, albeit\r\nneither he nor she was ware that they had thus been discovered. The\r\nsister imparted what she had seen to several others. At first they were\r\nminded to denounce her to the abbess, one Madonna Usimbalda, who was\r\nreputed by the nuns, and indeed by all that knew her, to be a good and\r\nholy woman; but on second thoughts they deemed it expedient, that there\r\nmight be no room for denial, to cause the abbess to take her and the\r\ngallant in the act. So they held their peace, and arranged between them\r\nto keep her in watch and close espial, that they might catch her\r\nunawares. Of which practice Isabetta recking, witting nought, it so\r\nbefell that one night, when she had her lover to see her, the sisters\r\nthat were on the watch were soon ware of it, and at what they deemed the\r\nnick of time parted into two companies of which one mounted guard at the\r\nthreshold of Isabetta's cell, while the other hasted to the abbess's\r\nchamber, and knocking at the door, roused her, and as soon as they heard\r\nher voice, said:--\"Up, Madam, without delay: we have discovered that\r\nIsabetta has a young man with her in her cell.\"\r\n\r\nNow that night the abbess had with her a priest whom she used not seldom\r\nto have conveyed to her in a chest; and the report of the sisters making\r\nher apprehensive lest for excess of zeal and hurry they should force the\r\ndoor open, she rose in a trice; and huddling on her clothes as best she\r\nmight in the dark, instead of the veil that they wear, which they call\r\nthe psalter, she caught up the priest's breeches, and having clapped them\r\non her head, hied her forth, and locked the door behind her,\r\nsaying:--\"Where is this woman accursed of God?\" And so, guided by the\r\nsisters, all so agog to catch Isabetta a sinning that they perceived not\r\nwhat manner of headgear the abbess wore, she made her way to the cell,\r\nand with their aid broke open the door; and entering they found the two\r\nlovers abed in one another's arms; who, as it were, thunderstruck to be\r\nthus surprised, lay there, witting not what to do. The sisters took the\r\nyoung nun forthwith, and by command of the abbess brought her to the\r\nchapter-house. The gallant, left behind in the cell, put on his clothes\r\nand waited to see how the affair would end, being minded to make as many\r\nnuns as he might come at pay dearly for any despite that might be done\r\nhis mistress, and to bring her off with him. The abbess, seated in the\r\nchapter-house with all her nuns about her, and all eyes bent upon the\r\nculprit, began giving her the severest reprimand that ever woman got, for\r\nthat by her disgraceful and abominable conduct, should it get wind, she\r\nhad sullied the fair fame of the convent; whereto she added menaces most\r\ndire. Shamefast and timorous, the culprit essayed no defence, and her\r\nsilence begat pity of her in the rest; but, while the abbess waxed more\r\nand more voluble, it chanced that the girl raised her head and espied the\r\nabbess's headgear, and the points that hung down on this side and that.\r\nThe significance whereof being by no means lost upon her, she quite\r\nplucked up heart, and:--\"Madam,\" quoth she, \"so help you God, tie up your\r\ncoif, and then you may say what you will to me.\" Whereto the abbess, not\r\nunderstanding her, replied:--\"What coif, lewd woman? So thou hast the\r\neffrontery to jest! Think'st thou that what thou hast done is a matter\r\nmeet for jests?\" Whereupon:--\"Madam,\" quoth the girl again, \"I pray you,\r\ntie up your coif, and then you may say to me whatever you please.\" Which\r\noccasioned not a few of the nuns to look up at the abbess's head, and the\r\nabbess herself to raise her hands thereto, and so she and they at one and\r\nthe same time apprehended Isabetta's meaning. Wherefore the abbess,\r\nfinding herself detected by all in the same sin, and that no disguise was\r\npossible, changed her tone, and held quite another sort of language than\r\nbefore, the upshot of which was that 'twas impossible to withstand the\r\nassaults of the flesh, and that, accordingly, observing due secrecy as\r\ntheretofore, all might give themselves a good time, as they had\r\nopportunity. So, having dismissed Isabetta to rejoin her lover in her\r\ncell, she herself returned to lie with her priest. And many a time\r\nthereafter, in spite of the envious, Isabetta had her gallant to see her,\r\nthe others, that lacked lovers, doing in secret the best they might to\r\npush their fortunes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL III.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMaster Simone, at the instance of Bruno and Buffalmacco and Nello, makes\r\nCalandrino believe that he is with child. Calandrino, accordingly, gives\r\nthem capons and money for medicines, and is cured without being\r\ndelivered.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen Elisa had ended her story, and all had given thanks to God that He\r\nhad vouchsafed the young nun a happy escape from the fangs of her envious\r\ncompanions, the queen bade Filostrato follow suit; and without expecting\r\na second command, thus Filostrato began:--Fairest my ladies, the uncouth\r\njudge from the Marches, of whom I told you yesterday, took from the tip\r\nof my tongue a story of Calandrino, which I was on the point of\r\nnarrating: and as nought can be said of him without mightily enhancing\r\nour jollity, albeit not a little has already been said touching him and\r\nhis comrades, I will now give you the story which I had meant yesterday\r\nto give you. Who they were, this Calandrino and the others that I am to\r\ntell of in this story, has already been sufficiently explained;\r\nwherefore, without more ado, I say that one of Calandrino's aunts having\r\ndied, leaving him two hundred pounds in petty cash, Calandrino gave out\r\nthat he was minded to purchase an estate, and, as if he had had ten\r\nthousand florins of gold to invest, engaged every broker in Florence to\r\ntreat for him, the negotiation always falling through, as soon as the\r\nprice was named. Bruno and Buffalmacco, knowing what was afoot, told him\r\nagain and again that he had better give himself a jolly time with them\r\nthan go about buying earth as if he must needs make pellets;(1) but so\r\nfar were they from effecting their purpose, that they could not even\r\nprevail upon him to give them a single meal. Whereat as one day they\r\ngrumbled, being joined by a comrade of theirs, one Nello, also a painter,\r\nthey all three took counsel how they might wet their whistle at\r\nCalandrino's expense; and, their plan being soon concerted, the next\r\nmorning Calandrino was scarce gone out, when Nello met him,\r\nsaying:--\"Good day, Calandrino:\" whereto Calandrino replied:--\"God give\r\nthee a good day and a good year.\" Nello then drew back a little, and\r\nlooked him steadily in the face, until:--\"What seest thou to stare at?\"\r\nquoth Calandrino. \"Hadst thou no pain in the night?\" returned Nello;\r\n\"thou seemest not thyself to me.\" Which Calandrino no sooner heard, than\r\nhe began to be disquieted, and:--\"Alas! How sayst thou?\" quoth he. \"What\r\ntak'st thou to be the matter with me?\" \"Why, as to that I have nothing to\r\nsay,\" returned Nello; \"but thou seemest to be quite changed: perchance\r\n'tis not what I suppose;\" and with that he left him.\r\n\r\nCalandrino, anxious, though he could not in the least have said why, went\r\non; and soon Buffalmacco, who was not far off, and had observed him part\r\nfrom Nello, made up to him, and greeted him, asking him if he was not in\r\npain. \"I cannot say,\" replied Calandrino; \"'twas but now that Nello told\r\nme that I looked quite changed: can it be that there is aught the matter\r\nwith me?\" \"Aught?\" quoth Buffalmacco, \"ay, indeed, there might be a\r\ntrifle the matter with thee. Thou look'st to be half dead, man.\"\r\nCalandrino now began to think he must have a fever. And then up came\r\nBruno; and the first thing he said was:--\"Why, Calandrino, how ill thou\r\nlook'st! thy appearance is that of a corpse. How dost thou feel?\" To be\r\nthus accosted by all three left no doubt in Calandrino's mind that he was\r\nill, and so:--\"What shall I do?\" quoth he, in a great fright. \"My\r\nadvice,\" replied Bruno, \"is that thou go home and get thee to bed and\r\ncover thee well up, and send thy water to Master Simone, who, as thou\r\nknowest, is such a friend of ours. He will tell thee at once what thou\r\nmust do; and we will come to see thee, and will do aught that may be\r\nneedful.\" And Nello then joining them, they all three went home with\r\nCalandrino, who, now quite spent, went straight to his room, and said to\r\nhis wife:--\"Come now, wrap me well up; I feel very ill.\" And so he laid\r\nhimself on the bed, and sent a maid with his water to Master Simone, who\r\nhad then his shop in the Mercato Vecchio, at the sign of the pumpkin.\r\nWhereupon quoth Bruno to his comrades:--\"You will stay here with him, and\r\nI will go hear what the doctor has to say, and if need be, will bring him\r\nhither.\" \"Prithee, do so, my friend,\" quoth Calandrino, \"and bring me\r\nword how it is with me, for I feel as how I cannot say in my inside.\" So\r\nBruno hied him to Master Simone, and before the maid arrived with the\r\nwater, told him what was afoot. The Master, thus primed, inspected the\r\nwater, and then said to the maid:--\"Go tell Calandrino to keep himself\r\nvery warm, and I will come at once, and let him know what is the matter\r\nwith him, and what he must do.\" With which message the maid was scarce\r\nreturned, when the Master and Bruno arrived, and the Master, having\r\nseated himself beside Calandrino, felt his pulse, and by and by, in the\r\npresence of his wife, said:--\"Harkye, Calandrino, I speak to thee as a\r\nfriend, and I tell thee that what is amiss with thee is just that thou\r\nart with child.\" Whereupon Calandrino cried out querulously:--\"Woe's me!\r\n'Tis thy doing, Tessa, for that thou must needs be uppermost: I told thee\r\nplainly what would come of it,\" Whereat the lady, being not a little\r\nmodest, coloured from brow to neck, and with downcast eyes, withdrew from\r\nthe room, saying never a word by way of answer. Calandrino ran on in the\r\nsame plaintive strain:--\"Alas! woe's me! What shall I do? How shall I be\r\ndelivered of this child? What passage can it find? Ah! I see only too\r\nplainly that the lasciviousness of this wife of mine has been the death\r\nof me: God make her as wretched as I would fain be happy! Were I as well\r\nas I am not, I would get me up and thrash her, till I left not a whole\r\nbone in her body, albeit it does but serve me right for letting her get\r\nthe upper place; but if I do win through this, she shall never have it\r\nagain; verily she might pine to death for it, but she should not have\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nWhich to hear, Bruno and Buffalmacco and Nello were like to burst with\r\nsuppressed laughter, and Master Scimmione(2) laughed so frantically, that\r\nall his teeth were ready to start from his jaws. However, at length, in\r\nanswer to Calandrino's appeals and entreaties for counsel and\r\nsuccour:--\"Calandrino,\" quoth the Master, \"thou mayst dismiss thy fears,\r\nfor, God be praised, we were apprised of thy state in such good time that\r\nwith but little trouble, in the course of a few days, I shall set thee\r\nright; but 'twill cost a little.\" \"Woe's me,\" returned Calandrino, \"be it\r\nso, Master, for the love of God: I have here two hundred pounds, with\r\nwhich I had thoughts of buying an estate: take them all, all, if you must\r\nhave all, so only I may escape being delivered, for I know not how I\r\nshould manage it, seeing that women, albeit 'tis much easier for them, do\r\nmake such a noise in the hour of their labour, that I misdoubt me, if I\r\nsuffered so, I should die before I was delivered.\" \"Disquiet not\r\nthyself,\" said the doctor: \"I will have a potion distilled for thee; of\r\nrare virtue it is, and not a little palatable, and in the course of three\r\ndays 'twill purge thee of all, and leave thee in better fettle than a\r\nfish; but thou wilt do well to be careful thereafter, and commit no such\r\nindiscretions again. Now to make this potion we must have three pair of\r\ngood fat capons, and, for divers other ingredients, thou wilt give one of\r\nthy friends here five pounds in small change to purchase them, and thou\r\nwilt have everything sent to my shop, and so, please God, I will send\r\nthee this distilled potion to-morrow morning, and thou wilt take a good\r\nbeakerful each time.\" Whereupon:--\"Be it as you bid, Master mine,\" quoth\r\nCalandrino, and handing Bruno five pounds, and money enough to purchase\r\nthree pair of capons, he begged him, if it were not too much trouble, to\r\ndo him the service to buy these things for him. So away went the doctor,\r\nand made a little decoction by way of draught, and sent it him. Bruno\r\nbought the capons and all else that was needed to furnish forth the\r\nfeast, with which he and his comrades and the doctor regaled them.\r\nCalandrino drank of the decoction for three mornings, after which he had\r\na visit from his friends and the doctor, who felt his pulse, and\r\nthen:--\"Beyond a doubt, Calandrino,\" quoth he, \"thou art cured, and so\r\nthou hast no more occasion to keep indoors, but needst have no fear to do\r\nwhatever thou hast a mind to.\" Much relieved, Calandrino got up, and\r\nresumed his accustomed way of life, and, wherever he found any one to\r\ntalk to, was loud in praise of Master Simone for the excellent manner in\r\nwhich he had cured him, causing him in three days without the least\r\nsuffering to be quit of his pregnancy. And Bruno and Buffalmacco and\r\nNello were not a little pleased with themselves that they had so cleverly\r\ngot the better of Calandrino's niggardliness, albeit Monna Tessa, who was\r\nnot deceived, murmured not a little against her husband.\r\n\r\n(1) I.e. bolts of clay for the cross-bow.\r\n\r\n(2) I.e. great ape: with a play on Simone.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IV.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCecco, son of Messer Fortarrigo, loses his all at play at Buonconvento,\r\nbesides the money of Cecco, son of Messer Angiulieri; whom, running after\r\nhim in his shirt and crying out that he has robbed him, he causes to be\r\ntaken by peasants: he then puts on his clothes, mounts his palfrey, and\r\nleaves him to follow in his shirt.\r\n--\r\n\r\nAll the company laughed beyond measure to hear what Calandrino said\r\ntouching his wife: but, when Filostrato had done, Neifile, being bidden\r\nby the queen, thus began:--Noble ladies, were it not more difficult for\r\nmen to evince their good sense and virtue than their folly and their\r\nvice, many would labour in vain to set bounds to their flow of words:\r\nwhereof you have had a most conspicuous example in poor blundering\r\nCalandrino, who, for the better cure of that with which in his simplicity\r\nhe supposed himself to be afflicted, had no sort of need to discover in\r\npublic his wife's secret pleasures. Which affair has brought to my mind\r\none that fell out contrariwise, inasmuch as the guile of one discomfited\r\nthe good sense of another to the grievous loss and shame of the\r\ndiscomfited: the manner whereof I am minded to relate to you.\r\n\r\n'Tis not many years since there were in Siena two young men, both of age,\r\nand both alike named Cecco, the one being son of Messer Angiulieri, the\r\nother of Messer Fortarrigo. Who, albeit in many other respects their\r\ndispositions accorded ill, agreed so well in one, to wit, that they both\r\nhated their fathers, that they became friends, and kept much together.\r\nNow Angiulieri, being a pretty fellow, and well-mannered, could not brook\r\nto live at Siena on the allowance made him by his father, and learning\r\nthat there was come into the March of Ancona, as legate of the Pope, a\r\ncardinal, to whom he was much bounden, resolved to resort to him there,\r\nthinking thereby to improve his circumstances. So, having acquainted his\r\nfather with his purpose, he prevailed upon him to give him there and then\r\nall that he would have given him during the next six months, that he\r\nmight have the wherewith to furnish himself with apparel and a good\r\nmount, so as to travel in a becoming manner. And as he was looking out\r\nfor some one to attend him as his servant, Fortarrigo, hearing of it,\r\ncame presently to him and besought him with all earnestness to take him\r\nwith him as his groom, or servant, or what he would, and he would be\r\nsatisfied with his keep, without any salary whatsoever. Whereto\r\nAngiulieri made answer that he was not disposed to take him, not but that\r\nhe well knew that he was competent for any service that might be required\r\nof him, but because he was given to play, and therewithal would at times\r\nget drunk. Fortarrigo assured him with many an oath that he would be on\r\nhis guard to commit neither fault, and added thereto such instant\r\nentreaties, that Angiulieri was, as it were, vanquished, and consented.\r\nSo one morning they took the road for Buonconvento, being minded there to\r\nbreakfast. Now when Angiulieri had breakfasted, as 'twas a very hot day,\r\nhe had a bed made in the inn, and having undressed with Fortarrigo's\r\nhelp, he composed himself to sleep, telling Fortarrigo to call him on the\r\nstroke of none. Angiulieri thus sleeping, Fortarrigo repaired to the\r\ntavern, where, having slaked his thirst, he sate down to a game with some\r\nthat were there, who speedily won from him all his money, and thereafter\r\nin like manner all the clothes he had on his back: wherefore he, being\r\nanxious to retrieve his losses, went, stripped as he was to his shirt, to\r\nthe room where lay Angiulieri; and seeing that he was sound asleep, he\r\ntook from his purse all the money that he had, and so went back to the\r\ngaming-table, and staked it, and lost it all, as he had his own.\r\n\r\nBy and by Angiulieri awoke, and got up, and dressed, and called for\r\nFortarrigo; and as Fortarrigo answered not, he supposed that he must have\r\nhad too much to drink, and be sleeping it off somewhere, as was his wont.\r\nHe accordingly determined to leave him alone; and doubting not to find a\r\nbetter servant at Corsignano, he let saddle his palfrey and attach the\r\nvalise; but when, being about to depart, he would have paid the host,\r\nnever a coin could he come by. Whereat there was no small stir, so that\r\nall the inn was in an uproar, Angiulieri averring that he had been robbed\r\nin the house, and threatening to have them all arrested and taken to\r\nSiena; when, lo, who should make his appearance but Fortarrigo in his\r\nshirt, intent now to steal the clothes, as he had stolen the moneys, of\r\nAngiulieri? And marking that Angiulieri was accoutred for the road:--\"How\r\nis this, Angiulieri?\" quoth he. \"Are we to start so soon? Nay, but wait a\r\nlittle. One will be here presently that has my doublet in pawn for\r\nthirty-eight soldi; I doubt not he will return it me for thirty-five\r\nsoldi, if I pay money down.\" And while they were yet talking, in came one\r\nthat made it plain to Angiulieri that 'twas Fortarrigo that had robbed\r\nhim of his money, for he told him the amount that Fortarrigo had lost.\r\nWhereat Angiulieri, in a towering passion, rated Fortarrigo right\r\nsoundly, and, but that he stood more in fear of man than of God, would\r\nhave suited action to word; and so, threatening to have him hanged by the\r\nneck and proclaimed an outlaw at the gallows-tree of Siena, he mounted\r\nhis horse.\r\n\r\nFortarrigo, making as if 'twas not to him, but to another, that\r\nAngiulieri thus spoke, made answer:--\"Come now, Angiulieri, we were best\r\nhave done with all this idle talk, and consider the matter of substance:\r\nwe can redeem for thirty-five soldi, if we pay forthwith, but if we wait\r\ntill to-morrow, we shall not get off with less than thirty-eight, the\r\nfull amount of the loan; and 'tis because I staked by his advice that he\r\nwill make me this allowance. Now why should not we save these three\r\nsoldi?\" Whereat Angiulieri waxed well-nigh desperate, more particularly\r\nthat he marked that the bystanders were scanning him suspiciously, as if,\r\nso far from understanding that Fortarrigo had staked and lost his,\r\nAngiulieri's money, they gave him credit for still being in funds: so he\r\ncried out:--\"What have I to do with thy doublet? 'Tis high time thou wast\r\nhanged by the neck, that, not content with robbing me and gambling away\r\nmy money, thou must needs also keep me in parley here and make mock of\r\nme, when I would fain be gone.\" Fortarrigo, however, still persisted in\r\nmaking believe that Angiulieri did not mean this for him, and only\r\nsaid:--\"Nay, but why wilt not thou save me these three soldi? Think'st\r\nthou I can be of no more use to thee? Prithee, an thou lov'st me, do me\r\nthis turn. Wherefore in such a hurry? We have time enough to get to\r\nTorrenieri this evening. Come now, out with thy purse. Thou knowest I\r\nmight search Siena through, and not find a doublet that would suit me so\r\nwell as this: and for all I let him have it for thirty-eight soldi, 'tis\r\nworth forty or more; so thou wilt wrong me twice over.\" Vexed beyond\r\nmeasure that, after robbing him, Fortarrigo should now keep him clavering\r\nabout the matter, Angiulieri made no answer, but turned his horse's head,\r\nand took the road for Torrenieri. But Fortarrigo with cunning malice\r\ntrotted after him in his shirt, and 'twas still his doublet, his doublet,\r\nthat he would have of him: and when they had thus ridden two good miles,\r\nand Angiulieri was forcing the pace to get out of earshot of his\r\npestering, Fortarrigo espied some husbandmen in a field beside the road a\r\nlittle ahead of Angiulieri, and fell a shouting to them amain:--\"Take\r\nthief! take thief!\" Whereupon they came up with their spades and their\r\nmattocks, and barred Angiulieri's way, supposing that he must have robbed\r\nthe man that came shouting after him in his shirt, and stopped him and\r\napprehended him; and little indeed did it avail him to tell them who he\r\nwas, and how the matter stood. For up came Fortarrigo with a wrathful\r\nair, and:--\"I know not,\" quoth he, \"why I spare to kill thee on the spot,\r\ntraitor, thief that thou art, thus to despoil me and give me the slip!\"\r\nAnd then, turning to the peasants:--\"You see, gentlemen,\" quoth he, \"in\r\nwhat a trim he left me in the inn, after gambling away all that he had\r\nwith him and on him. Well indeed may I say that under God 'tis to you I\r\nowe it that I have thus come by my own again: for which cause I shall\r\never be beholden to you.\" Angiulieri also had his say; but his words\r\npassed unheeded. Fortarrigo with the help of the peasants compelled him\r\nto dismount; and having stripped him, donned his clothes, mounted his\r\nhorse, and leaving him barefoot and in his shirt, rode back to Siena,\r\ngiving out on all hands that he had won the palfrey and the clothes from\r\nAngiulieri. So Angiulieri, having thought to present himself to the\r\ncardinal in the March a wealthy man, returned to Buonconvento poor and in\r\nhis shirt; and being ashamed for the time to shew himself in Siena,\r\npledged the nag that Fortarrigo had ridden for a suit of clothes, and\r\nbetook him to his kinsfolk at Corsignano, where he tarried, until he\r\nreceived a fresh supply of money from his father. Thus, then,\r\nFortarrigo's guile disconcerted Angiulieri's judicious purpose, albeit\r\nwhen time and occasion served, it was not left unrequited.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL V.\r\n\r\n--\r\nCalandrino being enamoured of a damsel, Bruno gives him a scroll,\r\naverring that, if he but touch her therewith, she will go with him: he is\r\nfound with her by his wife who subjects him to a most severe and\r\nvexatious examination.\r\n--\r\n\r\nSo, at no great length, ended Neifile her story, which the company\r\nallowed to pass with none too much laughter or remark: whereupon the\r\nqueen, turning to Fiammetta, bade her follow suit. Fiammetta, with mien\r\nmost gladsome, made answer that she willingly obeyed, and thus began:--As\r\nI doubt not, ye know, ladies most debonair, be the topic of discourse\r\nnever so well worn, it will still continue to please, if the speaker\r\nknows how to make due choice of time and occasion meet. Wherefore,\r\nconsidering the reason for which we are here (how that 'tis to make merry\r\nand speed the time gaily, and that merely), I deem that there is nought\r\nthat may afford us mirth and solace but here may find time and occasion\r\nmeet, and, after serving a thousand turns of discourse, should still\r\nprove not unpleasing for another thousand. Wherefore, notwithstanding\r\nthat of Calandrino and his doings not a little has from time to time been\r\nsaid among us, yet, considering that, as a while ago Filostrato observed,\r\nthere is nought that concerns him that is not entertaining, I will make\r\nbold to add to the preceding stories another, which I might well, had I\r\nbeen minded to deviate from the truth, have disguised, and so recounted\r\nit to you, under other names; but as whoso in telling a story diverges\r\nfrom the truth does thereby in no small measure diminish the delight of\r\nhis hearers, I purpose for the reason aforesaid to give you the narrative\r\nin proper form.\r\n\r\nNiccolo Cornacchini, one of our citizens, and a man of wealth, had among\r\nother estates a fine one at Camerata, on which he had a grand house\r\nbuilt, and engaged Bruno and Buffalmacco to paint it throughout; in which\r\ntask, for that 'twas by no means light, they associated with them Nello\r\nand Calandrino, and so set to work. There were a few rooms in the house\r\nprovided with beds and other furniture, and an old female servant lived\r\nthere as caretaker, but otherwise the house was unoccupied, for which\r\ncause Niccolo's son, Filippo, being a young man and a bachelor, was wont\r\nsometimes to bring thither a woman for his pleasure, and after keeping\r\nher there for a few days to escort her thence again. Now on one of these\r\noccasions it befell that he brought thither one Niccolosa, whom a vile\r\nfellow, named Mangione, kept in a house at Camaldoli as a common\r\nprostitute. And a fine piece of flesh she was, and wore fine clothes, and\r\nfor one of her sort, knew how to comport herself becomingly and talk\r\nagreeably.\r\n\r\nNow one day at high noon forth tripped the damsel from her chamber in a\r\nwhite gown, her locks braided about her head, to wash her hands and face\r\nat a well that was in the courtyard of the house, and, while she was so\r\nengaged, it befell that Calandrino came there for water, and greeted her\r\nfamiliarly. Having returned his salutation, she, rather because\r\nCalandrino struck her as something out of the common, than for any other\r\ninterest she felt in him, regarded him attentively. Calandrino did the\r\nlike by her, and being smitten by her beauty, found reasons enough why he\r\nshould not go back to his comrades with the water; but, as he knew not\r\nwho she was, he made not bold to address her. She, upon whom his gaze was\r\nnot lost, being minded to amuse herself at his expense, let her glance\r\nfrom time to time rest upon him, while she heaved a slight sigh or two.\r\nWhereby Calandrino was forthwith captivated, and tarried in the\r\ncourtyard, until Filippo called her back into the chamber. Returned to\r\nhis work, Calandrino sighed like a furnace: which Bruno, who was ever\r\nregardful of his doings for the diversion they afforded him, failed not\r\nto mark, and by and by:--\"What the Devil is amiss with thee, comrade\r\nCalandrino?\" quoth he. \"Thou dost nought but puff and blow.\" \"Comrade,\"\r\nreplied Calandrino, \"I should be in luck, had I but one to help me.\" \"How\r\nso?\" quoth Bruno. \"Why,\" returned Calandrino, \"'tis not to go farther,\r\nbut there is a damsel below, fairer than a lamia, and so mightily in love\r\nwith me that 'twould astonish thee. I observed it but now, when I went to\r\nfetch the water.\" \"Nay, but, Calandrino, make sure she be not Filippo's\r\nwife,\" quoth Bruno. \"I doubt 'tis even so,\" replied Calandrino, \"for he\r\ncalled her and she joined him in the chamber; but what signifies it? I\r\nwould circumvent Christ Himself in such case, not to say Filippo. Of a\r\ntruth, comrade, I tell thee she pleases me I could not say how.\"\r\n\"Comrade,\" returned Bruno, \"I will find out for thee who she is, and if\r\nshe be Filippo's wife, two words from me will make it all straight for\r\nthee, for she is much my friend. But how shall we prevent Buffalmacco\r\nknowing it? I can never have a word with her but he is with me.\" \"As to\r\nBuffalmacco,\" replied Calandrino: \"I care not if he do know it; but let\r\nus make sure that it come not to Nello's ears, for he is of kin to Monna\r\nTessa, and would spoil it all.\" Whereto:--\"Thou art in the right,\"\r\nreturned Bruno.\r\n\r\nNow Bruno knew what the damsel was, for he had seen her arrive, and\r\nmoreover Filippo had told him. So, Calandrino having given over working\r\nfor a while, and betaken him to her, Bruno acquainted Nello and\r\nBuffalmacco with the whole story; and thereupon they privily concerted\r\nhow to entreat him in regard of this love affair. Wherefore, upon his\r\nreturn, quoth Bruno softly:--\"Didst see her?\" \"Ay, woe's me!\" replied\r\nCalandrino: \"she has stricken me to the death.\" Quoth Bruno:--\"I will go\r\nsee if she be the lady I take her to be, and if I find that 'tis so,\r\nleave the rest to me.\" Whereupon down went Bruno, and found Filippo and\r\nthe damsel, and fully apprised them what sort of fellow Calandrino was,\r\nand what he had told them, and concerted with them what each should do\r\nand say, that they might have a merry time together over Calandrino's\r\nlove affair. He then rejoined Calandrino, saying:--\"'Tis the very same;\r\nand therefore the affair needs very delicate handling, for, if Filippo\r\nwere but ware thereof, not all Arno's waters would suffice to cleanse us.\r\nHowever, what should I say to her from thee, if by chance I should get\r\nspeech of her?\" \"I'faith,\" replied Calandrino, \"why, first, first of all,\r\nthou wilt tell her that I wish her a thousand bushels of the good seed of\r\ngeneration, and then that I am her servant, and if she is fain\r\nof--aught--thou tak'st me?\" \"Ay,\" quoth Bruno, \"leave it to me.\"\r\n\r\nSupper-time came; and, the day's work done, they went down into the\r\ncourtyard, Filippo and Niccolosa being there, and there they tarried a\r\nwhile to advance Calandrino's suit. Calandrino's gaze was soon riveted on\r\nNiccolosa, and such and so strange and startling were the gestures that\r\nhe made that they would have given sight to the blind. She on her part\r\nused all her arts to inflame his passion, primed as she had been by\r\nBruno, and diverted beyond measure as she was by Calandrino's antics,\r\nwhile Filippo, Buffalmacco and the rest feigned to be occupied in\r\nconverse, and to see nought of what passed. However, after a while, to\r\nCalandrino's extreme disgust, they took their leave; and as they bent\r\ntheir steps towards Florence:--\"I warrant thee,\" quoth Bruno to\r\nCalandrino, \"she wastes away for thee like ice in the sunlight; by the\r\nbody o' God, if thou wert to bring thy rebeck, and sing her one or two of\r\nthy love-songs, she'd throw herself out of window to be with thee.\" Quoth\r\nCalandrino:--\"Think'st thou, comrade, think'st thou, 'twere well I\r\nbrought it?\" \"Ay, indeed,\" returned Bruno. Whereupon:--\"Ah! comrade,\"\r\nquoth Calandrino, \"so thou wouldst not believe me when I told thee\r\nto-day? Of a truth I perceive there's ne'er another knows so well what he\r\nwould be at as I. Who but I would have known how so soon to win the love\r\nof a lady like that? Lucky indeed might they deem themselves, if they did\r\nit, those young gallants that go about, day and night, up and down, a\r\nstrumming on the one-stringed viol, and would not know how to gather a\r\nhandful of nuts once in a millennium. Mayst thou be by to see when I\r\nbring her the rebeck! thou wilt see fine sport. List well what I say: I\r\nam not so old as I look; and she knows it right well: ay, and anyhow I\r\nwill soon let her know it, when I come to grapple her. By the very body\r\nof Christ I will have such sport with her, that she will follow me as any\r\nlove-sick maid follows her swain.\" \"Oh!\" quoth Bruno, \"I doubt not thou\r\nwilt make her thy prey: and I seem to see thee bite her dainty vermeil\r\nmouth and her cheeks, that shew as twin roses, with thy teeth, that are\r\nas so many lute-pegs, and afterwards devour her bodily.\" So encouraged,\r\nCalandrino fancied himself already in action, and went about singing and\r\ncapering in such high glee that 'twas as if he would burst his skin. And\r\nso next day he brought the rebeck, and to the no small amusement of all\r\nthe company sang several songs to her. And, in short, by frequently\r\nseeing her, he waxed so mad with passion that he gave over working; and a\r\nthousand times a day he would run now to the window, now to the door, and\r\nanon to the courtyard on the chance of catching sight of her; nor did\r\nshe, astutely following Bruno's instructions, fail to afford him\r\nabundance of opportunity. Bruno played the go-between, bearing him her\r\nanswers to all his messages, and sometimes bringing him messages from\r\nher. When she was not at home, which was most frequently the case, he\r\nwould send him letters from her, in which she gave great encouragement to\r\nhis hopes, at the same time giving him to understand that she was at the\r\nhouse of her kinsfolk, where as yet he might not visit her.\r\n\r\nOn this wise Bruno and Buffalmacco so managed the affair as to divert\r\nthemselves inordinately, causing him to send her, as at her request, now\r\nan ivory comb, now a purse, now a little knife, and other such dainty\r\ntrifles; in return for which they brought him, now and again, a\r\ncounterfeit ring of no value, with which Calandrino was marvellously\r\npleased. And Calandrino, to stimulate their zeal in his interest, would\r\nentertain them hospitably at table, and otherwise flatter them. Now, when\r\nthey had thus kept him in play for two good months, and the affair was\r\njust where it had been, Calandrino, seeing that the work was coming to an\r\nend, and bethinking him that, if it did so before he had brought his love\r\naffair to a successful issue, he must give up all hopes of ever so doing,\r\nbegan to be very instant and importunate with Bruno. So, in the presence\r\nof the damsel, and by preconcert with her and Filippo, quoth Bruno to\r\nCalandrino:--\"Harkye, comrade, this lady has vowed to me a thousand times\r\nthat she will do as thou wouldst have her, and as, for all that, she does\r\nnought to pleasure thee, I am of opinion that she leads thee by the nose:\r\nwherefore, as she keeps not her promises, we will make her do so,\r\nwilly-nilly, if thou art so minded.\" \"Nay, but, for the love of God, so\r\nbe it,\" replied Calandrino, \"and that speedily.\" \"Darest thou touch her,\r\nthen, with a scroll that I shall give thee?\" quoth Bruno. \"I dare,\"\r\nreplied Calandrino. \"Fetch me, then,\" quoth Bruno, \"a bit of the skin of\r\nan unborn lamb, a live bat, three grains of incense, and a blessed\r\ncandle; and leave the rest to me.\" To catch the bat taxed all\r\nCalandrino's art and craft for the whole of the evening; but having at\r\nlength taken him, he brought him with the other matters to Bruno: who,\r\nhaving withdrawn into a room by himself, wrote on the skin some\r\ncabalistic jargon, and handed it to him, saying:--\"Know, Calandrino,\r\nthat, if thou touch her with this scroll, she will follow thee forthwith,\r\nand do whatever thou shalt wish. Wherefore, should Filippo go abroad\r\nto-day, get thee somehow up to her, and touch her; and then go into the\r\nbarn that is hereby--'tis the best place we have, for never a soul goes\r\nthere--and thou wilt see that she will come there too. When she is there,\r\nthou wottest well what to do.\" Calandrino, overjoyed as ne'er another,\r\ntook the scroll, saying only:--\"Comrade, leave that to me.\"\r\n\r\nNow Nello, whom Calandrino mistrusted, entered with no less zest than the\r\nothers into the affair, and was their confederate for Calandrino's\r\ndiscomfiture; accordingly by Bruno's direction he hied to Florence, and\r\nfinding Monna Tessa:--\"Thou hast scarce forgotten, Tessa,\" quoth he,\r\n\"what a beating Calandrino gave thee, without the least cause, that day\r\nwhen he came home with the stones from Mugnone; for which I would have\r\nthee be avenged, and, so thou wilt not, call me no more kinsman or\r\nfriend. He is fallen in love with a lady up there, who is abandoned\r\nenough to go closeting herself not seldom with him, and 'tis but a short\r\nwhile since they made assignation to forgather forthwith: so I would have\r\nthee go there, and surprise him in the act, and give him a sound\r\ntrouncing.\" Which when the lady heard, she deemed it no laughing matter;\r\nbut started up and broke out with:--\"Alas, the arrant knave! is't thus he\r\ntreats me? By the Holy Rood, never fear but I will pay him out!\" And\r\nwrapping herself in her cloak, and taking a young woman with her for\r\ncompanion, she sped more at a run than at a walk, escorted by Nello, up\r\nto Camerata. Bruno, espying her from afar, said to Filippo:--\"Lo, here\r\ncomes our friend.\" Whereupon Filippo went to the place where Calandrino\r\nand the others were at work, and said:--\"My masters, I must needs go at\r\nonce to Florence; slacken not on that account.\" And so off he went, and\r\nhid himself where, unobserved, he might see what Calandrino would do.\r\nCalandrino waited only until he saw that Filippo was at some distance,\r\nand then he went down into the courtyard, where he found Niccolosa alone,\r\nand fell a talking with her. She, knowing well what she had to do, drew\r\nclose to him, and shewed him a little more familiarity than she was wont:\r\nwhereupon Calandrino touched her with the scroll, and having so done,\r\nsaying never a word, bent his steps towards the barn, whither Niccolosa\r\nfollowed him, and being entered, shut the door, and forthwith embraced\r\nhim, threw him down on the straw that lay there, and got astride of him,\r\nand holding him fast by the arms about the shoulders, suffered him not to\r\napproach his face to hers, but gazing upon him, as if he were the delight\r\nof her heart:--\"O Calandrino, sweet my Calandrino,\" quoth she, \"heart of\r\nmy body, my very soul, my bliss, my consolation, ah! how long have I\r\nyearned to hold thee in my arms and have thee all my own! Thy endearing\r\nways have utterly disarmed me; thou hast made prize of my heart with thy\r\nrebeck. Do I indeed hold thee in mine embrace?\" Calandrino, scarce able\r\nto move, murmured:--\"Ah! sweet my soul, suffer me to kiss thee.\"\r\nWhereto:--\"Nay, but thou art too hasty,\" replied Niccolosa. \"Let me first\r\nfeast mine eyes on thee; let me but sate them with this sweet face of\r\nthine.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bruno and Buffalmacco had joined Filippo, so that what passed\r\nwas seen and heard by all three. And while Calandrino was thus intent to\r\nkiss Niccolosa, lo, up came Nello with Monna Tessa. \"By God, I swear they\r\nare both there,\" ejaculated Nello, as they entered the doorway; but the\r\nlady, now fairly furious, laid hold of him and thrust him aside, and\r\nrushing in, espied Niccolosa astride of Calandrino. Niccolosa no sooner\r\ncaught sight of the lady, than up she jumped, and in a trice was beside\r\nFilippo. Monna Tessa fell upon Calandrino, who was still on the floor,\r\nplanted her nails in his face, and scratched it all over: she then seized\r\nhim by the hair, and hauling him to and fro about the barn:--\"Foul,\r\npestilent cur,\" quoth she, \"is this the way thou treatest me? Thou old\r\nfool! A murrain on the love I have borne thee! Hast thou not enough to do\r\nat home, that thou must needs go falling in love with strange women? And\r\na fine lover thou wouldst make! Dost not know thyself, knave? Dost not\r\nknow thyself, wretch? Thou, from whose whole body 'twere not possible to\r\nwring enough sap for a sauce! God's faith, 'twas not Tessa that got thee\r\nwith child: God's curse on her, whoever she was: verily she must be a\r\npoor creature to be enamoured of a jewel of thy rare quality.\" At sight\r\nof his wife, Calandrino, suspended, as it were, between life and death,\r\nventured no defence; but, his face torn to shreds, his hair and clothes\r\nall disordered, fumbled about for his capuche, which having found, up he\r\ngot, and humbly besought his wife not to publish the matter, unless she\r\nwere minded that he should be cut to pieces, for that she that was with\r\nhim was the wife of the master of the house. \"Then God give her a bad\r\nyear,\" replied the lady. Whereupon Bruno and Buffalmacco, who by this\r\ntime had laughed their fill with Filippo and Niccolosa, came up as if\r\nattracted by the noise; and after not a little ado pacified the lady, and\r\ncounselled Calandrino to go back to Florence, and stay there, lest\r\nFilippo should get wind of the affair, and do him a mischief. So\r\nCalandrino, crestfallen and woebegone, got him back to Florence with his\r\nface torn to shreds; where, daring not to shew himself at Camerata again,\r\nhe endured day and night the grievous torment of his wife's vituperation.\r\nSuch was the issue, to which, after ministering not a little mirth to his\r\ncomrades, as also to Niccolosa and Filippo, this ardent lover brought his\r\namour.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VI.\r\n\r\n--\r\nTwo young men lodge at an inn, of whom the one lies with the host's\r\ndaughter, his wife by inadvertence lying with the other. He that lay with\r\nthe daughter afterwards gets into her father's bed and tells him all,\r\ntaking him to be his comrade. They bandy words: whereupon the good woman,\r\napprehending the circumstances, gets her to bed with her daughter, and by\r\ndivers apt words re-establishes perfect accord.\r\n--\r\n\r\nCalandrino as on former occasions, so also on this, moved the company to\r\nlaughter. However, when the ladies had done talking of his doings, the\r\nqueen called for a story from Pamfilo, who thus spoke:--Worshipful\r\nladies, this Niccolosa, that Calandrino loved, has brought to my mind a\r\nstory of another Niccolosa; which I am minded to tell you, because 'twill\r\nshew you how a good woman by her quick apprehension avoided a great\r\nscandal.\r\n\r\nIn the plain of Mugnone there was not long ago a good man that furnished\r\ntravellers with meat and drink for money, and, for that he was in poor\r\ncircumstances, and had but a little house, gave not lodging to every\r\ncomer, but only to a few that he knew, and if they were hard bested. Now\r\nthe good man had to wife a very fine woman, and by her had two children,\r\nto wit, a pretty and winsome girl of some fifteen or sixteen summers, as\r\nyet unmarried, and a little boy, not yet one year old, whom the mother\r\nsuckled at her own breast. The girl had found favour in the eyes of a\r\ngoodly and mannerly young gentleman of our city, who was not seldom in\r\nthose parts, and loved her to the point of passion. And she, being\r\nmightily flattered to be loved by such a gallant, studied how to comport\r\nherself so debonairly as to retain his regard, and while she did so, grew\r\nlikewise enamoured of him; and divers times, by consent of both their\r\nlove had had its fruition, but that Pinuccio--such was the gallant's\r\nname--shrank from the disgrace that 'twould bring upon the girl and\r\nhimself alike. But, as his passion daily waxed apace, Pinuccio, yearning\r\nto find himself abed with her, bethought him that he were best contrive\r\nto lodge with her father, deeming, from what he knew of her father's\r\neconomy, that, if he did so, he might effect his purpose, and never a\r\nsoul be the wiser: which idea no sooner struck him, than he set about\r\ncarrying it into effect.\r\n\r\nSo, late one evening Pinuccio and a trusty comrade, Adriano by name, to\r\nwhom he had confided his love, hired two nags, and having set upon them\r\ntwo valises, filled with straw or such-like stuff, sallied forth of\r\nFlorence, and rode by a circuitous route to the plain of Mugnone, which\r\nthey reached after nightfall; and having fetched a compass, so that it\r\nmight seem as if they were coming from Romagna, they rode up to the good\r\nman's house, and knocked at the door. The good man, knowing them both\r\nvery well, opened to them forthwith: whereupon:--\"Thou must even put us\r\nup to-night,\" quoth Pinuccio; \"we thought to get into Florence, but, for\r\nall the speed we could make, we are but arrived here, as thou seest, at\r\nthis hour.\" \"Pinuccio,\" replied the host, \"thou well knowest that I can\r\nbut make a sorry shift to lodge gentlemen like you; but yet, as night has\r\novertaken you here, and time serves not to betake you elsewhere, I will\r\ngladly give you such accommodation as I may.\" The two gallants then\r\ndismounted and entered the inn, and having first looked to their horses,\r\nbrought out some supper that they had carried with them, and supped with\r\nthe host.\r\n\r\nNow the host had but one little bedroom, in which were three beds, set,\r\nas conveniently as he could contrive, two on one side of the room, and\r\nthe third on the opposite side, but, for all that, there was scarce room\r\nenough to pass through. The host had the least discomfortable of the\r\nthree beds made up for the two friends; and having quartered them there,\r\nsome little while afterwards, both being awake, but feigning to be\r\nasleep, he caused his daughter to get into one of the other two beds,\r\nwhile he and his wife took their places in the third, the good woman\r\nsetting the cradle, in which was her little boy, beside the bed. Such,\r\nthen, being the partition made of the beds, Pinuccio, who had taken exact\r\nnote thereof, waited only until he deemed all but himself to be asleep,\r\nand then got softly up and stole to the bed in which lay his beloved, and\r\nlaid himself beside her; and she according him albeit a timorous yet a\r\ngladsome welcome, he stayed there, taking with her that solace of which\r\nboth were most fain.\r\n\r\nPinuccio being thus with the girl, it chanced that certain things, being\r\noverset by a cat, fell with a noise that aroused the good woman, who,\r\nfearing that it might be a matter of more consequence, got up as best she\r\nmight in the dark, and betook her to the place whence the noise seemed to\r\nproceed. At the same time Adriano, not by reason of the noise, which he\r\nheeded not, but perchance to answer the call of nature, also got up, and\r\nquesting about for a convenient place, came upon the cradle beside the\r\ngood woman's bed; and not being able otherwise to go by, took it up, and\r\nset it beside his own bed, and when he had accomplished his purpose, went\r\nback, and giving never a thought to the cradle got him to bed. The good\r\nwoman searched until she found that the accident was no such matter as\r\nshe had supposed; so without troubling to strike a light to investigate\r\nit further, she reproved the cat, and returned to the room, and groped\r\nher way straight to the bed in which her husband lay asleep; but not\r\nfinding the cradle there, quoth she to herself:--Alas! blunderer that I\r\nam, what was I about? God's faith! I was going straight to the guests'\r\nbed; and proceeding a little further, she found the cradle, and laid\r\nherself down by Adriano in the bed that was beside it, taking Adriano for\r\nher husband; and Adriano, who was still awake, received her with all due\r\nbenignity, and tackled her more than once to her no small delight.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pinuccio fearing lest sleep should overtake him while he was\r\nyet with his mistress, and having satisfied his desire, got up and left\r\nher, to return to his bed; but when he got there, coming upon the cradle,\r\nhe supposed that 'twas the host's bed; and so going a little further, he\r\nlaid him down beside the host, who thereupon awoke. Supposing that he had\r\nAdriano beside him:--\"I warrant thee,\" quoth Pinuccio to the host, \"there\r\nwas never so sweet a piece of flesh as Niccolosa: by the body of God,\r\nsuch delight have I had of her as never had man of woman; and, mark me,\r\nsince I left thee, I have gotten me up to the farm some six times.\" Which\r\ntidings the host being none too well pleased to learn, said first of all\r\nto himself:--What the Devil does this fellow here? Then, his resentment\r\ngetting the better of his prudence:--\"'Tis a gross affront thou hast put\r\nupon me, Pinuccio,\" quoth he; \"nor know I what occasion thou hast to do\r\nme such a wrong; but by the body of God I will pay thee out.\" Pinuccio,\r\nwho was not the most discreet of gallants, albeit he was now apprised of\r\nhis error, instead of doing his best to repair it, retorted:--\"And how\r\nwilt thou pay me out? What canst thou do?\" \"Hark what high words our\r\nguests are at together!\" quoth meanwhile the host's wife to Adriano,\r\ndeeming that she spoke to her husband. \"Let them be,\" replied Adriano\r\nwith a laugh:--\"God give them a bad year: they drank too much yestereve.\"\r\nThe good woman had already half recognized her husband's angry tones, and\r\nnow that she heard Adriano's voice, she at once knew where she was and\r\nwith whom. Accordingly, being a discreet woman, she started up, and\r\nsaying never a word, took her child's cradle, and, though there was not a\r\nray of light in the room, bore it, divining rather than feeling her way,\r\nto the side of the bed in which her daughter slept; and then, as if\r\naroused by the noise made by her husband, she called him, and asked what\r\nhe and Pinuccio were bandying words about. \"Hearest thou not,\" replied\r\nthe husband, \"what he says he has this very night done to Niccolosa?\"\r\n\"Tush! he lies in the throat,\" returned the good woman: \"he has not lain\r\nwith Niccolosa; for what time he might have done so, I laid me beside her\r\nmyself, and I have been wide awake ever since; and thou art a fool to\r\nbelieve him. You men take so many cups before going to bed that then you\r\ndream, and walk in your sleep, and imagine wonders. 'Tis a great pity you\r\ndo not break your necks. What does Pinuccio there? Why keeps he not in\r\nhis own bed?\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Adriano, in his turn, seeing how adroitly the good woman\r\ncloaked her own and her daughter's shame:--\"Pinuccio,\" quoth he, \"I have\r\ntold thee a hundred times, that thou shouldst not walk about at night;\r\nfor this thy bad habit of getting up in thy dreams and relating thy\r\ndreams for truth will get thee into a scrape some time or another: come\r\nback, and God send thee a bad night.\" Hearing Adriano thus confirm what\r\nhis wife had said, the host began to think that Pinuccio must be really\r\ndreaming; so he took him by the shoulder, and fell a shaking him, and\r\ncalling him by his name, saying:--\"Pinuccio, wake up, and go back to thy\r\nbed.\" Pinuccio, taking his cue from what he had heard, began as a dreamer\r\nwould be like to do, to talk wanderingly; whereat the host laughed amain.\r\nThen, feigning to be aroused by the shaking, Pinuccio uttered Adriano's\r\nname, saying:--\"Is't already day, that thou callest me?\" \"Ay, 'tis so,\"\r\nquoth Adriano: \"come hither.\" Whereupon Pinuccio, making as if he were\r\nmighty drowsy, got him up from beside the host, and back to bed with\r\nAdriano. On the morrow, when they were risen, the host fell a laughing\r\nand making merry touching Pinuccio and his dreams. And so the jest passed\r\nfrom mouth to mouth, while the gallants' horses were groomed and saddled,\r\nand their valises adjusted: which done, they drank with the host, mounted\r\nand rode to Florence, no less pleased with the manner than with the\r\nmatter of the night's adventure. Nor, afterwards, did Pinuccio fail to\r\nfind other means of meeting Niccolosa, who assured her mother that he had\r\nunquestionably dreamed. For which cause the good woman, calling to mind\r\nAdriano's embrace, accounted herself the only one that had watched.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nTalano di Molese dreams that a wolf tears and rends all the neck and face\r\nof his wife: he gives her warning thereof, which she heeds not, and the\r\ndream comes true.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen Pamfilo had brought his story to a close, and all had commended the\r\ngood woman's quick perception, the queen bade Pampinea tell hers; and\r\nthus Pampinea began:--A while ago, debonair my ladies, we held discourse\r\nof the truths that dreams shew forth, which not a few of us deride; for\r\nwhich cause, albeit the topic has been handled before, I shall not spare\r\nto tell you that which not long ago befell a neighbour of mine, for that\r\nshe disbelieved a dream that her husband had.\r\n\r\nI wot not if you knew Talano di Molese, a man right worthy to be had in\r\nhonour; who, having married a young wife--Margarita by name--fair as e'er\r\nanother, but without her match for whimsical, fractious, and perverse\r\nhumours, insomuch that there was nought she would do at the instance of\r\nanother, either for his or her own good, found her behaviour most\r\ngrievous to bear, but was fain to endure what he might not cure. Now it\r\nso befell that Talano and Margarita being together at an estate that\r\nTalano had in the contado, he, sleeping, saw in a dream a very beautiful\r\nwood that was on the estate at no great distance from the house, and his\r\nlady there walking. And as she went, there leapt forth upon her a huge\r\nand fierce wolf that griped her by the throat, and bore her down to the\r\nground, and (she shrieking the while for succour) would have carried her\r\noff by main force; but she got quit of his jaws, albeit her neck and face\r\nshewed as quite disfigured. On the morrow, as soon as he was risen,\r\nTalano said to his wife:--\"Albeit for thy perversity I have not yet known\r\na single good day with thee, yet I should be sorry, wife, that harm\r\nshould befall thee; and therefore, if thou take my advice, thou wilt not\r\nstir out of doors to-day.\" \"Wherefore?\" quoth the lady; and thereupon he\r\nrecounted to her all his dream.\r\n\r\nThe lady shook her head, saying:--\"Who means ill, dreams ill. Thou makest\r\nas if thou wast mighty tender of me, but thou bodest of me in thy dream\r\nthat which thou wouldst fain see betide me. I warrant thee that to-day\r\nand all days I will have a care to avoid this or any other calamity that\r\nmight gladden thy heart.\" Whereupon:--\"Well wist I,\" replied Talano,\r\n\"that thou wouldst so say, for such is ever the requital of those that\r\ncomb scurfy heads; but whatever thou mayst be pleased to believe, I for\r\nmy part speak to thee for thy good, and again I advise thee to keep\r\nindoors to-day, or at least not to walk in the wood.\" \"Good,\" returned\r\nthe lady, \"I will look to it,\" and then she began communing with herself\r\non this wise:--Didst mark how artfully he thinks to have scared me from\r\ngoing into the wood to-day? Doubtless 'tis that he has an assignation\r\nthere with some light o' love, with whom he had rather I did not find\r\nhim. Ah! he would sup well with the blind, and what a fool were I to\r\nbelieve him! But I warrant he will be disappointed, and needs must I,\r\nthough I stay there all day long, see what commerce it is that he will\r\nadventure in to-day.\r\n\r\nHaving so said, she quitted the house on one side, while her husband did\r\nso on the other; and forthwith, shunning observation as best she might,\r\nshe hied her to the wood, and hid her where 'twas most dense, and there\r\nwaited on the alert, and glancing, now this way and now that, to see if\r\nany were coming. And while thus she stood, nor ever a thought of a wolf\r\ncrossed her mind, lo, forth of a close covert hard by came a wolf of\r\nmonstrous size and appalling aspect, and scarce had she time to say, God\r\nhelp me! before he sprang upon her and griped her by the throat so\r\ntightly that she might not utter a cry, but, passive as any lambkin, was\r\nborne off by him, and had certainly been strangled, had he not\r\nencountered some shepherds, who with shouts compelled him to let her go.\r\nThe shepherds recognized the poor hapless woman, and bore her home, where\r\nthe physicians by dint of long and careful treatment cured her; howbeit\r\nthe whole of her throat and part of her face remained so disfigured that,\r\nfair as she had been before, she was ever thereafter most foul and\r\nhideous to look upon. Wherefore, being ashamed to shew her face, she did\r\nmany a time bitterly deplore her perversity, in that, when it would have\r\ncost her nothing, she would nevertheless pay no heed to the true dream of\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VIII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nBiondello gulls Ciacco in the matter of a breakfast: for which prank\r\nCiacco is cunningly avenged on Biondello, causing him to be shamefully\r\nbeaten.\r\n--\r\n\r\nAll the company by common consent pronounced it no dream but a vision\r\nthat Talano had had in his sleep, so exactly, no circumstance lacking,\r\nhad it fallen out according as he had seen it. However, as soon as all\r\nhad done speaking, the queen bade Lauretta follow suit; which Lauretta\r\ndid on this wise:--As, most discreet my ladies, those that have preceded\r\nme to-day have almost all taken their cue from somewhat that has been\r\nsaid before, so, prompted by the stern vengeance taken by the scholar in\r\nPampinea's narrative of yesterday, I am minded to tell you of a vengeance\r\nthat was indeed less savage, but for all that grievous enough to him on\r\nwhom it was wreaked.\r\n\r\nWherefore I say that there was once at Florence one that all folk called\r\nCiacco, a man second to none that ever lived for inordinate gluttony,\r\nwho, lacking the means to support the expenditure which his gluttony\r\ndemanded, and being, for the rest, well-mannered and well furnished with\r\nexcellent and merry jests, did, without turning exactly court jester,\r\ncultivate a somewhat biting wit, and loved to frequent the houses of the\r\nrich, and such as kept good tables; whither, bidden or unbidden, he not\r\nseldom resorted for breakfast or supper. There was also in those days at\r\nFlorence one that was called Biondello, a man very short of stature, and\r\nnot a little debonair, more trim than any fly, with his blond locks\r\nsurmounted by a coif, and never a hair out of place; and he and Ciacco\r\nwere two of a trade.\r\n\r\nNow one morning in Lent Biondello, being in the fish-market purchasing\r\ntwo mighty fat lampreys for Messer Vieri de' Cerchi, was observed thus\r\nengaged by Ciacco, who came up to him, and:--\"What means this?\" quoth he.\r\n\"Why,\" replied Biondello, \"'tis that yestereve Messer Corso Donati had\r\nthree lampreys much finer than these and a sturgeon sent to his house,\r\nbut as they did not suffice for a breakfast that he is to give certain\r\ngentlemen, he has commissioned me to buy him these two beside. Wilt thou\r\nnot be there?\" \"Ay, marry, that will I,\" returned Ciacco. And in what he\r\ndeemed due time he hied him to Messer Corso Donati's house, where he\r\nfound him with some of his neighbours not yet gone to breakfast. And\r\nbeing asked by Messer Corso with what intent he was come, he\r\nanswered:--\"I am come, Sir, to breakfast with you and your company.\" \"And\r\nwelcome art thou,\" returned Messer Corso, \"go we then to breakfast, for\r\n'tis now the time.\" So to table they went, where nought was set before\r\nthem but pease and the inward part of the tunny salted, and afterwards\r\nthe common fish of the Arno fried. Wherefore Ciacco, not a little wroth\r\nat the trick that he perceived Biondello had played him, resolved to pay\r\nhim out. And not many days after Biondello, who had meanwhile had many a\r\nlaugh with his friends over Ciacco's discomfiture, met him, and after\r\ngreeting him, asked him with a laugh what Messer Corso's lampreys had\r\nbeen like. \"That question,\" replied Ciacco, \"thou wilt be able to answer\r\nmuch better than I before eight days are gone by.\" And parting from\r\nBiondello upon the word, he went forthwith and hired a cozening rogue,\r\nand having thrust a glass bottle into his hand, brought him within sight\r\nof the Loggia de' Cavicciuli; and there, pointing to a knight, one Messer\r\nFilippo Argenti, a tall man and stout, and of a high courage, and\r\nhaughty, choleric and cross-grained as ne'er another, he said to\r\nhim:--\"Thou wilt go, flask in hand, to Messer Filippo, and wilt say to\r\nhim:--'I am sent to you, Sir, by Biondello, who entreats you to be\r\npleased to colour this flask for him with some of your good red wine, for\r\nthat he is minded to have a good time with his catamites.' And of all\r\nthings have a care that he lay not hands upon thee, for he would make\r\nthee rue the day, and would spoil my sport.\" \"Have I aught else to say?\"\r\nenquired the rogue. \"Nothing more,\" returned Ciacco: \"and now get thee\r\ngone, and when thou hast delivered the message, bring me back the flask,\r\nand I will pay thee.\"\r\n\r\nSo away went the rogue, and did the errand to Messer Filippo, who\r\nforthwith, being a hasty man, jumped to the conclusion that Biondello,\r\nwhom he knew, was making mock of him, and while an angry flush overspread\r\nhis face:--\"Colour the flask, forsooth!\" quoth he, \"and 'Catamites!' God\r\nsend thee and him a bad year!\" and therewith up he started, and reached\r\nforward to lay hold of the rogue, who, being on the alert, gave him the\r\nslip and was off, and reported Messer Filippo's answer to Ciacco, who had\r\nobserved what had passed. Having paid the rogue, Ciacco rested not until\r\nhe had found Biondello, to whom:--\"Wast thou but now,\" quoth he, \"at the\r\nLoggia de' Cavicciuli?\" \"Indeed no,\" replied Biondello: \"wherefore such a\r\nquestion?\" \"Because,\" returned Ciacco, \"I may tell thee that thou art\r\nsought for by Messer Filippo, for what cause I know not.\" \"Good,\" quoth\r\nBiondello, \"I will go thither and speak with him.\" So away went\r\nBiondello, and Ciacco followed him to see what course the affair would\r\ntake.\r\n\r\nNow having failed to catch the rogue, Messer Filippo was still very\r\nwroth, and inly fumed and fretted, being unable to make out aught from\r\nwhat the rogue had said save that Biondello was set on by some one or\r\nanother to flout him. And while thus he vexed his spirit, up came\r\nBiondello; whom he no sooner espied than he made for him, and dealt him a\r\nmighty blow in the face, and tore his hair and coif, and cast his capuche\r\non the ground, and to his \"Alas, Sir, what means this?\" still beating him\r\namain:--\"Traitor,\" cried he; \"I will give thee to know what it means to\r\nsend me such a message. 'Colour the flask,' forsooth, and 'Catamites!'\r\nDost take me for a stripling, to be befooled by thee?\" And therewith he\r\npummelled Biondello's face all over with a pair of fists that were liker\r\nto iron than aught else, until it was but a mass of bruises; he also tore\r\nand dishevelled all his hair, tumbled him in the mud, rent all his\r\nclothes upon his back, and that without allowing him breathing-space to\r\nask why he thus used him, or so much as utter a word. \"Colour me the\r\nflask!\" and \"Catamites!\" rang in his ears; but what the words signified\r\nhe knew not. In the end very badly beaten, and in very sorry and ragged\r\ntrim, many folk having gathered around them, they, albeit not without the\r\nutmost difficulty, rescued him from Messer Filippo's hands, and told him\r\nwhy Messer Filippo had thus used him, censuring him for sending him such\r\na message, and adding that thenceforth he would know Messer Filippo\r\nbetter, and that he was not a man to be trifled with. Biondello told them\r\nin tearful exculpation that he had never sent for wine to Messer Filippo:\r\nthen, when they had put him in a little better trim, crestfallen and\r\nwoebegone, he went home imputing his misadventure to Ciacco. And when,\r\nmany days afterwards, the marks of his ill-usage being gone from his\r\nface, he began to go abroad again, it chanced that Ciacco met him, and\r\nwith a laugh:--\"Biondello,\" quoth he, \"how didst thou relish Messer\r\nFilippo's wine?\" \"Why, as to that,\" replied Biondello, \"would thou hadst\r\nrelished the lampreys of Messer Corso as much!\" \"So!\" returned Ciacco,\r\n\"such meat as thou then gavest me, thou mayst henceforth give me, as\r\noften as thou art so minded; and I will give thee even such drink as I\r\nhave given thee.\" So Biondello, witting that against Ciacco his might was\r\nnot equal to his spite, prayed God for his peace, and was careful never\r\nto flout him again.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IX.\r\n\r\n--\r\nTwo young men ask counsel of Solomon; the one, how he is to make himself\r\nbeloved, the other, how he is to reduce an unruly wife to order. The King\r\nbids the one to love, and the other to go to the Bridge of Geese.\r\n--\r\n\r\nNone now remained to tell save the queen, unless she were minded to\r\ninfringe Dioneo's privilege. Wherefore, when the ladies had laughed their\r\nfill over the misfortunes of Biondello, thus gaily the queen\r\nbegan:--Observe we, lovesome ladies, the order of things with a sound\r\nmind, and we shall readily perceive that we women are one and all\r\nsubjected by Nature and custom and law unto man, by him to be ruled and\r\ngoverned at his discretion; wherefore she, that would fain enjoy quietude\r\nand solace and comfort with the man to whom she belongs, ought not only\r\nto be chaste but lowly, patient and obedient: the which is the discreet\r\nwife's chief and most precious possession. And if the laws, which in all\r\nmatters have regard unto the common weal, and use and wont or custom\r\n(call it what you will), a power very great and to be had in awe, should\r\nnot suffice to school us thereto; yet abundantly clear is the witness of\r\nNature, which has fashioned our frames delicate and sensitive, and our\r\nspirits timorous and fearful, and has decreed that our bodily strength\r\nshall be slight, our voices tunable, and our movements graceful; which\r\nqualities do all avouch that we have need of others' governance. And\r\nwhoso has need of succour and governance ought in all reason to be\r\nobedient and submissive and reverent towards his governor. And whom have\r\nwe to govern and succour us save men? 'Tis then our bounden duty to give\r\nmen all honour and submit ourselves unto them: from which rule if any\r\ndeviate, I deem her most deserving not only of grave censure but of\r\nsevere chastisement. Which reflections, albeit they are not new to me, I\r\nam now led to make by what but a little while ago Pampinea told us\r\ntouching the perverse wife of Talano, on whom God bestowed that\r\nchastisement which the husband had omitted; and accordingly it jumps with\r\nmy judgment that all such women as deviate from the graciousness,\r\nkindliness and compliancy, which Nature and custom and law prescribe,\r\nmerit, as I said, stern and severe chastisement. Wherefore, as a salutary\r\nmedicine for the healing of those of us who may be afflicted with this\r\ndisease, I am minded to relate to you that which was once delivered by\r\nSolomon by way of counsel in such a case. Which let none that stands not\r\nin need of such physic deem to be meant for her, albeit a proverb is\r\ncurrent among men; to wit:--\r\n\r\n  Good steed, bad steed, alike need the rowel's prick,\r\n  Good wife, bad wife, alike demand the stick.\r\n\r\nWhich whoso should construe as a merry conceit would find you all ready\r\nenough to acknowledge its truth. But even in its moral significance I say\r\nthat it ought to command assent. For women are all by nature apt to be\r\nswayed and to fall; and therefore, for the correction of the wrong-doing\r\nof such as transgress the bounds assigned to them, there is need of the\r\nstick punitive; and also for the maintenance of virtue in others, that\r\nthey transgress not these appointed bounds, there is need of the stick\r\nauxiliary and deterrent. However, to cut short this preachment, and to\r\ncome to that which I purpose to tell you, I say:\r\n\r\nThat the bruit of the incomparable renown of the prodigious wisdom of\r\nSolomon, as also of the exceeding great liberality with which he accorded\r\nproof thereof to all that craved such assurance, being gone forth over\r\nwell-nigh all the earth, many from divers parts were wont to resort to\r\nhim for counsel in matters of most pressing and arduous importance; among\r\nwhom was a young man, Melisso by name, a very wealthy nobleman, who was,\r\nas had been his fathers before him, of Lazistan, and there dwelt. And as\r\nMelisso fared toward Jerusalem, on his departure from Antioch he fell in\r\nwith another young man, Giosefo by name, who was going the same way, and\r\nwith whom, after the manner of travellers, he entered into converse.\r\nMelisso, having learned from Giosefo, who and whence he was, asked him\r\nwhither he went, and on what errand: whereupon Giosefo made an answer\r\nthat he was going to seek counsel of Solomon, how he should deal with his\r\nwife, who had not her match among women for unruliness and perversity,\r\ninsomuch that neither entreaties nor blandishments nor aught else availed\r\nhim to bring her to a better frame. And thereupon he in like manner asked\r\nMelisso whence he was, and whither he was bound, and on what errand:\r\nwhereto:--\"Of Lazistan, I,\" replied Melisso, \"and like thyself in evil\r\nplight; for albeit I am wealthy and spend my substance freely in\r\nhospitably entertaining and honourably entreating my fellow-citizens, yet\r\nfor all that, passing strange though it be to think upon, I find never a\r\nsoul to love me; and therefore I am bound to the self-same place as thou,\r\nto be advised how it may come to pass that I be beloved.\"\r\n\r\nSo the two men fared on together, and being arrived at Jerusalem, were,\r\nby the good offices of one of Solomon's barons, ushered into his\r\npresence, and Melisso having briefly laid his case before the King, was\r\nanswered in one word:--\"Love.\" Which said, Melisso was forthwith\r\ndismissed, and Giosefo discovered the reason of his coming. To whom\r\nSolomon made no answer but:--\"Get thee to the Bridge of Geese.\" Whereupon\r\nGiosefo was likewise promptly ushered out of the King's presence, and\r\nfinding Melisso awaiting him, told him what manner of answer he had\r\ngotten. Which utterances of the King the two men pondered, but finding\r\ntherein nought that was helpful or relevant to their need, they doubted\r\nthe King had but mocked them, and set forth upon their homeward journey.\r\n\r\nNow when they had been some days on the road, they came to a river, which\r\nwas spanned by a fine bridge, and a great caravan of sumpter mules and\r\nhorses being about to cross, they must needs tarry, until the caravan had\r\npassed by. The more part of which had done so, when it chanced that a\r\nmule turned sulky, as we know they will not seldom do, and stood stock\r\nstill; wherefore a muleteer took a stick and fell a beating the mule\r\ntherewith, albeit at first with no great vigour, to urge the mule\r\nforward. The mule, however, swerving, now to this, now to the other side\r\nof the bridge, and sometimes facing about, utterly refused to go forward.\r\nWhereat the muleteer, wroth beyond measure, fell a belabouring him with\r\nthe stick now on the head, now on the flanks, and anon on the croup,\r\nnever so lustily, but all to no purpose. Which caused Melisso and Giosefo\r\nofttimes to say to him:--\"How now, caitiff? What is this thou doest?\r\nWouldst kill the beast? Why not try if thou canst not manage him kindly\r\nand gently? He would start sooner so than for this cudgelling of thine.\"\r\nTo whom:--\"You know your horses,\" replied the muleteer, \"and I know my\r\nmule: leave me to deal with him.\" Which said, he resumed his cudgelling\r\nof the mule, and laid about him on this side and on that to such purpose\r\nthat he started him; and so the honours of the day rested with the\r\nmuleteer. Now, as the two young men were leaving the bridge behind them,\r\nGiosefo asked a good man that sate at its head what the bridge was\r\ncalled, and was answered:--\"Sir, 'tis called the Bridge of Geese.\" Which\r\nGiosefo no sooner heard than he called to mind Solomon's words, and\r\nturning to Melisso:--\"Now, comrade, I warrant thee I may yet find\r\nSolomon's counsel sound and good, for that I knew not how to beat my wife\r\nis abundantly clear to me; and this muleteer has shewn me what I have to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nNow some days afterwards they arrived at Antioch, where Giosefo prevailed\r\nupon Melisso to tarry with him and rest a day or two; and meeting with\r\nbut a sorry welcome on the part of his wife, he told her to take her\r\norders as to supper from Melisso, who, seeing that such was Giosefo's\r\nwill, briefly gave her his instructions; which the lady, as had been her\r\nwont, not only did not obey, but contravened in almost every particular.\r\nWhich Giosefo marking:--\"Wast thou not told,\" quoth he angrily, \"after\r\nwhat fashion thou wast to order the supper?\" Whereto:--\"So!\" replied the\r\nlady haughtily: \"what means this? If thou hast a mind to sup, why take\r\nnot thy supper? No matter what I was told, 'tis thus I saw fit to order\r\nit. If it like thee, so be it: if not, 'tis thine affair.\" Melisso heard\r\nthe lady with surprise and inward disapprobation: Giosefo retorted:--\"Ay\r\nwife, thou art still as thou wast used to be; but I will make thee mend\r\nthy manners.\" Then, turning to Melisso:--\"Friend,\" quoth he, \"thou wilt\r\nsoon prove the worth of Solomon's counsel: but, prithee, let it not irk\r\nthee to look on, and deem that what I shall do is but done in sport; and\r\nif thou shouldst be disposed to stand in my way, bear in mind how we were\r\nanswered by the muleteer, when we pitied his mule.\" \"I am in thy house,\"\r\nreplied Melisso, \"and thy pleasure is to me law.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon Giosefo took a stout cudgel cut from an oak sapling, and hied\r\nhim into the room whither the lady had withdrawn from the table in high\r\ndudgeon, seized her by the hair, threw her on to the floor at his feet,\r\nand fell a beating her amain with the cudgel. The lady at first uttered a\r\nshriek or two, from which she passed to threats; but seeing that, for all\r\nthat, Giosefo slackened not, by the time she was thoroughly well\r\nthrashed, she began to cry him mercy, imploring him not to kill her, and\r\nadding that henceforth his will should be to her for law. But still\r\nGiosefo gave not over, but with ever fresh fury dealt her mighty\r\nswingeing blows, now about the ribs, now on the haunches, now over the\r\nshoulders; nor had he done with the fair lady, until, in short, he had\r\nleft never a bone or other part of her person whole, and he was fairly\r\nspent. Then, returning to Melisso:--\"To-morrow,\" quoth he, \"we shall see\r\nwhether 'Get thee to the Bridge of Geese' will prove to have been sound\r\nadvice or no.\" And so, having rested a while, and then washed his hands,\r\nhe supped with Melisso. With great pain the poor lady got upon her feet\r\nand laid herself on her bed, and having there taken such rest as she\r\nmight, rose betimes on the morrow, and craved to know of Giosefo what he\r\nwas minded to have to breakfast. Giosefo, laughing with Melisso over the\r\nmessage, gave her his directions, and when in due time they came to\r\nbreakfast, they found everything excellently ordered according as it had\r\nbeen commanded: for which cause the counsel, which they had at first\r\nfailed to understand, now received their highest commendation.\r\n\r\nSome few days later Melisso, having taken leave of Giosefo, went home,\r\nand told a wise man the counsel he had gotten from Solomon.\r\nWhereupon:--\"And no truer or sounder advice could he have given thee,\"\r\nquoth the sage: \"thou knowest that thou lovest never a soul, and that the\r\nhonours thou payest and the services thou renderest to others are not\r\nprompted by love of them, but by love of display. Love, then, as Solomon\r\nbade thee, and thou shalt be loved.\" On such wise was the unruly\r\nchastised; and the young man, learning to love, was beloved.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL X.\r\n\r\n--\r\nDom Gianni at the instance of his gossip Pietro uses an enchantment to\r\ntransform Pietro's wife into a mare; but, when he comes to attach the\r\ntail, Gossip Pietro, by saying that he will have none of the tail, makes\r\nthe enchantment of no effect.\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe queen's story evoked some murmurs from the ladies and some laughter\r\nfrom the young men; however, when they were silent, Dioneo thus\r\nbegan:--Dainty my ladies, a black crow among a flock of white doves\r\nenhances their beauty more than would a white swan; and so, when many\r\nsages are met together, their ripe wisdom not only shews the brighter and\r\ngoodlier for the presence of one that is not so wise, but may even derive\r\npleasure and diversion therefrom. Wherefore as you, my ladies, are one\r\nand all most discreet and judicious, I, who know myself to be somewhat\r\nscant of sense, should, for that by my demerit I make your merit shew the\r\nmore glorious, be more dear to you, than if by my greater merit I\r\neclipsed yours, and by consequence should have more ample license to\r\nreveal myself to you as I am; and therefore have more patient sufferance\r\non your part than would be due to me, were I more discreet, in the\r\nrelation of the tale which I am about to tell you. 'Twill be, then, a\r\nstory none too long, wherefrom you may gather with what exactitude it\r\nbehoves folk to observe the injunctions of those that for any purpose use\r\nan enchantment, and how slight an error committed therein make bring to\r\nnought all the work of the enchanter.\r\n\r\nA year or so ago there was at Barletta a priest named Dom Gianni di\r\nBarolo, who, to eke out the scanty pittance his church afforded him, set\r\na pack-saddle upon his mare, and took to going the round of the fairs of\r\nApulia, buying and selling merchandise. And so it befell that he clapped\r\nup a close acquaintance with one Pietro da Tresanti, who plied the same\r\ntrade as he, albeit instead of a mare he had but an ass; whom in token of\r\nfriendship and good-fellowship Dom Gianni after the Apulian fashion\r\ncalled ever Gossip Pietro, and had him to his house and there lodged and\r\nhonourably entreated him as often as he came to Barletta. Gossip Pietro\r\non his part, albeit he was very poor and had but a little cot at\r\nTresanti, that scarce sufficed for himself, his fair, young wife, and\r\ntheir ass, nevertheless, whenever Dom Gianni arrived at Tresanti, made\r\nhim welcome, and did him the honours of his house as best he might, in\r\nrequital of the hospitality which he received at Barletta. However, as\r\nGossip Pietro had but one little bed, in which he slept with his fair\r\nwife, 'twas not in his power to lodge Dom Gianni as comfortably as he\r\nwould have liked; but the priest's mare being quartered beside the ass in\r\na little stable, the priest himself must needs lie beside her on the\r\nstraw. Many a time when the priest came, the wife, knowing how honourably\r\nhe entreated her husband at Barletta, would fain have gone to sleep with\r\na neighbour, one Zita Carapresa di Giudice Leo, that the priest might\r\nshare the bed with her husband, and many a time had she told the priest\r\nso howbeit he would never agree to it, and on one occasion:--\"Gossip\r\nGemmata,\" quoth he, \"trouble not thyself about me; I am well lodged; for,\r\nwhen I am so minded, I turn the mare into a fine lass and dally with her,\r\nand then, when I would, I turn her back into a mare; wherefore I could\r\nill brook to part from her.\" The young woman, wondering but believing,\r\ntold her husband what the priest had said, adding:--\"If he is even such a\r\nfriend as thou sayst, why dost thou not get him to teach thee the\r\nenchantment, so that thou mayst turn me into a mare, and have both ass\r\nand mare for thine occasions? We should then make twice as much gain as\r\nwe do, and thou couldst turn me back into a woman when we came home at\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nGossip Pietro, whose wit was somewhat blunt, believed that 'twas as she\r\nsaid, approved her counsel, and began adjuring Dom Gianni, as\r\npersuasively as he might, to teach him the incantation. Dom Gianni did\r\nhis best to wean him of his folly; but as all was in vain:--\"Lo, now,\"\r\nquoth he, \"as you are both bent on it, we will be up, as is our wont,\r\nbefore the sun to-morrow morning, and I will shew you how 'tis done. The\r\ntruth is that 'tis in the attachment of the tail that the great\r\ndifficulty lies, as thou wilt see.\" Scarce a wink of sleep had either\r\nGossip Pietro or Gossip Gemmata that night, so great was their anxiety;\r\nand towards daybreak up they got, and called Dom Gianni; who, being\r\nrisen, came in his shirt into Gossip Pietro's little bedroom, and:--\"I\r\nknow not,\" quoth he, \"that there is another soul in the world for whom I\r\nwould do this, save you, my gossips; however, as you will have it so, I\r\nwill do it, but it behoves you to do exactly as I bid you, if you would\r\nhave the enchantment work.\" They promised obedience, and Dom Gianni\r\nthereupon took a light, which he handed to Gossip Pietro, saying:--\"Let\r\nnought that I shall do or say escape thee; and have a care, so thou\r\nwouldst not ruin all, to say never a word, whatever thou mayst see or\r\nhear; and pray God that the tail may be securely attached.\" So Gossip\r\nPietro took the light, and again promised obedience; Dom Gianni caused\r\nGossip Gemmata to strip herself stark naked, and stand on all fours like\r\na mare, at the same time strictly charging her that, whatever might\r\nhappen, she must utter no word. Then, touching her head and face:--\"Be\r\nthis a fine head of a mare,\" quoth he; in like manner touching her hair,\r\nhe said:--\"Be this a fine mane of a mare;\" touching her arms:--\"Be these\r\nfine legs and fine hooves of a mare;\" then, as he touched her breast and\r\nfelt its firm roundness, and there awoke and arose one that was not\r\ncalled:--\"And be this a fine breast of a mare,\" quoth he; and in like\r\nmanner he dealt with her back, belly, croup, thighs, and legs. Last of\r\nall, the work being complete save for the tail, he lifted his shirt and\r\ntook in his hand the tool with which he was used to plant men, and\r\nforthwith thrust it into the furrow made for it, saying:--\"And be this a\r\nfine tail of a mare.\" Whereat Gossip Pietro, who had followed everything\r\nvery heedfully to that point, disapproving that last particular,\r\nexclaimed:--\"No! Dom Gianni, I'll have no tail, I'll have no tail.\" The\r\nessential juice, by which all plants are propagated, was already\r\ndischarged, when Dom Gianni withdrew the tool, saying:--\"Alas! Gossip\r\nPietro, what hast thou done? Did I not tell thee to say never a word, no\r\nmatter what thou mightst see? The mare was all but made; but by speaking\r\nthou hast spoiled all; and 'tis not possible to repeat the enchantment.\"\r\n\"Well and good,\" replied Gossip Pietro, \"I would have none of that tail.\r\nWhy saidst thou not to me:--'Make it thou'? And besides, thou wast\r\nattaching it too low.\" \"'Twas because,\" returned Dom Gianni, \"thou\r\nwouldst not have known, on the first essay, how to attach it so well as\r\nI.\" Whereupon the young woman stood up, and in all good faith said to her\r\nhusband:--\"Fool that thou art, wherefore hast thou brought to nought what\r\nhad been for the good of us both? When didst thou ever see mare without a\r\ntail? So help me God, poor as thou art, thou deservest to be poorer\r\nstill.\" So, after Gossip Pietro's ill-timed speech, there being no way\r\nleft of turning the young woman into a mare, downcast and melancholy she\r\nresumed her clothes; and Gossip Pietro plied his old trade with his ass,\r\nand went with Dom Gianni to the fair of Bitonto, and never asked him so\r\nto serve him again.\r\n\r\nWhat laughter this story drew from the ladies, who understood it better\r\nthan Dioneo had wished, may be left to the imagination of the fair one\r\nthat now laughs thereat. However, as the stories were ended, and the sun\r\nnow shone with a tempered radiance, the queen, witting that the end of\r\nher sovereignty was come, stood up and took off the crown, and set it on\r\nthe head of Pamfilo, whom alone it now remained thus to honour; and said\r\nwith a smile:--\"My lord, 'tis a great burden that falls upon thee, seeing\r\nthat thou, coming last, art bound to make good my shortcomings and those\r\nof my predecessors; which God give thee grace to accomplish, even as He\r\nhas given me grace to make thee king.\" With gladsome acknowledgment of\r\nthe honour:--\"I doubt not,\" replied Pamfilo, \"that, thanks to your noble\r\nqualities and those of my other subjects, I shall win even such praise as\r\nthose that have borne sway before me.\" Then, following the example of his\r\npredecessors, he made all meet arrangements in concert with the\r\nseneschal: after which, he turned to the expectant ladies, and thus\r\nspoke:--\"Enamoured my ladies, Emilia, our queen of to-day, deeming it\r\nproper to allow you an interval of rest to recruit your powers, gave you\r\nlicense to discourse of such matters as should most commend themselves to\r\neach in turn; and as thereby you are now rested, I judge that 'tis meet\r\nto revert to our accustomed rule. Wherefore I ordain that for to-morrow\r\nyou do each of you take thought how you may discourse of the ensuing\r\ntheme: to wit, of such as in matters of love, or otherwise, have done\r\nsomething with liberality or magnificence. By the telling, and (still\r\nmore) by the doing of such things, your spirits will assuredly be duly\r\nattuned and animated to emprise high and noble; whereby our life, which\r\ncannot but be brief, seeing that 'tis enshrined in a mortal body, fame\r\nshall perpetuate in glory; which whoso serves not the belly, as do the\r\nbeasts, must not only covet, but with all zeal seek after and labour to\r\nattain.\"\r\n\r\nThe gay company having, one and all, approved the theme, rose at a word\r\nfrom their new king, and betook them to their wonted pastimes, and so,\r\naccording as they severally had most lief, diverted them, until they\r\nblithely reunited for supper, which being served with all due care and\r\ndespatched, they rose up to dance, as they were wont, and when they had\r\nsung, perhaps, a thousand ditties, fitter to please by their words than\r\nby any excellence of musical art, the king bade Neifile sing one on her\r\nown account. And promptly and graciously, with voice clear and blithe,\r\nthus Neifile sang:--\r\n\r\nIn prime of maidenhood, and fair and feat\r\n  'Mid spring's fresh foison chant I merrily:\r\n  Thanks be to Love and to my fancies sweet.\r\n\r\nAs o'er the grassy mead I, glancing, fare,\r\n  I mark it white and yellow and vermeil dight\r\n  With flowers, the thorny rose, the lily white:\r\n  And all alike to his face I compare,\r\n  Who, loving, hath me ta'en, and me shall e'er\r\n  Hold bounden to his will, sith I am she\r\n  That in his will findeth her joy complete.\r\n\r\nWhereof if so it be that I do find\r\n  Any that I most like to him approve,\r\n  That pluck I straight and kiss with words of love,\r\n  Discovering all, as, best I may, my mind;\r\n  Yea, all my heart's desire; and then entwined\r\n  I set it in the chaplet daintily,\r\n  And with my yellow tresses bind and pleat.\r\n\r\nAnd as mine eyes do drink in the delight\r\n  Which the flower yields them, even so my mind,\r\n  Fired with his sweet love, doth such solace find,\r\n  As he himself were present to the sight:\r\n  But never word of mine discover might\r\n  That which the flower's sweet smell awakes in me:\r\n  Witness the true tale that my sighs repeat.\r\n\r\nFor from my bosom gentle and hot they fly,\r\n  Not like the gusty sighs that others heave,\r\n  Whenas they languish and do sorely grieve;\r\n  And to my love incontinent they hie:\r\n  Whereof when he is ware, he, by and by,\r\n  To meward hasting, cometh suddenly,\r\n  When:--\"Lest I faint,\" I cry, \"come, I entreat.\"\r\n\r\nThe king and all the ladies did not a little commend Neifile's song;\r\nafter which, as the night was far spent, the king bade all go to rest\r\nuntil the morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nEndeth here the ninth day of the Decameron, and beginneth the tenth, in\r\nwhich, under the rule of Pamfilo, discourse is had of such as in matters\r\nof love, or otherwise, have done something with liberality or\r\nmagnificence.\r\n--\r\n\r\nSome cloudlets in the West still shewed a vermeil flush, albeit those of\r\nthe eastern sky, as the sun's rays smote them anear, were already fringed\r\nas with most lucent gold, when uprose Pamfilo, and roused the ladies and\r\nhis comrades. And all the company being assembled, and choice made of the\r\nplace whither they should betake them for their diversion, he,\r\naccompanied by Filomena and Fiammetta, led the way at a slow pace,\r\nfollowed by all the rest. So fared they no little space, beguiling the\r\ntime with talk of their future way of life, whereof there was much to\r\ntell and much to answer, until, as the sun gained strength, they\r\nreturned, having made quite a long round, to the palace; and being\r\ngathered about the fountain, such as were so minded drank somewhat from\r\nbeakers rinsed in its pure waters; and then in the delicious shade of the\r\ngarden they hied them hither and thither, taking their pleasure until\r\nbreakfast-time. Their meal taken, they slept as they were wont; and then,\r\nat a spot chosen by the king, they reassembled, where Neifile, having\r\nreceived his command to lead the way, blithely thus began.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL I.\r\n\r\n--\r\nA knight in the service of the King of Spain deems himself ill requited.\r\nWherefore the King, by most cogent proof, shews him that the blame rests\r\nnot with him, but with the knight's own evil fortune; after which, he\r\nbestows upon him a noble gift.\r\n--\r\n\r\nHighly graced, indeed, do I deem myself, honourable my ladies, that our\r\nking should have given to me the precedence in a matter so arduous to\r\ntell of as magnificence: for, as the sun irradiates all the heaven with\r\nhis glory and beauty, even so does magnificence enhance the purity and\r\nthe splendour of every other virtue. I shall therefore tell you a story,\r\nwhich, to my thinking, is not a little pretty; and which, assuredly, it\r\nmust be profitable to call to mind.\r\n\r\nYou are to know, then, that, among other honourable knights that from\r\ndays of old even until now have dwelt in our city, one, and perchance the\r\nworthiest of all, was Messer Ruggieri de' Figiovanni. Who, being wealthy\r\nand magnanimous, reflecting on the customs and manner of life of Tuscany,\r\nperceived that by tarrying there he was like to find little or no\r\noccasion of shewing his mettle, and accordingly resolved to pass some\r\ntime at the court of Alfonso, King of Spain, who for the fame of his high\r\nqualities was without a peer among the potentates of his age. So, being\r\nwell provided with arms and horses and retinue suitable to his rank, he\r\nhied him to Spain, where he was graciously received by the King. There\r\ntarrying accordingly, Messer Ruggieri very soon, as well by the splendid\r\nstyle in which he lived as by the prodigious feats of arms that he did,\r\ngave folk to know his high desert.\r\n\r\nNow, having tarried there some while, and observed the King's ways with\r\nmuch care, and how he would grant castles, cities, or baronies, to this,\r\nthat, or the other of his subjects, he deemed that the King shewed\r\ntherein but little judgment, seeing that he would give them to men that\r\nmerited them not. And for that nought was given to him, he, knowing his\r\nmerit, deemed himself gravely injured in reputation; wherefore he made up\r\nhis mind to depart the realm, and to that end craved license of the King;\r\nwhich the King granted him, and therewith gave him one of the best and\r\nfinest mules that was ever ridden, a gift which Messer Ruggieri, as he\r\nhad a long journey to make, did not a little appreciate. The King then\r\nbade one of his discreet domestics contrive, as best he might, to ride\r\nwith Messer Ruggieri on such wise that it might not appear that he did so\r\nby the King's command, and charge his memory with whatever Messer\r\nRuggieri might say of him, so that he might be able to repeat it; which\r\ndone, he was on the very next morning to bid Ruggieri return to the King\r\nforthwith. The King's agent was on the alert, and no sooner was Ruggieri\r\nout of the city, than without any manner of difficulty he joined his\r\ncompany, giving out that he was going towards Italy. As thus they rode,\r\ntalking of divers matters, Messer Ruggieri being mounted on the mule\r\ngiven him by the King:--\"Methinks,\" quoth the other, it being then hard\r\nupon tierce, \"that 'twere well to give the beasts a voidance;\" and by and\r\nby, being come to a convenient place, they voided all the beasts save the\r\nmule. Then, as they continued their journey, the squire hearkening\r\nattentively to the knight's words, they came to a river, and while there\r\nthey watered the beasts, the mule made a voidance in the stream.\r\nWhereat:--\"Ah, foul fall thee, beast,\" quoth Messer Ruggieri, \"that art\r\neven as thy master, that gave thee to me!\" Which remark, as also many\r\nanother that fell from Ruggieri as they rode together throughout the day,\r\nthe squire stored in his memory; but never another word did he hear\r\nRuggieri say touching the King, that was not laudatory to the last\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, when they were gotten to horse, and had set their faces\r\ntowards Tuscany, the squire apprised Ruggieri of the King's command, and\r\nthereupon Ruggieri turned back. On his arrival the King, having already\r\nheard what he had said touching the mule, gave him gladsome greeting, and\r\nasked him wherefore he had likened him to the mule, or rather the mule to\r\nhim. Whereto Messer Ruggieri answered frankly:--\"My lord, I likened you\r\nto the mule, for that, as you bestow your gifts where 'tis not meet, and\r\nwhere meet it were, bestow them not, so the mule where 'twas meet, voided\r\nnot, and where 'twas not meet, voided.\" \"Messer Ruggieri,\" replied the\r\nKing, \"'tis not because I have not discerned in you a knight most good\r\nand true, for whose desert no gift were too great, that I have not\r\nbestowed on you such gifts as I have bestowed upon many others, who in\r\ncomparison of you are nothing worth: the fault is none of mine but solely\r\nof your fortune, which would not suffer me; and that this which I say is\r\ntrue, I will make abundantly plain to you.\" \"My lord,\" returned Messer\r\nRuggieri, \"mortified am I, not that you gave me no gift, for thereof I\r\nhad no desire, being too rich, but that you made no sign of recognition\r\nof my desert; however, I deem your explanation sound and honourable, and\r\nwhatever you shall be pleased that I should see, that gladly will I,\r\nalbeit I believe you without attestation.\"\r\n\r\nThe King then led him into one of the great halls, in which, by his\r\npreordinance, were two chests closed under lock and key, and, not a few\r\nothers being present, said to him:--\"Messer Ruggieri, one these chests\r\ncontains my crown, sceptre and orb, with many a fine girdle, buckle,\r\nring, and whatever else of jewellery I possess; the other is full of\r\nearth: choose then, and whichever you shall choose, be it yours; thereby\r\nyou will discover whether 'tis due to me or to your fortune that your\r\ndeserts have lacked requital.\" Such being the King's pleasure, Messer\r\nRuggieri chose one of the chests, which at the King's command being\r\nopened and found to be that which contained the earth:--\"Now, Messer\r\nRuggieri,\" quoth the King with a laugh, \"your own eyes may warrant you of\r\nthe truth of what I say touching Fortune; but verily your merit demands\r\nthat I take arms against her in your cause. I know that you are not\r\nminded to become a Spaniard, and therefore I shall give you neither\r\ncastle nor city; but that chest, which Fortune denied you, I bestow on\r\nyou in her despite, that you may take it with you to your own country,\r\nand there with your neighbours justly vaunt yourself of your deserts,\r\nattested by my gifts.\" Messer Ruggieri took the chest, and having thanked\r\nthe King in a manner befitting such a gift, returned therewith, well\r\npleased, to Tuscany.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL II.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGhino di Tacco captures the Abbot of Cluny, cures him of a disorder of\r\nthe stomach, and releases him. The abbot, on his return to the court of\r\nRome, reconciles Ghino with Pope Boniface, and makes him prior of the\r\nHospital.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen an end was made of extolling the magnificence shewn by King Alfonso\r\ntowards the Florentine knight, the king, who had listened to the story\r\nwith no small pleasure, bade Elisa follow suit; and forthwith Elisa\r\nbegan:--Dainty my ladies, undeniable it is that for a king to be\r\nmagnificent, and to entreat magnificently one that has done him service,\r\nis a great matter, and meet for commendation. What then shall we say when\r\nthe tale is of a dignitary of the Church that shewed wondrous\r\nmagnificence towards one whom he might well have entreated as an enemy,\r\nand not have been blamed by a soul? Assuredly nought else than that what\r\nin the king was virtue was in the prelate nothing less than a miracle,\r\nseeing that for superlative greed the clergy, one and all, outdo us\r\nwomen, and wage war to the knife upon every form of liberality. And\r\nalbeit all men are by nature prone to avenge their wrongs, 'tis notorious\r\nthat the clergy, however they may preach longsuffering, and commend of\r\nall things the forgiving of trespasses, are more quick and hot to be\r\navenged than the rest of mankind. Now this, to wit, after what manner a\r\nprelate shewed magnificence, will be made manifest to you in my story.\r\n\r\nGhino di Tacco, a man redoubtable by reason of his truculence and his\r\nhigh-handed deeds, being banished from Siena, and at enmity with the\r\nCounts of Santa Fiore, raised Radicofani in revolt against the Church of\r\nRome, and there abiding, harried all the surrounding country with his\r\nsoldiers, plundering all wayfarers. Now Pope Boniface VIII. being at\r\nRome, there came to court the Abbot of Cluny, who is reputed one of the\r\nwealthiest prelates in the world; and having there gotten a disorder of\r\nthe stomach, he was advised by the physicians to go to the baths of\r\nSiena, where (they averred) he would certainly be cured. So, having\r\nobtained the Pope's leave, reckless of the bruit of Ghino's exploits, he\r\ntook the road, being attended by a great and well-equipped train of\r\nsumpter-horses and servants. Ghino di Tacco, getting wind of his\r\napproach, spread his nets to such purpose as without the loss of so much\r\nas a boy to surround the abbot, with all his servants and effects, in a\r\nstrait pass, from which there was no exit. Which done, he sent one of his\r\nmen, the cunningest of them all, with a sufficient retinue to the abbot,\r\nwho most lovingly on Ghino's part besought the abbot to come and visit\r\nGhino at the castle. Whereto the abbot, very wroth, made answer that he\r\nwould none of it, for that nought had he to do with Ghino; but that he\r\npurposed to continue his journey, and would fain see who would hinder\r\nhim. \"Sir,\" returned the envoy, assuming a humble tone, \"you are come to\r\na part of the country where we have no fear of aught save the might of\r\nGod, and where excommunications and interdicts are one and all under the\r\nban; wherefore you were best be pleased to shew yourself agreeable to\r\nGhino in this particular.\" As they thus spoke, Ghino's soldiers shewed\r\nthemselves on every side, and it being thus manifest to the abbot that he\r\nand his company were taken prisoners, he, albeit mightily incensed,\r\nsuffered himself with all his train and effects to be conducted by the\r\nenvoy to the castle; where the abbot, being alighted, was lodged in a\r\nsmall and very dark and discomfortable room, while his retinue, according\r\nto their several conditions, were provided with comfortable quarters in\r\ndivers parts of the castle, the horses well stabled and all the effects\r\nsecured, none being in any wise tampered with. Which done, Ghino hied him\r\nto the abbot, and:--\"Sir,\" quoth he, \"Ghino, whose guest you are, sends\r\nme to entreat you to be pleased to inform him of your destination, and\r\nthe purpose of your journey.\" The abbot, vailing his pride like a wise\r\nman, told whither he was bound and for what purpose. Whereupon Ghino left\r\nhim, casting about how he might cure him without a bath. To which end he\r\nkept a great fire ever burning in the little chamber, and had it closely\r\nguarded, and returned not to the abbot until the ensuing morning, when he\r\nbrought him in a spotless napkin two slices of toast and a great beaker\r\nof vernaccia of Corniglia, being of the abbot's own vintage; and:--\"Sir,\"\r\nquoth he to the abbot, \"Ghino, as a young man, made his studies in\r\nmedicine, and avers that he then learned that there is no better\r\ntreatment for disorder of the stomach than that which he will afford you,\r\nwhereof the matters that I bring you are the beginning; wherefore take\r\nthem and be of good cheer.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbot, being far too hungry to make many words about the matter, ate\r\n(albeit in high dudgeon) the toast, and drank the vernaccia; which done,\r\nhe enlarged on his wrongs in a high tone, with much questioning and\r\nperpending; and above all he demanded to see Ghino. Part of what the\r\nabbot said Ghino disregarded as of no substance, to other part he replied\r\ncourteously enough; and having assured him that Ghino would visit him as\r\nsoon as might be, he took his leave of him; nor did he return until the\r\nmorrow, when he brought him toast and vernaccia in the same quantity as\r\nbefore; and so he kept him several days: then, having marked that the\r\nabbot had eaten some dried beans that he had secretly brought and left\r\nthere of set purpose, he asked him in Ghino's name how he felt in the\r\nstomach. \"Were I but out of Ghino's hands,\" replied the abbot, \"I should\r\nfeel myself well, indeed: next to which, I desire most of all a good\r\nbreakfast, so excellent a cure have his medicines wrought on me.\"\r\nWhereupon Ghino caused the abbot's servants to furnish a goodly chamber\r\nwith the abbot's own effects, and there on the morrow make ready a grand\r\nbanquet, at which all the abbot's suite and not a few of the garrison\r\nbeing assembled, he hied him to the abbot, and:--\"Sir,\" quoth he, \"'tis\r\ntime you left the infirmary, seeing that you now feel yourself well;\" and\r\nso saying, he took him by the hand, and led him into the chamber made\r\nready for him, and having left him there with his own people, made it his\r\nchief concern that the banquet should be magnificent. The abbot's spirits\r\nrevived as he found himself again among his men, with whom he talked a\r\nwhile, telling them how he had been entreated, wherewith they contrasted\r\nthe signal honour which they, on the other hand, had, one and all,\r\nreceived from Ghino.\r\n\r\nBreakfast-time came, and with order meet the abbot and the rest were\r\nregaled with good viands and good wines, Ghino still suffering not the\r\nabbot to know who he was. But when the abbot had thus passed several\r\ndays, Ghino, having first had all his effects collected in a saloon, and\r\nall his horses, to the poorest jade, in the courtyard below, hied him to\r\nthe abbot and asked him how he felt, and if he deemed himself strong\r\nenough to ride. The abbot replied that he was quite strong enough, and\r\nthat 'twould be well indeed with him, were he once out of Ghino's hands.\r\nGhino then led him into the saloon in which were his effects and all his\r\nretinue, and having brought him to a window, whence he might see all his\r\nhorses:--\"Sir Abbot,\" quoth he, \"you must know that 'tis not for that he\r\nhas an evil heart, but because, being a gentleman, he is banished from\r\nhis home, and reduced to poverty, and has not a few powerful enemies,\r\nthat in defence of his life and honour, Ghino di Tacco, whom you see\r\nbefore you, has become a robber of highways and an enemy to the court of\r\nRome. But such as I am, I have cured you of your malady of the stomach,\r\nand taking you to be a worthy lord, I purpose not to treat you as I would\r\nanother, from whom, were he in my hands, as you are, I should take such\r\npart of his goods as I should think fit; but I shall leave it to you,\r\nupon consideration of my need, to assign to me such portion of your goods\r\nas you yourself shall determine. Here are they before you undiminished\r\nand unimpaired, and from this window you may see your horses below in the\r\ncourtyard; wherefore take the part or take the whole, as you may see fit,\r\nand be it at your option to tarry here, or go hence, from this hour\r\nforth.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbot marvelled to hear a highway robber speak thus liberally, and\r\nsuch was his gratification that his wrath and fierce resentment departed\r\nfrom him, nay, were transformed into kindness, insomuch that in all\r\ncordial amity he hasted to embrace Ghino, saying:--\"By God I swear, that\r\nto gain the friendship of a man such I now deem thee to be, I would be\r\ncontent to suffer much greater wrong than that which until now, meseemed,\r\nthou hadst done me. Cursed be Fortune that constrains thee to ply so\r\ncensurable a trade.\" Which said, he selected a very few things, and none\r\nsuperfluous, from his ample store, and having done likewise with the\r\nhorses, ceded all else to Ghino, and hied him back to Rome; where, seeing\r\nhim, the Pope, who to his great grief had heard of his capture, asked him\r\nwhat benefit he had gotten from the baths. Whereto the abbot made answer\r\nwith a smile:--\"Holy Father, I found nearer here than the baths a worthy\r\nphysician who has wrought a most excellent cure on me:\" he then recounted\r\nall the circumstances, whereat the Pope laughed. Afterwards, still\r\npursuing the topic, the abbot, yielding to the promptings of\r\nmagnificence, asked a favour of the Pope; who, expecting that he would\r\nask somewhat else than he did, liberally promised to give him whatever he\r\nshould demand. Whereupon:--\"Holy Father,\" quoth the abbot, \"that which I\r\nwould crave of you is that you restore Ghino di Tacco, my physician, to\r\nyour favour; seeing that among the good men and true and meritorious that\r\nI have known, he is by no means of the least account. And for the evil\r\nlife that he leads, I impute it to Fortune rather than to him: change\r\nthen his fortune, by giving him the means whereby he may live in manner\r\nbefitting his rank, and I doubt not that in a little while your judgment\r\nof him will jump with mine.\" Whereto the Pope, being magnanimous, and an\r\nadmirer of good men and true, made answer that so he would gladly do, if\r\nGhino should prove to be such as the abbot said; and that he would have\r\nhim brought under safe conduct to Rome. Thither accordingly under safe\r\nconduct came Ghino, to the abbot's great delight; nor had he been long at\r\ncourt before the Pope approved his worth, and restored him to his favour,\r\ngranting him a great office, to wit, that of prior of the Hospital,\r\nwhereof he made him knight. Which office he held for the rest of his\r\nlife, being ever a friend and vassal of Holy Church and the Abbot of\r\nCluny.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL III.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMitridanes, holding Nathan in despite by reason of his courtesy, journeys\r\nwith intent to kill him, and falling in with him unawares, is advised by\r\nhim how to compass his end. Following his advice, he finds him in a\r\ncopse, and recognizing him, is shame-stricken, and becomes his friend.\r\n--\r\n\r\nVerily like to a miracle seemed it to all to hear that a prelate had done\r\naught with magnificence; but when the ladies had made an end of their\r\nremarks, the king bade Filostrato follow suit; and forthwith Filostrato\r\nbegan:--Noble ladies, great was the magnificence of the King of Spain,\r\nand perchance a thing unheard-of the magnificence of the Abbot of Cluny;\r\nbut peradventure 'twill seem not a whit less marvellous to you to hear of\r\none who, to shew liberality towards another, did resolve artfully to\r\nyield to him his blood, nay, his very life, for which the other thirsted,\r\nand had so done, had the other chosen to take them, as I shall shew you\r\nin a little story.\r\n\r\nBeyond all question, if we may believe the report of certain Genoese, and\r\nother folk that have been in those regions, there dwelt of yore in the\r\nparts of Cathay one Nathan, a man of noble lineage and incomparable\r\nwealth. Who, having a seat hard by a road, by which whoso would travel\r\nfrom the West eastward, or from the East westward, must needs pass, and\r\nbeing magnanimous and liberal, and zealous to approve himself such in\r\nact, did set on work cunning artificers not a few, and cause one of the\r\nfinest and largest and most luxurious palaces that ever were seen, to be\r\nthere builded and furnished in the goodliest manner with all things meet\r\nfor the reception and honourable entertainment of gentlemen. And so,\r\nkeeping a great array of excellent servants, he courteously and\r\nhospitably did the honours of his house to whoso came and went: in which\r\nlaudable way of life he persevered, until not only the East, but\r\nwell-nigh all the West had heard his fame; which thus, what time he was\r\nwell-stricken in years, albeit not for that cause grown weary of shewing\r\ncourtesy, reached the ears of one Mitridanes, a young man of a country\r\nnot far distant. Who, knowing himself to be no less wealthy than Nathan,\r\ngrew envious of the renown that he had of his good deeds, and resolved to\r\nobliterate, or at least to obscure it, by a yet greater liberality. So he\r\nhad built for himself a palace like that of Nathan, of which he did the\r\nhonours with a lavish courtesy that none had ever equalled, to whoso came\r\nor went that way; and verily in a short while he became famous enough.\r\n\r\nNow it so befell that on a day when the young man was all alone in the\r\ncourtyard of the palace, there came in by one of the gates a poor woman,\r\nwho asked of him an alms, and had it; but, not content therewith, came\r\nagain to him by the second gate, and asked another alms, and had it, and\r\nafter the like sort did even unto the twelfth time; but, she returning\r\nfor the thirteenth time:--\"My good woman,\" quoth Mitridanes, \"thou art\r\nnot a little pertinacious in thy begging:\" howbeit he gave her an alms.\r\nWhereupon:--\"Ah! the wondrous liberality of Nathan!\" quoth the\r\nbeldam:--\"thirty-two gates are there to his palace, by every one of which\r\nI have entered, and asking alms of him, was never--for aught he\r\nshewed--recognized, or refused, and here, though I have entered as yet by\r\nbut thirteen gates, I am recognized and reprimanded.\" And therewith she\r\ndeparted, and returned no more. Mitridanes, who accounted the mention of\r\nNathan's fame an abatement of his own, was kindled by her words with a\r\nfrenzy of wrath, and began thus to commune with himself:--Alas! when\r\nshall I attain to the grandeur of Nathan's liberality, to say nought of\r\ntranscending it, as I would fain, seeing that in the veriest trifles I\r\ncannot approach him? Of a surety my labour is in vain, if I rid not the\r\nearth of him: which, since old age relieves me not of him, I must\r\nforthwith do with mine own hands. And in the flush of his despite up he\r\nstarted, and giving none to know of his purpose, got to horse with a\r\nsmall company, and after three days arrived at the place where Nathan\r\nabode; and having enjoined his comrades to make as if they were none of\r\nhis, and knew him not, and to go quarter themselves as best they might\r\nuntil they had his further orders, he, being thus alone, towards evening\r\ncame upon Nathan, also alone, at no great distance from his splendid\r\npalace. Nathan was recreating himself by a walk, and was very simply\r\nclad; so that Mitridanes, knowing him not, asked him if he could shew him\r\nwhere Nathan dwelt. \"My son,\" replied Nathan gladsomely, \"that can none\r\nin these parts better than I; wherefore, so it please thee, I will bring\r\nthee thither.\" The young man replied that 'twould be mighty agreeable to\r\nhim, but that, if so it might be, he had a mind to be neither known nor\r\nseen by Nathan. \"And herein also,\" returned Nathan, \"since 'tis thy\r\npleasure, I will gratify thee.\" Whereupon Mitridanes dismounted, and with\r\nNathan, who soon engaged him in delightsome discourse, walked to the\r\ngoodly palace. Arrived there Nathan caused one of his servants take the\r\nyoung man's horse, and drawing close to him, bade him in a whisper to see\r\nto it without delay that none in the house should tell the young man that\r\nhe was Nathan: and so 'twas done.\r\n\r\nBeing come into the palace, Nathan quartered Mitridanes in a most goodly\r\nchamber, where none saw him but those whom he had appointed to wait upon\r\nhim; and he himself kept him company, doing him all possible honour. Of\r\nwhom Mitridanes, albeit he reverenced him as a father, yet, being thus\r\nwith him, forbore not to ask who he was. Whereto Nathan made answer:--\"I\r\nam a petty servant of Nathan: old as I am, I have been with him since my\r\nchildhood, and never has he advanced me to higher office than this\r\nwherein thou seest me: wherefore, howsoever other folk may praise him,\r\nlittle cause have I to do so.\" Which words afforded Mitridanes some hope\r\nof carrying his wicked purpose into effect with more of plan and less of\r\nrisk than had otherwise been possible. By and by Nathan very courteously\r\nasked him who he was, and what business brought him thither; offering him\r\nsuch counsel and aid as he might be able to afford him. Mitridanes\r\nhesitated a while to reply: but at last he resolved to trust him, and\r\nwhen with no little circumlocution he had demanded of him fidelity,\r\ncounsel and aid, he fully discovered to him who he was, and the purpose\r\nand motive of his coming thither. Now, albeit to hear Mitridanes thus\r\nunfold his horrid design caused Nathan no small inward commotion, yet\r\n'twas not long before courageously and composedly he thus made\r\nanswer:--\"Noble was thy father, Mitridanes, and thou art minded to shew\r\nthyself not unworthy of him by this lofty emprise of thine, to wit, of\r\nbeing liberal to all comers: and for that thou art envious of Nathan's\r\nmerit I greatly commend thee; for were many envious for a like cause, the\r\nworld, from being a most wretched, would soon become a happy place. Doubt\r\nnot that I shall keep secret the design which thou hast confided to me,\r\nfor the furtherance whereof 'tis good advice rather than substantial aid\r\nthat I have to offer thee. Which advice is this. Hence, perhaps half a\r\nmile off, thou mayst see a copse, in which almost every morning Nathan is\r\nwont to walk, taking his pleasure, for quite a long while: 'twill be an\r\neasy matter for thee to find him there, and deal with him as thou mayst\r\nbe minded. Now, shouldst thou slay him, thou wilt get thee home with less\r\nrisk of let, if thou take not the path by which thou camest hither, but\r\nthat which thou seest issue from the copse on the left, for, though 'tis\r\nsomewhat more rough, it leads more directly to thy house, and will be\r\nsafer for thee.\"\r\n\r\nPossessed of this information, Mitridanes, when Nathan had left him,\r\nprivily apprised his comrades, who were likewise lodged in the palace, of\r\nthe place where they were to await him on the ensuing day; which being\r\ncome, Nathan, inflexibly determined to act in all respects according to\r\nthe advice which he had given Mitridanes, hied him forth to the copse\r\nunattended, to meet his death. Mitridanes, being risen, took his bow and\r\nsword, for other arms he had none with him, mounted his horse, and rode\r\nto the copse, through which, while he was yet some way off, he saw Nathan\r\npassing, quite alone. And being minded, before he fell upon him, to see\r\nhis face and hear the sound of his voice, as, riding at a smart pace, he\r\ncame up with him, he laid hold of him by his head-gear,\r\nexclaiming:--\"Greybeard, thou art a dead man.\" Whereto Nathan answered\r\nnought but:--\"Then 'tis but my desert.\" But Mitridanes, hearing the\r\nvoice, and scanning the face, forthwith knew him for the same man that\r\nhad welcomed him heartily, consorted with him familiarly, and counselled\r\nhim faithfully; whereby his wrath presently subsided, and gave place to\r\nshame. Wherefore, casting away the sword that he held drawn in act to\r\nstrike, he sprang from his horse, and weeping, threw himself at Nathan's\r\nfeet, saying:--\"Your liberality, dearest father, I acknowledge to be\r\nbeyond all question, seeing with what craft you did plot your coming\r\nhither to yield me your life, for which, by mine own avowal, you knew\r\nthat I, albeit cause I had none, did thirst. But God, more regardful of\r\nmy duty than I myself, has now, in this moment of supreme stress, opened\r\nthe eyes of my mind, that wretched envy had fast sealed. The prompter was\r\nyour compliance, the greater is the debt of penitence that I owe you for\r\nmy fault; wherefore wreak even such vengeance upon me as you may deem\r\nanswerable to my transgression.\" But Nathan raised Mitridanes to his\r\nfeet, and tenderly embraced him, saying:--\"My son, thy enterprise,\r\nhowsoever thou mayst denote it, whether evil or otherwise, was not such\r\nthat thou shouldst crave, or I give, pardon thereof; for 'twas not in\r\nmalice but in that thou wouldst fain have been reputed better than I that\r\nthou ensuedst it. Doubt then no more of me; nay, rest assured that none\r\nthat lives bears thee such love as I, who know the loftiness of thy\r\nspirit, bent not to heap up wealth, as do the caitiffs, but to dispense\r\nin bounty thine accumulated store. Think it no shame that to enhance thy\r\nreputation thou wouldst have slain me; nor deem that I marvel thereat. To\r\nslay not one man, as thou wast minded, but countless multitudes, to waste\r\nwhole countries with fire, and to raze cities to the ground has been\r\nwell-nigh the sole art, by which the mightiest emperors and the greatest\r\nkings have extended their dominions, and by consequence their fame.\r\nWherefore, if thou, to increase thy fame, wouldst fain have slain me,\r\n'twas nothing marvellous or strange, but wonted.\"\r\n\r\nWhereto Mitridanes made answer, not to excuse his wicked design, but to\r\ncommend the seemly excuse found for it by Nathan, whom at length he told\r\nhow beyond measure he marvelled that Nathan had not only been consenting\r\nto the enterprise, but had aided him therein by his counsel. But Nathan\r\nanswered:--\"Liefer had I, Mitridanes, that thou didst not marvel either\r\nat my consent or at my counsel, for that, since I was my own master and\r\nof a mind to that emprise whereon thou art also bent, never a soul came\r\nto my house, but, so far as in me lay, I gave him all that he asked of\r\nme. Thou camest, lusting for my life; and so, when I heard thee crave it\r\nof me, I forthwith, that thou mightst not be the only guest to depart\r\nhence ill content, resolved to give it thee; and to that end I gave thee\r\nsuch counsel as I deemed would serve thee both to the taking of my life\r\nand the preservation of thine own. Wherefore yet again I bid thee, nay, I\r\nentreat thee, if so thou art minded, to take it for thy satisfaction: I\r\nknow not how I could better bestow it. I have had the use of it now for\r\nsome eighty years, and pleasure and solace thereof; and I know that, by\r\nthe course of Nature and the common lot of man and all things mundane, it\r\ncan continue to be mine for but a little while; and so I deem that 'twere\r\nmuch better to bestow it, as I have ever bestowed and dispensed my\r\nwealth, than to keep it, until, against my will, it be reft from me by\r\nNature. 'Twere but a trifle, though 'twere a hundred years: how\r\ninsignificant, then, the six or eight years that are all I have to give!\r\nTake it, then, if thou hadst lief, take it, I pray thee; for, long as I\r\nhave lived here, none have I found but thee to desire it; nor know I when\r\nI may find another, if thou take it not, to demand it of me. And if,\r\nperadventure, I should find one such, yet I know that the longer I keep\r\nit, the less its worth will be; wherefore, ere it be thus cheapened, take\r\nit, I implore thee.\"\r\n\r\nSore shame-stricken, Mitridanes made answer:--\"Now God forefend that I\r\nshould so much as harbour, as but now I did, such a thought, not to say\r\ndo such a deed, as to wrest from you a thing so precious as your life,\r\nthe years whereof, so far from abridging, I would gladly supplement with\r\nmine own.\" \"So then,\" rejoined Nathan promptly, \"thou wouldst, if thou\r\ncouldst, add thy years to mine, and cause me to serve thee as I never yet\r\nserved any man, to wit, to take from thee that which is thine, I that\r\nnever took aught from a soul!\" \"Ay, that would I,\" returned Mitridanes.\r\n\"Then,\" quoth Nathan, \"do as I shall bid thee. Thou art young: tarry here\r\nin my house, and call thyself Nathan; and I will get me to thy house, and\r\never call myself Mitridanes.\" Whereto Mitridanes made answer:--\"Were I\r\nbut able to discharge this trust, as you have been and are, scarce would\r\nI hesitate to accept your offer; but, as too sure am I that aught that I\r\nmight do would but serve to lower Nathan's fame, and I am not minded to\r\nmar that in another which I cannot mend in myself, accept it I will not.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which and the like interchange of delectable discourse, Nathan and\r\nMitridanes, by Nathan's desire, returned to the palace; where Nathan for\r\nsome days honourably entreated Mitridanes, and by his sage counsel\r\nconfirmed and encouraged him in his high and noble resolve; after which,\r\nMitridanes, being minded to return home with his company, took his leave\r\nof Nathan, fully persuaded that 'twas not possible to surpass him in\r\nliberality.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IV.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMesser Gentile de' Carisendi, being come from Modena, disinters a lady\r\nthat he loves, who has been buried for dead. She, being reanimated, gives\r\nbirth to a male child; and Messer Gentile restores her, with her son, to\r\nNiccoluccio Caccianimico, her husband.\r\n--\r\n\r\nA thing marvellous seemed it to all that for liberality a man should be\r\nready to sacrifice his own life; and herein they averred that Nathan had\r\nwithout doubt left the King of Spain and the Abbot of Cluny behind.\r\nHowever, when they had discussed the matter diversely and at large, the\r\nking, bending his regard on Lauretta, signified to her his will that she\r\nshould tell; and forthwith, accordingly, Lauretta began:--Goodly matters\r\nare they and magnificent that have been recounted to you, young ladies;\r\nnay, so much of our field of discourse is already filled by their\r\ngrandeur, that for us that are yet to tell, there is, methinks, no room\r\nleft, unless we seek our topic there where matter of discourse germane to\r\nevery theme does most richly abound, to wit, in the affairs of love. For\r\nwhich cause, as also for that our time of life cannot but make us\r\nespecially inclinable thereto, I am minded that my story shall be of a\r\nfeat of magnificence done by a lover: which, all things considered, will,\r\nperadventure, seem to you inferior to none that have been shewn you; so\r\nit be true that to possess the beloved one, men will part with their\r\ntreasures, forget their enmities, and jeopardize their own lives, their\r\nhonour and their reputation, in a thousand ways.\r\n\r\nKnow, then, that at Bologna, that most famous city of Lombardy, there\r\ndwelt a knight, Messer Gentile Carisendi by name, worshipful alike for\r\nhis noble lineage and his native worth: who in his youth, being enamoured\r\nof a young gentlewoman named Madonna Catalina, wife of one Niccoluccio\r\nCaccianimico, and well-nigh despairing, for that the lady gave him but a\r\nsorry requital of his love, betook him to Modena, being called thither as\r\nPodesta. Now what time he was there, Niccoluccio being also away from\r\nBologna, and his lady gone, for that she was with child, to lie in at a\r\nhouse she had some three miles or so from the city, it befell that she\r\nwas suddenly smitten with a sore malady of such and so virulent a quality\r\nthat it left no sign of life in her, so that the very physicians\r\npronounced her dead. And for that the women that were nearest of kin to\r\nher professed to have been told by her, that she was not so far gone in\r\npregnancy that the child could be perfectly formed, they, without more\r\nado, laid her in a tomb in a neighbouring church, and after long\r\nlamentation closed it upon her.\r\n\r\nWhereof Messer Gentile being forthwith apprised by one of his friends,\r\ndid, for all she had been most niggardly to him of her favour, grieve not\r\na little, and at length fell a communing with himself on this wise:--So,\r\nMadonna Catalina, thou art dead! While thou livedst, never a glance of\r\nthine might I have; wherefore, now that thou art dead, 'tis but right\r\nthat I go take a kiss from thee. 'Twas night while he thus mused; and\r\nforthwith, observing strict secrecy in his departure, he got him to horse\r\nwith a single servant, and halted not until he was come to the place\r\nwhere the lady was interred; and having opened the tomb he cautiously\r\nentered it. Then, having lain down beside her, he set his face against\r\nhers; and again and again, weeping profusely the while, he kissed it. But\r\nas 'tis matter of common knowledge that the desires of men, and more\r\nespecially of lovers, know no bounds, but crave ever an ampler\r\nsatisfaction; even so Messer Gentile, albeit he had been minded to tarry\r\nthere no longer, now said to himself:--Wherefore touch I not her bosom a\r\nwhile? I have never yet touched it, nor shall I ever touch it again.\r\nObeying which impulse, he laid his hand on her bosom, and keeping it\r\nthere some time, felt, as he thought, her heart faintly beating.\r\nWhereupon, banishing all fear, and examining the body with closer\r\nattention, he discovered that life was not extinct, though he judged it\r\nbut scant and flickering: and so, aided by his servant, he bore her, as\r\ngently as he might, out of the tomb; and set her before him upon his\r\nhorse, and brought her privily to his house at Bologna, where dwelt his\r\nwise and worthy mother, who, being fully apprised by him of the\r\ncircumstances, took pity on the lady, and had a huge fire kindled, and a\r\nbath made ready, whereby she restored her to life. Whereof the first sign\r\nshe gave was to heave a great sigh, and murmur:--\"Alas! where am I?\" To\r\nwhich the worthy lady made answer:--\"Be of good cheer; thou art well\r\nlodged.\" By and by the lady, coming to herself, looked about her; and\r\nfinding herself she knew not where, and seeing Messer Gentile before her,\r\nwas filled with wonder, and besought his mother to tell her how she came\r\nto be there.\r\n\r\nMesser Gentile thereupon told her all. Sore distressed thereat, the lady,\r\nafter a while, thanked him as best she might; after which she besought\r\nhim by the love that he had borne her, and of his courtesy, that she\r\nmight, while she tarried in his house, be spared aught that could impair\r\nher honour and her husband's; and that at daybreak he would suffer her to\r\nreturn home. \"Madam,\" replied Messer Gentile, \"however I did affect you\r\nin time past, since God in His goodness has, by means of the love I bore\r\nyou, restored you to me alive, I mean not now, or at any time hereafter,\r\nto entreat you either here or elsewhere, save as a dear sister; but yet\r\nthe service I have to-night rendered you merits some guerdon, and\r\ntherefore lief had I that you deny me not a favour which I shall ask of\r\nyou.\" Whereto the lady graciously made answer that she would be prompt to\r\ngrant it, so only it were in her power, and consonant with her honour.\r\nSaid then Messer Gentile:--\"Your kinsfolk, Madam, one and all, nay, all\r\nthe folk in Bologna are fully persuaded that you are dead: there is\r\ntherefore none to expect you at home: wherefore the favour I crave of you\r\nis this, that you will be pleased to tarry privily here with my mother,\r\nuntil such time--which will be speedily--as I return from Modena. And\r\n'tis for that I purpose to make solemn and joyous donation of you to your\r\nhusband in presence of the most honourable folk of this city that I ask\r\nof you this grace.\" Mindful of what she owed the knight, and witting that\r\nwhat he craved was seemly, the lady, albeit she yearned not a little to\r\ngladden her kinsfolk with the sight of her in the flesh, consented to do\r\nas Messer Gentile besought her, and thereto pledged him her faith. And\r\nscarce had she done so, when she felt that the hour of her travail was\r\ncome; and so, tenderly succoured by Messer Gentile's mother, she not long\r\nafter gave birth to a fine boy. Which event did mightily enhance her own\r\nand Messer Gentile's happiness. Then, having made all meet provision for\r\nher, and left word that she was to be tended as if she were his own wife,\r\nMesser Gentile, observing strict secrecy, returned to Modena.\r\n\r\nHis time of office there ended, in anticipation of his return to Bologna,\r\nhe appointed for the morning of his arrival in the city a great and\r\ngoodly banquet at his house, whereto were bidden not a few of the\r\ngentlemen of Bologna, and among them Niccoluccio Caccianimico. Whom, when\r\nhe was returned and dismounted, he found awaiting him, as also the lady,\r\nfairer and more healthful than ever, and her little son doing well; and\r\nso with a gladness beyond compare he ranged his guests at table, and\r\nregaled them with many a course magnificently served. And towards the\r\nclose of the feast, having premonished the lady of his intention, and\r\nconcerted with her how she should behave, thus he spoke:--\"Gentlemen, I\r\nmind me to have once heard tell of (as I deem it) a delightsome custom\r\nwhich they have in Persia; to wit, that, when one would do his friend\r\nespecial honour, he bids him to his house, and there shews him that\r\ntreasure, be it wife, or mistress, or daughter, or what not, that he\r\nholds most dear; assuring him that yet more gladly, were it possible, he\r\nwould shew him his heart. Which custom I am minded to observe here in\r\nBologna. You, of your courtesy, have honoured my feast with your\r\npresence, and I propose to do you honour in the Persian fashion, by\r\nshewing you that which in all the world I do, and must ever, hold most\r\ndear. But before I do so, tell me, I pray you, how you conceive of a nice\r\nquestion that I shall lay before you. Suppose that one has in his house a\r\ngood and most faithful servant, who falls sick of a grievous disorder;\r\nand that the master tarries not for the death of the servant, but has him\r\nborne out into the open street, and concerns himself no more with him:\r\nthat then a stranger comes by, is moved to pity of the sick man, and\r\ntakes him to his house, and by careful tendance and at no small cost\r\nrestores him to his wonted health. Now I would fain know whether the\r\nfirst master has in equity any just cause to complain of or be aggrieved\r\nwith the second master, if he retain the servant in his employ, and\r\nrefuse to restore him, when so required.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen discussed the matter after divers fashions, and all agreed\r\nin one sentence, which they committed to Niccoluccio Caccianimico, for\r\nthat he was an eloquent and accomplished speaker, to deliver on the part\r\nof them all. Niccoluccio began by commending the Persian custom: after\r\nwhich he said that he and the others were all of the same opinion, to\r\nwit, that the first master had no longer any right in his servant, since\r\nhe had not only abandoned but cast him forth; and that by virtue of the\r\nsecond master's kind usage of him he must be deemed to have become his\r\nservant; wherefore, by keeping him, he did the first master no mischief,\r\nno violence, no wrong. Whereupon the rest that were at the table said,\r\none and all, being worthy men, that their judgment jumped with\r\nNiccoluccio's answer. The knight, well pleased with the answer, and that\r\n'twas Niccoluccio that gave it, affirmed that he was of the same opinion;\r\nadding:--\"'Tis now time that I shew you that honour which I promised\r\nyou.\" He then called two of his servants, and sent them to the lady, whom\r\nhe had caused to be apparelled and adorned with splendour, charging them\r\nto pray her to be pleased to come and gladden the gentlemen with her\r\npresence. So she, bearing in her arms her most lovely little son, came,\r\nattended by the two servants, into the saloon, and by the knight's\r\ndirection, took a seat beside a worthy gentleman:\r\nwhereupon:--\"Gentlemen,\" quoth the knight, \"this is the treasure that I\r\nhold, and mean ever to hold, more dear than aught else. Behold, and judge\r\nwhether I have good cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen said not a little in her honour and praise, averring that\r\nthe knight ought indeed to hold her dear: then, as they regarded her more\r\nattentively, there were not a few that would have pronounced her to be\r\nthe very woman that she was, had they not believed that woman to be dead.\r\nBut none scanned her so closely as Niccoluccio, who, the knight being\r\nwithdrawn a little space, could no longer refrain his eager desire to\r\nknow who she might be, but asked her whether she were of Bologna, or from\r\nother parts. The lady, hearing her husband's voice, could scarce forbear\r\nto answer; but yet, not to disconcert the knight's plan, she kept\r\nsilence. Another asked her if that was her little boy; and yet another,\r\nif she were Messer Gentile's wife, or in any other wise his connection.\r\nTo none of whom she vouchsafed an answer. Then, Messer Gentile coming\r\nup:--\"Sir,\" quoth one of the guests, \"this treasure of yours is goodly\r\nindeed; but she seems to be dumb: is she so?\" \"Gentlemen,\" quoth Messer\r\nGentile, \"that she has not as yet spoken is no small evidence of her\r\nvirtue.\" \"Then tell us, you, who she is,\" returned the other. \"That,\"\r\nquoth the knight, \"will I right gladly, so you but promise me, that, no\r\nmatter what I may say, none of you will stir from his place, until I have\r\nended my story.\" All gave the required promise, and when the tables had\r\nbeen cleared, Messer Gentile, being seated beside the lady, thus\r\nspoke:--\"Gentlemen, this lady is that loyal and faithful servant,\r\ntouching whom a brief while ago I propounded to you my question, whom her\r\nown folk held none too dear, but cast out into the open street as a thing\r\nvile and no longer good for aught, but I took thence, and by my careful\r\ntendance wrested from the clutch of death; whom God, regardful of my good\r\nwill, has changed from the appalling aspect of a corpse to the thing of\r\nbeauty that you see before you. But for your fuller understanding of this\r\noccurrence, I will briefly explain it to you.\" He then recounted to them\r\nin detail all that had happened from his first becoming enamoured of the\r\nlady to that very hour whereto they hearkened with no small wonder; after\r\nwhich:--\"And so,\" he added, \"unless you, and more especially Niccoluccio,\r\nare now of another opinion than you were a brief while ago, the lady\r\nrightly belongs to me, nor can any man lawfully reclaim her of me.\"\r\n\r\nNone answered, for all were intent to hear what more he would say. But,\r\nwhile Niccoluccio, and some others that were there, wept for sympathy,\r\nMesser Gentile stood up, and took the little boy in his arms and the lady\r\nby the hand, and approached Niccoluccio, saying:--\"Rise, my gossip: I do\r\nnot, indeed, restore thee thy wife, whom thy kinsfolk and hers cast\r\nforth; but I am minded to give thee this lady, my gossip, with this her\r\nlittle boy, whom I know well to be thy son, and whom I held at the font,\r\nand named Gentile: and I pray thee that she be not the less dear to thee\r\nfor that she has tarried three months in my house; for I swear to thee by\r\nthat God, who, peradventure, ordained that I should be enamoured of her,\r\nto the end that my love might be, as it has been, the occasion of her\r\nrestoration to life, that never with her father, or her mother, or with\r\nthee, did she live more virtuously than with my mother in my house.\"\r\nWhich said, he turned to the lady, saying:--\"Madam, I now release you\r\nfrom all promises made to me, and so deliver you to Niccoluccio.\" Then,\r\nleaving the lady and the child in Niccoluccio's embrace, he returned to\r\nhis seat.\r\n\r\nThus to receive his wife and son was to Niccoluccio a delight great in\r\nthe measure of its remoteness from his hope. Wherefore in the most\r\nhonourable terms at his command he thanked the knight, whom all the rest,\r\nweeping for sympathy, greatly commended for what he had done, as did also\r\nall that heard thereof. The lady, welcomed home with wondrous cheer, was\r\nlong a portent to the Bolognese, who gazed on her as on one raised from\r\nthe dead. Messer Gentile lived ever after as the friend of Niccoluccio,\r\nand his and the lady's kinsfolk.\r\n\r\nNow what shall be your verdict, gracious ladies? A king's largess, though\r\nit was of his sceptre and crown, an abbot's reconciliation, at no cost to\r\nhimself, of a malefactor with the Pope, or an old man's submission of his\r\nthroat to the knife of his enemy--will you adjudge that such acts as\r\nthese are comparable to the deed of Messer Gentile? Who, though young,\r\nand burning with passion, and deeming himself justly entitled to that\r\nwhich the heedlessness of another had discarded, and he by good fortune\r\nhad recovered, not only tempered his ardour with honour, but having that\r\nwhich with his whole soul he had long been bent on wresting from another,\r\ndid with liberality restore it. Assuredly none of the feats aforesaid\r\nseem to me like unto this.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL V.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMadonna Dianora craves of Messer Ansaldo a garden that shall be as fair\r\nin January as in May. Messer Ansaldo binds himself to a necromancer, and\r\nthereby gives her the garden. Her husband gives her leave to do Messer\r\nAnsaldo's pleasure: he, being apprised of her husband's liberality,\r\nreleases her from her promise; and the necromancer releases Messer\r\nAnsaldo from his bond, and will take nought of his.\r\n--\r\n\r\nEach of the gay company had with superlative commendation extolled Messer\r\nGentile to the skies, when the king bade Emilia follow suit; and with a\r\ngood courage, as burning to speak, thus Emilia began:--Delicate my\r\nladies, none can justly say that 'twas not magnificently done of Messer\r\nGentile; but if it be alleged that 'twas the last degree of magnificence,\r\n'twill perchance not be difficult to shew that more was possible, as is\r\nmy purpose in the little story that I shall tell you.\r\n\r\nIn Friuli, a country which, though its air is shrewd, is pleasantly\r\ndiversified by fine mountains and not a few rivers and clear fountains,\r\nis a city called Udine, where dwelt of yore a fair and noble lady,\r\nMadonna Dianora by name, wife of a wealthy grandee named Giliberto, a\r\nvery pleasant gentleman, and debonair. Now this lady, for her high\r\nqualities, was in the last degree beloved by a great and noble baron,\r\nMesser Ansaldo Gradense by name, a man of no little consequence, and\r\nwhose fame for feats of arms and courtesy was spread far and wide. But,\r\nthough with all a lover's ardour he left nought undone that he might do\r\nto win her love, and to that end frequently plied her with his\r\nambassages, 'twas all in vain. And the lady being distressed by his\r\nimportunity, and that, refuse as she might all that he asked of her, he\r\nnone the less continued to love her and press his suit upon her,\r\nbethought her how she might rid herself of him by requiring of him an\r\nextraordinary and, as she deemed, impossible feat. So one day, a woman\r\nthat came oftentimes from him to her being with her:--\"Good woman,\" quoth\r\nshe, \"thou hast many a time affirmed that Messer Ansaldo loves me above\r\nall else; and thou hast made proffer to me on his part of wondrous rich\r\ngifts which I am minded he keep to himself, for that I could never bring\r\nmyself to love him or pleasure him for their sake; but, if I might be\r\ncertified that he loves me as much as thou sayst, then without a doubt I\r\nshould not fail to love him, and do his pleasure; wherefore, so he give\r\nme the assurance that I shall require, I shall be at his command.\" \"What\r\nis it, Madam,\" returned the good woman, \"that you would have him do?\"\r\n\"This,\" replied the lady; \"I would have this next ensuing January, hard\r\nby this city, a garden full of green grass and flowers and flowering\r\ntrees, just as if it were May; and if he cannot provide me with this\r\ngarden, bid him never again send either thee or any other to me, for\r\nthat, should he harass me any further, I shall no longer keep silence, as\r\nI have hitherto done, but shall make my complaint to my husband and all\r\nmy kinsmen, and it shall go hard but I will be quit of him.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman being apprised of his lady's stipulation and promise,\r\nnotwithstanding that he deemed it no easy matter, nay, a thing almost\r\nimpossible, to satisfy her, and knew besides that 'twas but to deprive\r\nhim of all hope that she made the demand, did nevertheless resolve to do\r\nhis endeavour to comply with it, and causing search to be made in divers\r\nparts of the world, if any he might find to afford him counsel or aid, he\r\nlit upon one, who for a substantial reward offered to do the thing by\r\nnecromancy. So Messer Ansaldo, having struck the bargain with him for an\r\nexceeding great sum of money, gleefully expected the appointed time.\r\nWhich being come with extreme cold, insomuch that there was nought but\r\nsnow and ice, the adept on the night before the calends of January\r\nwrought with his spells to such purpose that on the morrow, as was\r\naverred by eye-witnesses, there appeared in a meadow hard by the city one\r\nof the most beautiful gardens that was ever seen, with no lack of grass\r\nand trees and fruits of all sorts. At sight whereof Messer Ansaldo was\r\noverjoyed, and caused some of the finest fruits and flowers that it\r\ncontained to be gathered, and privily presented to his lady, whom he bade\r\ncome and see the garden that she had craved, that thereby she might have\r\nassurance of his love, and mind her of the promise that she had given him\r\nand confirmed with an oath, and, as a loyal lady, take thought for its\r\nperformance. When she saw the flowers and fruits, the lady, who had\r\nalready heard not a few folk speak of the wondrous garden, began to\r\nrepent her of her promise. But for all that, being fond of strange\r\nsights, she hied her with many other ladies of the city to see the\r\ngarden, and having gazed on it with wonderment, and commended it not a\r\nlittle, she went home the saddest woman alive, bethinking her to what it\r\nbound her: and so great was her distress that she might not well conceal\r\nit; but, being written on her face, 'twas marked by her husband, who was\r\nminded by all means to know the cause thereof.\r\n\r\nThe lady long time kept silence: but at last she yielded to his urgency,\r\nand discovered to him the whole matter from first to last. Whereat\r\nGiliberto was at first very wroth; but on second thoughts, considering\r\nthe purity of the lady's purpose, he was better advised, and dismissing\r\nhis anger:--\"Dianora,\" quoth he, \"'tis not the act of a discreet or\r\nvirtuous lady to give ear to messages of such a sort, nor to enter into\r\nany compact touching her chastity with any man on any terms. Words that\r\nthe ears convey to the heart have a potency greater than is commonly\r\nsupposed, and there is scarce aught that lovers will not find possible.\r\n'Twas then ill done of thee in the first instance to hearken, as\r\nafterwards to make the compact; but, for that I know the purity of thy\r\nsoul, that thou mayst be quit of thy promise, I will grant thee that\r\nwhich, perchance, no other man would grant, being also swayed thereto by\r\nfear of the necromancer, whom Messer Ansaldo, shouldst thou play him\r\nfalse, might, peradventure, cause to do us a mischief. I am minded, then,\r\nthat thou go to him, and contrive, if on any wise thou canst, to get thee\r\nquit of this promise without loss of virtue; but if otherwise it may not\r\nbe, then for the nonce thou mayst yield him thy body, but not thy soul.\"\r\nWhereat the lady, weeping, would none of such a favour at her husband's\r\nhands. But Giliberto, for all the lady's protestations, was minded that\r\nso it should be.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the morrow about dawn, apparelled none too ornately,\r\npreceded by two servants and followed by a chambermaid, the lady hied her\r\nto Messer Ansaldo's house. Apprised that his lady was come to see him,\r\nMesser Ansaldo, marvelling not a little, rose, and having called the\r\nnecromancer:--\"I am minded,\" quoth he, \"that thou see what goodly gain I\r\nhave gotten by thine art.\" And the twain having met the lady, Ansaldo\r\ngave way to no unruly appetite, but received her with a seemly obeisance;\r\nand then the three repaired to a goodly chamber, where there was a great\r\nfire, and having caused the lady to be seated, thus spoke\r\nAnsaldo:--\"Madam, if the love that I have so long borne you merit any\r\nguerdon, I pray you that it be not grievous to you to discover to me the\r\ntrue occasion of your coming to me at this hour, and thus accompanied.\"\r\nShamefast, and the tears all but standing in her eyes, the lady made\r\nanswer:--\"Sir 'tis neither love that I bear you, nor pledged you, that\r\nbrings me hither, but the command of my husband, who, regarding rather\r\nthe pains you have had of your unbridled passion than his own or my\r\nhonour, has sent me hither; and for that he commands it, I, for the\r\nnonce, am entirely at your pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nIf Messer Ansaldo had marvelled to hear of the lady's coming, he now\r\nmarvelled much more, and touched by Giliberto's liberality, and passing\r\nfrom passion to compassion:--\"Now, God forbid, Madam,\" quoth he, \"that,\r\nit being as you say, I should wound the honour of him that has compassion\r\non my love; wherefore, no otherwise than as if you were my sister shall\r\nyou abide here, while you are so minded, and be free to depart at your\r\npleasure; nor crave I aught of you but that you shall convey from me to\r\nyour husband such thanks as you shall deem meet for courtesy such as his\r\nhas been, and entreat me ever henceforth as your brother and servant.\"\r\nWhereat overjoyed in the last degree:--\"Nought,\" quoth the lady, \"by what\r\nI noted of your behaviour, could ever have caused me to anticipate other\r\nsequel of my coming hither than this which I see is your will, and for\r\nwhich I shall ever be your debtor.\" She then took her leave, and,\r\nattended by a guard of honour, returned to Giliberto, and told him what\r\nhad passed; between whom and Messer Ansaldo there was thenceforth a most\r\nclose and loyal friendship.\r\n\r\nNow the liberality shewn by Giliberto towards Messer Ansaldo, and by\r\nMesser Ansaldo towards the lady, having been marked by the necromancer,\r\nwhen Messer Ansaldo made ready to give him the promised reward:--\"Now God\r\nforbid,\" quoth he, \"that, as I have seen Giliberto liberal in regard of\r\nhis honour, and you liberal in regard of your love, I be not in like\r\nmanner liberal in regard of my reward, which accordingly, witting that\r\n'tis in good hands, I am minded that you keep.\" The knight was abashed,\r\nand strove hard to induce him to take, if not the whole, at least a part\r\nof the money; but finding that his labour was in vain, and that the\r\nnecromancer, having caused his garden to vanish after the third day, was\r\nminded to depart, he bade him adieu. And the carnal love he had borne the\r\nlady being spent, he burned for her thereafter with a flame of honourable\r\naffection. Now what shall be our verdict in this case, lovesome ladies? A\r\nlady, as it were dead, and a love grown lukewarm for utter hopelessness!\r\nShall we set a liberality shewn in such a case above this liberality of\r\nMesser Ansaldo, loving yet as ardently, and hoping, perchance, yet more\r\nardently than ever, and holding in his hands the prize that he had so\r\nlong pursued? Folly indeed should I deem it to compare that liberality\r\nwith this.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VI.\r\n\r\n--\r\nKing Charles the Old, being conqueror, falls in love with a young maiden,\r\nand afterward growing ashamed of his folly bestows her and her sister\r\nhonourably in marriage.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWho might fully recount with what diversity of argument the ladies\r\ndebated which of the three, Giliberto, or Messer Ansaldo, or the\r\nnecromancer, behaved with the most liberality in the affair of Madonna\r\nDianora? Too long were it to tell. However, when the king had allowed\r\nthem to dispute a while, he, with a glance at Fiammetta, bade her rescue\r\nthem from their wrangling by telling her story. Fiammetta made no demur,\r\nbut thus began:--Illustrious my ladies, I have ever been of opinion that\r\nin companies like ours one should speak so explicitly that the import of\r\nwhat is said should never by excessive circumscription afford matter for\r\ndisputation; which is much more in place among students in the schools,\r\nthan among us, whose powers are scarce adequate to the management of the\r\ndistaff and the spindle. Wherefore I, that had in mind a matter of,\r\nperchance, some nicety, now that I see you all at variance touching the\r\nmatters last mooted, am minded to lay it aside, and tell you somewhat\r\nelse, which concerns a man by no means of slight account, but a valiant\r\nking, being a chivalrous action that he did, albeit in no wise thereto\r\nactuated by his honour.\r\n\r\nThere is none of you but may not seldom have heard tell of King Charles\r\nthe Old, or the First, by whose magnificent emprise, and the ensuing\r\nvictory gained over King Manfred, the Ghibellines were driven forth of\r\nFlorence, and the Guelfs returned thither. For which cause a knight,\r\nMesser Neri degli Uberti by name, departing Florence with his household\r\nand not a little money, resolved to fix his abode under no other sway\r\nthan that of King Charles. And being fain of a lonely place in which to\r\nend his days in peace, he betook him to Castello da Mare di Stabia; and\r\nthere, perchance a cross-bow-shot from the other houses of the place,\r\namid the olives and hazels and chestnuts that abound in those parts, he\r\nbought an estate, on which he built a goodly house and commodious, with a\r\npleasant garden beside it, in the midst of which, having no lack of\r\nrunning water, he set, after our Florentine fashion, a pond fair and\r\nclear, and speedily filled it with fish. And while thus he lived, daily\r\noccupying himself with nought else but how to make his garden more fair,\r\nit befell that King Charles in the hot season betook him to Castello da\r\nMare to refresh himself a while, and hearing of the beauty of Messer\r\nNeri's garden, was desirous to view it. And having learned to whom it\r\nbelonged, he bethought him that, as the knight was an adherent of the\r\nparty opposed to him, he would use more familiarity towards him than he\r\nwould otherwise have done; and so he sent him word that he and four\r\ncomrades would sup privily with him in his garden on the ensuing evening.\r\nMesser Neri felt himself much honoured; and having made his preparations\r\nwith magnificence, and arranged the order of the ceremonies with his\r\nhousehold, did all he could and knew to make the King cordially welcome\r\nto his fair garden.\r\n\r\nWhen the King had viewed the garden throughout, as also Messer Neri's\r\nhouse, and commended them, he washed, and seated himself at one of the\r\ntables, which were set beside the pond, and bade Count Guy de Montfort,\r\nwho was one of his companions, sit on one side of him, and Messer Neri on\r\nthe other, and the other three to serve, as they should be directed by\r\nMesser Neri. The dishes that were set before them were dainty, the wines\r\nexcellent and rare, the order of the repast very fair and commendable,\r\nwithout the least noise or aught else that might distress; whereon the\r\nKing bestowed no stinted praise. As thus he gaily supped, well-pleased\r\nwith the lovely spot, there came into the garden two young maidens, each\r\nperhaps fifteen years old, blonde both, their golden tresses falling all\r\nin ringlets about them, and crowned with a dainty garland of\r\nperiwinkle-flowers; and so delicate and fair of face were they that they\r\nshewed liker to angels than aught else, each clad in a robe of finest\r\nlinen, white as snow upon their flesh, close-fitting as might be from the\r\nwaist up, but below the waist ample, like a pavilion to the feet. She\r\nthat was foremost bore on her shoulders a pair of nets, which she held\r\nwith her left hand, carrying in her right a long pole. Her companion\r\nfollowed, bearing on her left shoulder a frying-pan, under her left arm a\r\nbundle of faggots, and in her left hand a tripod, while in the other hand\r\nshe carried a cruse of oil and a lighted taper. At sight of whom the King\r\nmarvelled, and gazed intent to learn what it might import. The two young\r\nmaidens came forward with becoming modesty, and did obeisance to the\r\nKing; which done they hied them to the place of ingress to the pond, and\r\nshe that had the frying-pan having set it down, and afterward the other\r\nthings, took the pole that the other carried, and so they both went down\r\ninto the pond, being covered by its waters to their breasts. Whereupon\r\none of Messer Neri's servants, having forthwith lit a fire, and set the\r\ntripod on the faggots and oil therein, addressed himself to wait, until\r\nsome fish should be thrown to him by the girls. Who, the one searching\r\nwith the pole in those parts where she knew the fish lay hid, while the\r\nother made ready the nets, did in a brief space of time, to the exceeding\r\ngreat delight of the King, who watched them attentively, catch fish not a\r\nfew, which they tossed to the servant, who set them, before the life was\r\nwell out of them, in the frying-pan. After which, the maidens, as\r\npre-arranged, addressed them to catch some of the finest fish, and cast\r\nthem on to the table before the King, and Count Guy, and their father.\r\nThe fish wriggled about the table to the prodigious delight of the King,\r\nwho in like manner took some of them, and courteously returned them to\r\nthe girls; with which sport they diverted them, until the servant had\r\ncooked the fish that had been given him: which, by Messer Neri's command,\r\nwere set before the King rather as a side-dish than as aught very rare or\r\ndelicious.\r\n\r\nWhen the girls saw that all the fish were cooked, and that there was no\r\noccasion for them to catch any more, they came forth of the pond, their\r\nfine white garments cleaving everywhere close to their flesh so as to\r\nhide scarce any part of their delicate persons, took up again the things\r\nthat they had brought, and passing modestly before the King, returned to\r\nthe house. The King, and the Count, and the other gentlemen that waited,\r\nhad regarded the maidens with no little attention, and had, one and all,\r\ninly bestowed on them no little praise, as being fair and shapely, and\r\ntherewithal sweet and debonair; but 'twas in the King's eyes that they\r\nespecially found favour. Indeed, as they came forth of the water, the\r\nKing had scanned each part of their bodies so intently that, had one then\r\npricked him, he would not have felt it, and his thoughts afterwards\r\ndwelling upon them, though he knew not who they were, nor how they came\r\nto be there, he felt stir within his heart a most ardent desire to\r\npleasure them, whereby he knew very well that, if he took not care, he\r\nwould grow enamoured; howbeit he knew not whether of the twain pleased\r\nhim the more, so like was each to the other. Having thus brooded a while,\r\nhe turned to Messer Neri, and asked who the two damsels were.\r\nWhereto:--\"Sire,\" replied Messer Neri, \"they are my twin daughters, and\r\nthey are called, the one, Ginevra the Fair, and the other, Isotta the\r\nBlonde.\" Whereupon the King was loud in praise of them, and exhorted\r\nMesser Neri to bestow them in marriage. To which Messer Neri demurred,\r\nfor that he no longer had the means. And nought of the supper now\r\nremaining to serve, save the fruit, in came the two young damsels in\r\ngowns of taffeta very fine, bearing in their hands two vast silver\r\nsalvers full of divers fruits, such as the season yielded, and set them\r\non the table before the King. Which done, they withdrew a little space\r\nand fell a singing to music a ditty, of which the opening words were as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Love, many words would not suffice\r\n  There where I am come to tell.\r\n\r\nAnd so dulcet and delightsome was the strain that to the King, his eyes\r\nand ears alike charmed, it seemed as if all the nine orders of angels\r\nwere descended there to sing. The song ended, they knelt and respectfully\r\ncraved the King's leave to depart; which, though sorely against his will,\r\nhe gave them with a forced gaiety.\r\n\r\nSupper ended, the King and his companions, having remounted their horses,\r\ntook leave of Messer Neri, and conversing of divers matters, returned to\r\nthe royal quarters; where the King, still harbouring his secret passion,\r\nnor, despite affairs of state that supervened, being able to forget the\r\nbeauty and sweetness of Ginevra the Fair, for whose sake he likewise\r\nloved her twin sister, was so limed by Love that he could scarce think of\r\naught else. So, feigning other reasons, he consorted familiarly with\r\nMesser Neri, and did much frequent his garden, that he might see Ginevra.\r\nAnd at length, being unable to endure his suffering any longer, and being\r\nminded, for that he could devise no other expedient, to despoil their\r\nfather not only of the one but of the other damsel also, he discovered\r\nboth his love and his project to Count Guy; who, being a good man and\r\ntrue, thus made answer:--\"Sire, your tale causes me not a little\r\nastonishment, and that more especially because of your conversation from\r\nyour childhood to this very day, I have, methinks, known more than any\r\nother man. And as no such passion did I ever mark in you, even in your\r\nyouth, when Love should more readily have fixed you with his fangs, as\r\nnow I discern, when you are already on the verge of old age, 'tis to me\r\nso strange, so surprising that you should veritably love, that I deem it\r\nlittle short of a miracle. And were it meet for me to reprove you, well\r\nwot I the language I should hold to you, considering that you are yet in\r\narms in a realm but lately won, among a people as yet unknown to you, and\r\nwily and treacherous in the extreme, and that the gravest anxieties and\r\nmatters of high policy engross your mind, so that you are not as yet able\r\nto sit you down, and nevertheless amid all these weighty concerns you\r\nhave given harbourage to false, flattering Love. This is not the wisdom\r\nof a great king, but the folly of a feather-pated boy. And moreover, what\r\nis far worse, you say that you are resolved to despoil this poor knight\r\nof his two daughters, whom, entertaining you in his house, and honouring\r\nyou to the best of his power, he brought into your presence all but\r\nnaked, testifying thereby, how great is his faith in you, and how assured\r\nhe is that you are a king, and not a devouring wolf. Have you so soon\r\nforgotten that 'twas Manfred's outrageous usage of his subjects that\r\nopened you the way into this realm? What treachery was he ever guilty of\r\nthat better merited eternal torment, than 'twould be in you to wrest from\r\none that honourably entreats you at once his hope and his consolation?\r\nWhat would be said of you if so you should do? Perchance you deem that\r\n'twould suffice to say:--'I did it because he is a Ghibelline.' Is it\r\nthen consistent with the justice of a king that those, be they who they\r\nmay, who seek his protection, as this man has sought yours, should be\r\nentreated after this sort? King, I bid you remember that exceeding great\r\nas is your glory to have vanquished Manfred, yet to conquer oneself is a\r\nstill greater glory: wherefore you, to whom belongs the correction of\r\nothers, see to it that you conquer yourself, and refrain this unruly\r\npassion; and let not such a blot mar the splendour of your achievements.\"\r\n\r\nSore stricken at heart by the Count's words, and the more mortified that\r\nhe acknowledged their truth, the King heaved a fervent sigh or two, and\r\nthen:--\"Count,\" quoth he, \"that enemy there is none, however mighty, but\r\nto the practised warrior is weak enough and easy to conquer in comparison\r\nof his own appetite, I make no doubt, but, great though the struggle will\r\nbe and immeasurable the force that it demands, so shrewdly galled am I by\r\nyour words, that not many days will have gone by before I shall without\r\nfail have done enough to shew you that I, that am the conqueror of\r\nothers, am no less able to gain the victory over myself.\" And indeed but\r\na few days thereafter, the King, on his return to Naples, being minded at\r\nonce to leave himself no excuse for dishonourable conduct, and to\r\nrecompense the knight for his honourable entreatment of him, did, albeit\r\n'twas hard for him to endow another with that which he had most ardently\r\ndesired for himself, none the less resolve to bestow the two damsels in\r\nmarriage, and that not as Messer Neri's daughters, but as his own.\r\nWherefore, Messer Neri consenting, he provided both with magnificent\r\ndowries, and gave Ginevra the Fair to Messer Maffeo da Palizzi, and\r\nIsotta the Blonde to Messer Guglielmo della Magna, noble knights and\r\ngreat barons both; which done, sad at heart beyond measure, he betook him\r\nto Apulia, and by incessant travail did so mortify his vehement appetite\r\nthat he snapped and broke in pieces the fetters of Love, and for the rest\r\nof his days was no more vexed by such passion.\r\n\r\nPerchance there will be those who say that 'tis but a trifle for a king\r\nto bestow two girls in marriage; nor shall I dispute it: but say we that\r\na king in love bestowed in marriage her whom he loved, neither having\r\ntaken nor taking, of his love, leaf or flower or fruit; then this I say\r\nwas a feat great indeed, nay, as great as might be.\r\n\r\nAfter such a sort then did this magnificent King, at once generously\r\nrewarding the noble knight, commendably honouring the damsels that he\r\nloved, and stoutly subduing himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nKing Pedro, being apprised of the fervent love borne him by Lisa, who\r\nthereof is sick, comforts her, and forthwith gives her in marriage to a\r\nyoung gentleman, and having kissed her on the brow, ever after professes\r\nhimself her knight.\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhen Fiammetta was come to the end of her story, and not a little praise\r\nhad been accorded to the virile magnificence of King Charles, albeit one\r\nthere was of the ladies, who, being a Ghibelline, joined not therein,\r\nPampinea, having received the king's command, thus began:--None is there\r\nof discernment, worshipful my ladies, that would say otherwise than you\r\nhave said touching good King Charles, unless for some other cause she\r\nbear him a grudge; however, for that there comes to my mind the,\r\nperchance no less honourable, entreatment of one of our Florentine girls\r\nby one of his adversaries, I am minded to recount the same to you.\r\n\r\nWhat time the French were driven forth of Sicily there dwelt at Palermo\r\none of our Florentines, that was an apothecary, Bernardo Puccini by name,\r\na man of great wealth, that by his lady had an only and exceeding fair\r\ndaughter, then of marriageable age. Now King Pedro of Arragon, being\r\ninstated in the sovereignty of the island, did at Palermo make with his\r\nbarons marvellous celebration thereof; during which, as he tilted after\r\nthe Catalan fashion, it befell that Bernardo's daughter, Lisa by name,\r\nbeing with other ladies at a window, did thence espy him in the course,\r\nwhereat being prodigiously delighted, she regarded him again and again,\r\nand grew fervently enamoured of him; nor yet, when the festivities were\r\nended, and she was at home with her father, was there aught she could\r\nthink of but this her exalted and aspiring love. In regard whereof that\r\nwhich most irked her was her sense of her low rank, which scarce\r\npermitted her any hope of a happy issue; but, for all that, give over her\r\nlove for the King she would not; nor yet, for fear of worse to come,\r\ndared she discover it. The King, meanwhile, recking, witting nothing of\r\nthe matter, her suffering waxed immeasurable, intolerable; and her love\r\never growing with ever fresh accessions of melancholy, the fair maiden,\r\noverborne at last, fell sick, and visibly day by day wasted like snow in\r\nsunlight. Distraught with grief thereat, her father and mother afforded\r\nher such succour as they might with words of good cheer, and counsel of\r\nphysicians, and physic; but all to no purpose; for that she in despair of\r\nher love was resolved no more to live.\r\n\r\nNow her father assuring her that there was no whim of hers but should be\r\ngratified, the fancy took her that, if she might find apt means, she\r\nwould, before she died, make her love and her resolve known to the King:\r\nwherefore one day she besought her father to cause Minuccio d'Arezzo, to\r\ncome to her; which Minuccio, was a singer and musician of those days,\r\nreputed most skilful, and well seen of King Pedro. Bernardo, deeming that\r\nLisa desired but to hear him play and sing a while, conveyed her message\r\nto him; and he, being an agreeable fellow, came to her forthwith, and\r\nafter giving her some words of loving cheer, sweetly discoursed some airs\r\nupon his viol, and then sang her some songs; whereby, while he thought to\r\ncomfort her, he did but add fire and flame to her love. Presently the\r\ngirl said that she would fain say a few words to him in private, and when\r\nall else were withdrawn from the chamber:--\"Minuccio,\" quoth she, \"thee\r\nhave I chosen, deeming thee most trusty, to be the keeper of my secret,\r\nrelying upon thee in the first place never to betray it to a soul, and\r\nnext to lend me in regard thereof such aid as thou mayst be able; and so\r\nI pray thee to do. Thou must know, then, Minuccio mine, that on the day\r\nwhen our lord King Pedro held the great festival in celebration of his\r\ntriumph, I, seeing him tilt, was so smitten with love of him that thereof\r\nwas kindled within my soul the fire which has brought me, as thou seest,\r\nto this pass; and knowing how ill it beseems me to love a king, and being\r\nunable, I say not to banish it from my heart, but so much as to bring it\r\nwithin bounds, and finding it exceeding grievous to bear, I have made\r\nchoice of death as the lesser pain; and die I shall. But should he wot\r\nnot of my love before I die, sore disconsolate should I depart; and\r\nknowing not by whom more aptly than by thee I might give him to know this\r\nmy frame, I am minded to entrust the communication thereof to thee; which\r\noffice I entreat thee not to refuse, and having discharged it, to let me\r\nknow, that dying thus consoled, I may depart this pain.\" Which said, she\r\nsilently wept.\r\n\r\nMarvelling at the loftiness of the girl's spirit and her desperate\r\ndetermination, Minuccio commiserated her not a little; and presently it\r\noccurred to him that there was a way in which he might honourably serve\r\nher: wherefore:--\"Lisa,\" quoth he, \"my faith I plight thee, wherein thou\r\nmayst place sure confidence that I shall never play thee false, and\r\nlauding thy high emprise, to wit, the setting thine affections upon so\r\ngreat a king, I proffer thee mine aid, whereby, so thou wilt be of good\r\ncheer, I hope, and believe, that, before thou shalt see the third day\r\nfrom now go by, I shall have brought thee tidings which will be to thee\r\nfor an exceeding great joy; and, not to lose time, I will set to work at\r\nonce.\" And so Lisa, assuring him that she would be of good cheer, and\r\nplying him afresh with instant obsecrations, bade him Godspeed; and\r\nMinuccio, having taken leave of her, hied him to one Mico da Siena, a\r\nvery expert rhymester of those days, who at his instant request made the\r\nensuing song:--\r\n\r\nHence hie thee, Love; and hasting to my King,\r\n  Give him to know what torment dire I bear,\r\n  How that to death I fare,\r\n  Still close, for fear, my passion harbouring.\r\n\r\nLo, Love, to thee with clasped hands I turn,\r\n  And pray thee seek him where he tarrieth,\r\n  And tell him how I oft for him do yearn,\r\n  So sweetly he my heart enamoureth;\r\n  And of the fire, wherewith I throughly burn,\r\n  I think to die, but may the hour uneath\r\n  Say, when my grievous pain shall with my breath\r\n  Surcease; till when, neither may fear nor shame\r\n  The least abate the flame.\r\n  Ah! to his ears my woeful story bring.\r\n\r\nSince of him I was first enamoured,\r\n  Never hast thou, O Love, my fearful heart\r\n  With any such fond hope encouraged,\r\n  As e'er its message to him to impart,\r\n  To him, my lord, that me so sore bested\r\n  Holds: dying thus, 'twere grievous to depart:\r\n  Perchance, were he to know my cruel smart,\r\n  'Twould not displease him; might I but make bold\r\n  My soul to him to unfold,\r\n  And shew him all my woeful languishing.\r\n\r\nLove, since 'twas not thy will me to accord\r\n  Such boldness as that e'er unto my King\r\n  I may discover my sad heart's full hoard,\r\n  Or any word or sign thereof him bring:\r\n  This all my prayer to thee, O sweet my Lord:\r\n  Hie thee to him, and so him whispering\r\n  Mind of the day I saw him tourneying\r\n  With all his paladins environed,\r\n  And grew enamoured\r\n  Ev'n to my very heart's disrupturing.\r\n\r\nWhich words Minuccio forthwith set to music after a soft and plaintive\r\nfashion befitting their sense; and on the third day thereafter hied him\r\nto court, while King Pedro was yet at breakfast. And being bidden by the\r\nKing to sing something to the accompaniment of his viol, he gave them\r\nthis song with such sweet concord of words and music that all the folk\r\nthat were in the King's hall seemed, as it were, entranced, so intent and\r\nabsorbed stood they to listen, and the King rather more than the rest.\r\nAnd when Minuccio had done singing, the King asked whence the song came,\r\nthat, as far as he knew, he had never heard it before. \"Sire,\" replied\r\nMinuccio, \"'tis not yet three days since 'twas made, words and music\r\nalike.\" And being asked by the King in regard of whom 'twas made:--\"I\r\ndare not,\" quoth he, \"discover such a secret save to you alone.\" Bent on\r\nhearing the story, the King, when the tables were cleared, took Minuccio\r\ninto his privy chamber; and there Minuccio told him everything exactly as\r\nhe had heard it from Lisa's lips. Whereby the King was much gratified,\r\nand lauded the maiden not a little, and said that a girl of such high\r\nspirit merited considerate treatment, and bade Minuccio be his envoy to\r\nher, and comfort her, and tell her that without fail that very day at\r\nvespers he would come to visit her. Overjoyed to bear the girl such\r\ngladsome tidings, Minuccio tarried not, but hied him back to the girl\r\nwith his viol, and being closeted with her, told her all that had passed,\r\nand then sang the song to the accompaniment of his viol. Whereby the girl\r\nwas so cheered and delighted that forthwith there appeared most marked\r\nand manifest signs of the amendment of her health, while with passionate\r\nlonging (albeit none in the house knew or divined it) she awaited the\r\nvesper hour, when she was to see her lord.\r\n\r\nKnowing the girl very well, and how fair she was, and pondering divers\r\ntimes on what Minuccio had told him, the King, being a prince of a\r\nliberal and kindly disposition, grew ever more compassionate. So, about\r\nvespers, he mounted his horse, and rode forth, as if for mere pleasure,\r\nand being come to the apothecary's house, demanded access to a very\r\ngoodly garden that the apothecary had, and having dismounted, after a\r\nwhile enquired of Bernardo touching his daughter, and whether he had yet\r\nbestowed her in marriage. \"Sire,\" replied Bernardo, \"she is not yet\r\nmarried; and indeed she has been and still is very ill howbeit since none\r\nshe is wonderfully amended.\" The significance of which amendment being\r\nforthwith apprehended by the King:--\"In good faith,\" quoth he, \"'twere a\r\npity so fair a creature were reft from the world so early; we would go in\r\nand visit her.\" And presently, attended only by two of his lords and\r\nBernardo, he betook him to her chamber, where being entered, he drew nigh\r\nthe bed, whereon the girl half reclined, half sate in eager expectation\r\nof his coming; and taking her by the hand:--\"Madonna,\" quoth he, \"what\r\nmeans this? A maiden like you should be the comfort of others, and you\r\nsuffer yourself to languish. We would entreat you that for love of us you\r\nbe of good cheer, so as speedily to recover your health.\" To feel the\r\ntouch of his hand whom she loved above all else, the girl, albeit\r\nsomewhat shamefast, was so enraptured that 'twas as if she was in\r\nParadise; and as soon as she was able:--\"My lord,\" she said, \"'twas the\r\nendeavour, weak as I am, to sustain a most grievous burden that brought\r\nthis sickness upon me; but 'twill not be long ere you will see me quit\r\nthereof, thanks to your courtesy.\" The hidden meaning of which words was\r\napprehended only by the King, who momently made more account of the girl,\r\nand again and again inly cursed Fortune, that had decreed that she should\r\nbe the daughter of such a man. And yet a while he tarried with her, and\r\ncomforted her, and so took his leave. Which gracious behaviour of the\r\nKing was not a little commended, and accounted a signal honour to the\r\napothecary and his daughter.\r\n\r\nThe girl, glad at heart as was ever lady of her lover, mended with\r\nreviving hope, and in a few days recovered her health, and therewith more\r\nthan all her wonted beauty. Whereupon the King, having taken counsel with\r\nthe Queen how to reward so great a love, got him one day to horse with a\r\ngreat company of his barons, and hied him to the apothecary's house; and\r\nbeing come into the garden, he sent for the apothecary and his daughter;\r\nand there, being joined by the Queen with not a few ladies, who received\r\nthe girl into their company, they made such cheer as 'twas a wonder to\r\nsee. And after a while the King and Queen having called Lisa to them,\r\nquoth the King:--\"Honourable damsel, by the great love that you have\r\nborne us we are moved greatly to honour you; and we trust that, for love\r\nof us, the honour that we design for you will be acceptable to you. Now\r\n'tis thus we would honour you: to wit, that, seeing that you are of\r\nmarriageable age, we would have you take for husband him that we shall\r\ngive you; albeit 'tis none the less our purpose ever to call ourself your\r\nknight, demanding no other tribute of all your love but one sole kiss.\"\r\nScarlet from brow to neck, the girl, making the King's pleasure her own,\r\nthus with a low voice replied:--\"My lord, very sure am I that, should it\r\ncome to be known that I was grown enamoured of you, most folk would hold\r\nme for a fool, deeming, perchance, that I was out of my mind, and witless\r\nalike of my own rank and yours; but God, who alone reads the hearts of us\r\nmortals, knows that even then, when first I did affect you, I wist that\r\nyou were the King, and I but the daughter of Bernardo the apothecary, and\r\nthat to suffer my passion to soar so high did ill become me; but, as you\r\nknow far better than I, none loves of set and discreet purpose, but only\r\naccording to the dictates of impulse and fancy; which law my forces,\r\nalbeit not seldom opposed, being powerless to withstand, I loved and\r\nstill love and shall ever love you. But as no sooner knew I myself\r\nsubjugated to your love, than I vowed to have ever no will but yours;\r\ntherefore not only am I compliant to take right gladly him whom you shall\r\nbe pleased to give me for husband, thereby conferring upon me great\r\nhonour and dignity; but if you should bid me tarry in the fire, delighted\r\nwere I to obey, so thereby I might pleasure you. How far it beseems me to\r\nhave you, my King, for my knight, you best know; and therefore I say\r\nnought thereof; nor will the kiss which you crave as your sole tribute of\r\nmy love be granted you save by leave of my Lady the Queen. Natheless, may\r\nyou have of this great graciousness that you and my Lady the Queen have\r\nshewn me, and which I may not requite, abundant recompense in the\r\nblessing and favour of God;\" and so she was silent.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was mightily delighted with the girl's answer, and deemed her\r\nas discreet as the King had said. The King then sent for the girl's\r\nfather and mother, and being assured that his intention had their\r\napproval, summoned to his presence a young man, Perdicone by name, that\r\nwas of gentle birth, but in poor circumstances, and put certain rings\r\ninto his hand, and (he nowise gainsaying) wedded him to Lisa. Which done,\r\nbesides jewels many and precious that he and the Queen gave the girl, he\r\nforthwith bestowed upon Perdicone two domains, right goodly and of ample\r\nrevenues, to wit, Ceffalu and Calatabellotta, saying:--\"We give them to\r\nthee for thy wife's dowry; what we have in store for thee thou wilt learn\r\nhereafter.\" Which said, he turned to the girl, and:--\"Now,\" quoth he, \"we\r\nare minded to cull that fruit which is due to us of thy love;\" and so,\r\ntaking her head between both his hands, he kissed her brow. Wherefore,\r\ngreat was the joy of Perdicone, and the father and mother of Lisa, and\r\nLisa herself, and mighty the cheer they made, and gaily did they\r\ncelebrate the nuptials. And, as many affirm, right well did the King keep\r\nhis promise to the girl; for that ever, while he lived, he called himself\r\nher knight, nor went to any passage of arms bearing other device than\r\nthat which he had from her.\r\n\r\nNow 'tis by doing after this sort that sovereigns win the hearts of their\r\nsubjects, give others occasion of well-doing, and gain for themselves an\r\nimperishable renown. At which mark few or none in our times have bent the\r\nbow of their understanding, the more part of the princes having become\r\nbut cruel tyrants.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL VIII.\r\n\r\n--\r\nSophronia, albeit she deems herself wife to Gisippus, is wife to Titus\r\nQuintius Fulvus, and goes with him to Rome, where Gisippus arrives in\r\nindigence, and deeming himself scorned by Titus, to compass his own\r\ndeath, avers that he has slain a man. Titus recognizes him, and to save\r\nhis life, alleges that 'twas he that slew the man: whereof he that did\r\nthe deed being witness, he discovers himself as the murderer. Whereby it\r\ncomes to pass that they are all three liberated by Octavianus; and Titus\r\ngives Gisippus his sister to wife, and shares with him all his substance.\r\n--\r\n\r\nSo ceased Pampinea; and when all the ladies, and most of all the\r\nGhibelline, had commended King Pedro, Filomena by command of the king\r\nthus began:--Magnificent my ladies, who wots not that there is nought so\r\ngreat but kings, when they have a mind, may accomplish it? As also that\r\n'tis of them that magnificence is most especially demanded? Now whoso,\r\nbeing powerful, does that which it appertains to him to do, does well;\r\nbut therein is no such matter of marvel, or occasion of extolling him to\r\nthe skies, as in his deed, of whom, for that his power is slight, less is\r\ndemanded. Wherefore, as you are so profuse of your words in exaltation of\r\nthe fine deeds, as you deem them, of monarchs, I make no manner of doubt,\r\nbut that the doings of our peers must seem to you yet more delectable and\r\ncommendable, when they equal or surpass those of kings. Accordingly 'tis\r\na transaction, laudable and magnificent, that passed between two\r\ncitizens, who were friends, that I purpose to recount to you in my story.\r\n\r\nI say, then, that what time Octavianus Caesar, not as yet hight Augustus,\r\nbut being in the office called Triumvirate, swayed the empire of Rome,\r\nthere dwelt at Rome a gentleman, Publius Quintius Fulvus by name, who,\r\nhaving a son, Titus Quintius Fulvus, that was a very prodigy of wit, sent\r\nhim to Athens to study philosophy, and to the best of his power commended\r\nhim to a nobleman of that city, Chremes by name, who was his very old\r\nfriend. Chremes lodged Titus in his own house with his son Gisippus, and\r\nplaced both Titus and Gisippus under a philosopher named Aristippus, to\r\nlearn of him his doctrine. And the two youths, thus keeping together,\r\nfound each the other's conversation so congruous with his own, that there\r\ngrew up between them a friendship so close and brotherly that 'twas never\r\nbroken by aught but death; nor knew either rest or solace save when he\r\nwas with the other. So, gifted alike with pre-eminent subtlety of wit,\r\nthey entered on their studies, and with even pace and prodigious applause\r\nscaled together the glorious heights of philosophy. In which way of life,\r\nto the exceeding great delight of Chremes, who entreated Titus as no less\r\nhis son than Gisippus, they continued for full three years. At the end\r\nwhereof, it befell (after the common course of things mundane) that\r\nChremes (being now aged) departed this life. Whom with equal grief they\r\nmourned as a common father; and the friends and kinsfolk of Chremes were\r\nalike at a loss to determine whether of the twain stood in need of the\r\nmore consolation upon the bereavement.\r\n\r\nSome months afterward the friends and kinsfolk of Gisippus came to him\r\nand exhorted him, as did also Titus, to take a wife, and found him a\r\nmaiden, wondrous fair, of one of the most noble houses of Athens, her\r\nname Sophronia, and her age about fifteen years. So a time was appointed\r\nfor their nuptials, and one day, when 'twas near at hand, Gisippus bade\r\nTitus come see the maiden, whom as yet he had not seen; and they being\r\ncome into her house, and she sitting betwixt them, Titus, as he were fain\r\nto observe with care the several charms of his friend's wife that was to\r\nbe, surveyed her with the closest attention, and being delighted beyond\r\nmeasure with all that he saw, grew, as inly he extolled her charms to the\r\nskies, enamoured of her with a love as ardent, albeit he gave no sign of\r\nit, as ever lover bore to lady. However, after they had tarried a while\r\nwith her, they took their leave, and went home, where Titus repaired to\r\nhis chamber, and there gave himself over to solitary musing on the\r\ndamsel's charms, and the longer he brooded, the more he burned for her.\r\nWhereon as he reflected, having heaved many a fervent sigh, thus he began\r\nto commune with himself:--Ah! woe worth thy life, Titus! Whom makest thou\r\nthe mistress of thy soul, thy love, thy hope? Knowest thou not that by\r\nreason as well of thy honourable entreatment by Chremes and his kin as of\r\nthe wholehearted friendship that is between thee and Gisippus, it behoves\r\nthee to have his betrothed in even such pious regard as if she were thy\r\nsister? Whither art thou suffering beguiling love, delusive hope, to\r\nhurry thee? Open the eyes of thine understanding, and see thyself,\r\nwretched man, as thou art; obey the dictates of thy reason, refrain thy\r\ncarnal appetite, control thine inordinate desires, and give thy thoughts\r\nanother bent; join battle with thy lust at the outset, and conquer\r\nthyself while there is yet time. This which thou wouldst have is not\r\nmeet, is not seemly: this which thou art minded to ensue, thou wouldst\r\nrather, though thou wert, as thou art not, sure of its attainment,\r\neschew, hadst thou but the respect thou shouldst have, for the claims of\r\ntrue friendship. So, then, Titus, what wilt thou do? What but abandon\r\nthis unseemly love, if thou wouldst do as it behoves thee?\r\n\r\nBut then, as he remembered Sophronia, his thoughts took the contrary\r\ndirection, and he recanted all he had said, musing on this wise:--The\r\nlaws of Love are of force above all others; they abrogate not only the\r\nlaw of human friendship, but the law Divine itself. How many times ere\r\nnow has father loved daughter, brother sister, step-mother step-son?\r\naberrations far more notable than that a friend should love his friend's\r\nwife, which has happened a thousand times. Besides which, I am young, and\r\nyouth is altogether subject to the laws of Love. Love's pleasure, then,\r\nshould be mine. The seemly is for folk of riper years. 'Tis not in my\r\npower to will aught save that which Love wills. So beauteous is this\r\ndamsel that there is none but should love her; and if I love her, who am\r\nyoung, who can justly censure me? I love her not because she is the\r\naffianced of Gisippus; no matter whose she was, I should love her all the\r\nsame. Herein is Fortune to blame, that gave her to my friend, Gisippus,\r\nrather than to another. And if she is worthy of love, as for beauty she\r\nis, Gisippus, if he should come to know that I love her, ought to be less\r\njealous than another.\r\n\r\nThen, scorning himself that he should indulge such thoughts, he relapsed\r\ninto the opposing mood, albeit not to abide there, but ever veering to\r\nand fro, he spent not only the whole of that day and the ensuing night,\r\nbut many others; insomuch that, being able neither to eat nor to sleep,\r\nhe grew so weak that he was fain to take to his bed. Gisippus, who had\r\nmarked his moodiness for some days, and now saw that he was fairly sick,\r\nwas much distressed; and with sedulous care, never quitting his side, he\r\ntended, and strove as best he might to comfort, him, not seldom and most\r\nearnestly demanding to know of him the cause of his melancholy and his\r\nsickness. Many were the subterfuges to which Titus resorted; but, as\r\nGisippus was not to be put off with his fables, finding himself hard\r\npressed by him, with sighs and sobs he made answer on this\r\nwise:--\"Gisippus, had such been the will of the Gods, I were fain rather\r\nto die than to live, seeing that Fortune has brought me to a strait in\r\nwhich needs must my virtue be put to the ordeal, and, to my most grievous\r\nshame, 'tis found wanting: whereof I confidently expect my due reward, to\r\nwit, death, which will be more welcome to me than to live, haunted ever\r\nby the memory of my baseness, which, as there is nought that from thee I\r\neither should or can conceal, I, not without burning shame, will discover\r\nto thee.\" And so he recounted the whole story from first to last, the\r\noccasion of his melancholy, its several moods, their conflict, and with\r\nwhich of them the victory rested, averring that he was dying of love for\r\nSophronia, and that, knowing how ill such love beseemed him, he had, for\r\npenance, elected to die, and deemed the end was now not far off.\r\nGisippus, hearing his words and seeing his tears, for a while knew not\r\nwhat to say, being himself smitten with the damsel's charms, albeit in a\r\nless degree than Titus; but ere long he made up his mind that Sophronia\r\nmust be less dear to him than his friend's life.\r\n\r\nAnd so, moved to tears by his friend's tears:--\"Titus,\" quoth he between\r\nhis sobs, \"but that thou art in need of comfort, I should reproach thee,\r\nthat thou hast offended against our friendship in that thou hast so long\r\nkept close from me this most distressful passion; and albeit thou didst\r\ndeem it unseemly, yet unseemly things should no more than things seemly\r\nbe withheld from a friend, for that, as a friend rejoices with his friend\r\nin things seemly, so he does his endeavour to wean his friend from things\r\nunseemly: but enough of this for the nonce: I pass to that which, I wot,\r\nis of greater moment. If thou ardently lovest Sophronia, my affianced, so\r\nfar from marvelling thereat, I should greatly marvel were it not so,\r\nknowing how fair she is, and how noble is thy soul, and thus the apter to\r\nbe swayed by passion, the more excelling is she by whom thou art charmed.\r\nAnd the juster the cause thou hast to love Sophronia, the greater is the\r\ninjustice with which thou complainest of Fortune (albeit thou dost it not\r\nin so many words) for giving her to me, as if thy love of her had been\r\nseemly, had she belonged to any other but me; whereas, if thou art still\r\nthe wise man thou wast wont to be, thou must know that to none could\r\nFortune have assigned her, with such good cause for thee to thank her, as\r\nto me. Had any other had her, albeit thy love had been seemly, he had\r\nloved her as his own, rather than as thine; which, if thou deem me even\r\nsuch a friend to thee as I am, thou wilt not apprehend from me, seeing\r\nthat I mind me not that, since we were friends, I had ever aught that was\r\nnot as much thine as mine. And so should I entreat thee herein as in all\r\nother matters, were the affair gone so far that nought else were\r\npossible; but as it is, I can make thee sole possessor of her; and so I\r\nmean to do; for I know not what cause thou shouldst have to prize my\r\nfriendship, if, where in seemly sort it might be done, I knew not how to\r\nsurrender my will to thine. 'Tis true that Sophronia is my betrothed, and\r\nthat I loved her much, and had great cheer in expectation of the\r\nnuptials: but as thou, being much more discerning than I, dost more\r\nfervently affect this rare prize, rest assured that she will enter my\r\nchamber not mine but thine. Wherefore, away with thy moodiness, banish\r\nthy melancholy, recover thy lost health, thy heartiness and jollity, and\r\ngladsomely, even from this very hour, anticipate the guerdon of thy love,\r\na love worthier far than mine.\"\r\n\r\nDelightful as was the prospect with which hope flattered Titus, as he\r\nheard Gisippus thus speak, no less was the shame with which right reason\r\naffected him, admonishing him that the greater was the liberality of\r\nGisippus, the less it would become him to profit thereby. Wherefore,\r\nstill weeping, he thus constrained himself to make answer:--\"Gisippus,\r\nthy generous and true friendship leaves me in no doubt as to the manner\r\nin which it becomes me to act. God forefend that her, whom, as to the\r\nmore worthy, He has given to thee, I should ever accept of thee for mine.\r\nHad He seen fit that she should be mine, far be it from thee or any other\r\nto suppose that He would ever have awarded her to thee. Renounce not,\r\nthen, that which thy choice and wise counsel and His gift have made\r\nthine, and leave me, to whom, as unworthy, He has appointed no such\r\nhappiness, to waste my life in tears; for either I shall conquer my\r\ngrief, which will be grateful to thee, or it will conquer me, and so I\r\nshall be quit of my pain.\" Quoth then Gisippus:--\"If our friendship,\r\nTitus, is of such a sort as may entitle me to enforce thee to ensue\r\nbehests of mine, or as may induce thee of thine own free will to ensue\r\nthe same, such is the use to which, most of all, I am minded to put it;\r\nand if thou lend not considerate ear unto my prayers, I shall by force,\r\nthat force which is lawful in the interest of a friend, make Sophronia\r\nthine. I know the might of Love, how redoubtable it is, and how, not once\r\nonly, but oftentimes, it has brought ill-starred lovers to a miserable\r\ndeath; and thee I see so hard bested that turn back thou mightst not, nor\r\nget the better of thy grief, but holding on thy course, must succumb, and\r\nperish, and without doubt I should speedily follow thee. And so, had I no\r\nother cause to love thee, thy life is precious to me in that my own is\r\nbound up with it. Sophronia, then, shall be thine; for thou wouldst not\r\nlightly find another so much to thy mind, and I shall readily find\r\nanother to love, and so shall content both thee and me. In which matter,\r\nperadventure, I might not be so liberal, were wives so scarce or hard to\r\nfind as are friends; wherefore, as 'tis so easy a matter for me to find\r\nanother wife, I had liefer--I say not lose her, for in giving her to thee\r\nlose her I shall not, but only transfer her to one that is my alter ego,\r\nand that to her advantage--I had liefer, I say, transfer her to thee than\r\nlose thee. And so, if aught my prayers avail with thee, I entreat thee\r\nextricate thyself from this thy woeful plight, and comfort at once\r\nthyself and me, and in good hope, address thyself to pluck that boon\r\nwhich thy fervent love craves of her for whom thou yearnest.\"\r\n\r\nStill scrupling, for shame, to consent that Sophronia should become his\r\nwife, Titus remained yet a while inexorable; but, yielding at last to the\r\nsolicitations of Love, reinforced by the exhortations of Gisippus, thus\r\nhe made answer:--\"Lo now, Gisippus, I know not how to call it, whether\r\n'tis more thy pleasure than mine, this which I do, seeing that 'tis as\r\nthy pleasure that thou so earnestly entreatest me to do it; but, as thy\r\nliberality is such that my shame, though becoming, may not withstand it,\r\nI will even do it. But of this rest assured, that I do so, witting well\r\nthat I receive from thee, not only the lady I love, but with her my very\r\nlife. And, Fate permitting, may the Gods grant me to make thee such\r\nhonourable and goodly requital as may shew thee how sensible I am of the\r\nboon, which thou, more compassionate of me than I am of myself,\r\nconferrest on me.\" Quoth then Gisippus:--\"Now, for the giving effect to\r\nour purpose, methinks, Titus, we should proceed on this wise. Thou\r\nknowest that Sophronia, by treaty at length concluded between my family\r\nand hers, is become my betrothed: were I now to say that she should not\r\nbe my wife, great indeed were the scandal that would come thereof, and I\r\nshould affront both her family and mine own; whereof, indeed, I should\r\nmake no account, so it gave me to see her become thine; but I fear that,\r\nwere I to give her up at this juncture, her family would forthwith bestow\r\nher upon another, perchance, than thee, and so we should both be losers.\r\nWherefore methinks that, so thou approve, I were best to complete what I\r\nhave begun, bring her home as my wife, and celebrate the nuptials, and\r\nthereafter we can arrange that thou lie with her, privily, as thy wife.\r\nThen, time and occasion serving, we will disclose the whole affair, and\r\nif they are satisfied, well and good; if not, 'twill be done all the\r\nsame, and as it cannot be undone, they must perforce make the best of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nWhich counsel being approved by Titus, Gisippus brought the lady home as\r\nhis wife, Titus being now recovered, and quite himself again; and when\r\nthey had made great cheer, and night was come, the ladies, having bedded\r\nthe bride, took their departure. Now the chambers of Titus and Gisippus\r\nwere contiguous, and one might pass from one into the other: Gisippus,\r\ntherefore, being come into his room, extinguished every ray of light, and\r\nstole into that of Titus, and bade him go get him to bed with his lady.\r\nWhereat Titus gave way to shame, and would have changed his mind, and\r\nrefused to go in; but Gisippus, no less zealous at heart than in words to\r\nserve his friend, after no small contention prevailed on him to go\r\nthither. Now no sooner was Titus abed with the lady, than, taking her in\r\nhis arms, he, as if jestingly, asked in a low tone whether she were\r\nminded to be his wife. She, taking him to be Gisippus, answered, yes;\r\nwhereupon he set a fair and costly ring on her finger, saying:--\"And I am\r\nminded to be thy husband.\" And having presently consummated the marriage,\r\nhe long and amorously disported him with her, neither she, nor any other,\r\nbeing ever aware that another than Gisippus lay with her.\r\n\r\nNow Titus and Sophronia being after this sort wedded, Publius, the father\r\nof Titus, departed this life. For which cause Titus was bidden by letter\r\nto return forthwith to Rome to see to his affairs; wherefore he took\r\ncounsel with Gisippus how he might take Sophronia thither with him; which\r\nmight not well be done without giving her to know how matters stood.\r\nWhereof, accordingly, one day, having called her into the chamber, they\r\nfully apprised her, Titus for her better assurance bringing to her\r\nrecollection not a little of what had passed between them. Whereat she,\r\nafter glancing from one to the other somewhat disdainfully, burst into a\r\nflood of tears, and reproached Gisippus that he had so deluded her; and\r\nforthwith, saying nought of the matter to any there, she hied her forth\r\nof Gisippus' house and home to her father, to whom and her mother she\r\nrecounted the deceit which Gisippus had practised upon them as upon her,\r\naverring that she was the wife not of Gisippus, as they supposed, but of\r\nTitus. Whereby her father was aggrieved exceedingly, and prolonged and\r\ngrave complaint was made thereof by him and his own and Gisippus'\r\nfamilies, and there was not a little parleying, and a world of pother.\r\nGisippus earned the hatred of both his own and Sophronia's kin, and all\r\nagreed that he merited not only censure but severe punishment. He,\r\nhowever, averred that he had done a thing seemly, and that Sophronia's\r\nkinsfolk owed him thanks for giving her in marriage to one better than\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAll which Titus witnessed with great suffering, and witting that 'twas\r\nthe way of the Greeks to launch forth in high words and menaces, and\r\nrefrain not until they should meet with one that answered them, whereupon\r\nthey were wont to grow not only humble but even abject, was at length\r\nminded that their clavers should no longer pass unanswered; and, as with\r\nhis Roman temper he united Athenian subtlety, he cleverly contrived to\r\nbring the kinsfolk, as well of Gisippus as of Sophronia, together in a\r\ntemple, where, being entered, attended only by Gisippus, thus (they being\r\nintent to hear) he harangued them:--\"'Tis the opinion of not a few\r\nphilosophers that whatsoever mortals do is ordained by the providence of\r\nthe immortal Gods; for which cause some would have it that nought either\r\nis, or ever shall be, done, save of necessity, albeit others there are\r\nthat restrict this necessity to that which is already done. Regard we but\r\nthese opinions with some little attention, and we shall very plainly\r\nperceive that to censure that which cannot be undone is nought else but\r\nto be minded to shew oneself wiser than the Gods; by whom we must suppose\r\nthat we and our affairs are swayed and governed with uniform and unerring\r\nwisdom. Whereby you may very readily understand how vain and foolish a\r\npresumption it is to pass judgment on their doings, and what manner and\r\nmight of chains they need who suffer themselves to be transported to such\r\nexcess of daring. Among whom, in my judgment, you must one and all be\r\nnumbered, if 'tis true, what I hear, to wit, that you have complained and\r\ndo continue to complain that Sophronia, albeit you gave her to Gisippus,\r\nis, nevertheless, become my wife; not considering that 'twas ordained\r\nfrom all eternity that she should become, not the wife of Gisippus, but\r\nmine, as the fact does now declare.\r\n\r\n\"But, for that discourse of the secret providence and purposes of the\r\nGods seems to many a matter hard and scarce to be understood, I am\r\nwilling to assume that they meddle in no wise with our concerns, and to\r\ndescend to the region of human counsels; in speaking whereof I must needs\r\ndo two things quite at variance with my wont, to wit, in some degree\r\npraise myself and censure or vilify another. But, as in either case I\r\nmean not to deviate from the truth, and 'tis what the occasion demands, I\r\nshall not fail so to do. With bitter upbraidings, animated rather by rage\r\nthan by reason, you cease not to murmur, nay, to cry out, against\r\nGisippus, and to harass him with your abuse, and hold him condemned, for\r\nthat her, whom you saw fit to give him, he has seen fit to give me, to\r\nwife; wherein I deem him worthy of the highest commendation, and that for\r\ntwo reasons, first, because he has done the office of a friend, and\r\nsecondly, because he has done more wisely than you did. After what sort\r\nthe sacred laws of friendship prescribe that friend shall entreat friend,\r\n'tis not to my present purpose to declare; 'twill suffice to remind you\r\nthat the tie of friendship should be more binding than that of blood, or\r\nkinship; seeing that our friends are of our own choosing, whereas our\r\nkinsfolk are appointed us by Fortune; wherefore, if my life was more to\r\nGisippus than your goodwill, since I am, as I hold myself, his friend,\r\ncan any wonder thereat?\r\n\r\n\"But pass we to my second reason; in the exposition whereof I must needs\r\nwith yet more cogency prove to you that he has been wiser than you,\r\nseeing that, methinks, you wot nought of the providence of the Gods, and\r\nstill less of the consequences of friendship. I say then, that, as 'twas\r\nyour premeditated and deliberate choice that gave Sophronia to this young\r\nphilosopher Gisippus, so 'twas his that gave her to another young\r\nphilosopher. 'Twas your counsel that gave her to an Athenian; 'twas his\r\nthat gave her to a Roman: 'twas your counsel that gave her to a man of\r\ngentle birth; 'twas his that gave her to one of birth yet gentler:\r\nwealthy was he to whom your counsel gave her, most wealthy he to whom his\r\ncounsel gave her. Not only did he to whom your counsel gave her, love her\r\nnot, but he scarce knew her, whereas 'twas to one that loved her beyond\r\nall other blessings, nay, more dearly than his own life, that his counsel\r\ngave her. And to the end that it may appear more plainly that 'tis even\r\nas I say, and Gisippus' counsel more to be commended than yours, let us\r\nexamine it point by point. That I, like Gisippus, am young and a\r\nphilosopher, my countenance and my pursuits may, without making more\r\nwords about the matter, sufficiently attest. We are also of the same age,\r\nand have ever kept pace together in our studies. Now true it is that he\r\nis an Athenian, and I am a Roman. But, as touching the comparative glory\r\nof the cities, should the matter be mooted, I say that I am of a free\r\ncity, and he of a city tributary; that I am of a city that is mistress of\r\nall the world, and he of one that is subject to mine; that I am of a city\r\nthat flourishes mightily in arms, in empire, and in arts; whereas he\r\ncannot boast his city as famous save in arts.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, albeit you see me here in the guise of a most humble scholar,\r\nI am not born of the dregs of the populace of Rome. My halls and the\r\npublic places of Rome are full of the antique effigies of my forefathers,\r\nand the annals of Rome abound with the records of triumphs led by the\r\nQuintii to the Roman Capitol; and so far from age having withered it,\r\nto-day, yet more abundantly than ever of yore, flourishes the glory of\r\nour name. Of my wealth I forbear, for shame, to speak, being mindful that\r\nhonest poverty is the time-honoured and richest inheritance of the noble\r\ncitizens of Rome; but, allowing for the nonce the opinion of the vulgar,\r\nwhich holds poverty in disrepute, and highly appraises wealth, I, albeit\r\nI never sought it, yet, as the favoured of Fortune, have abundant store\r\nthereof. Now well I wot that, Gisippus being of your own city, you justly\r\nprized and prize an alliance with him; but not a whit less should you\r\nprize an alliance with me at Rome, considering that there you will have\r\nin me an excellent host, and a patron apt, zealous and potent to serve\r\nyou as well in matters of public interest as in your private concerns.\r\nWho, then, dismissing all bias from his mind, and judging with impartial\r\nreason, would deem your counsel more commendable than that of Gisippus?\r\nAssuredly none. Sophronia, then, being married to Titus Quintius Fulvus,\r\na citizen of Rome, of an ancient and illustrious house, and wealthy, and\r\na friend of Gisippus, whoso takes umbrage or offence thereat, does that\r\nwhich it behoves him not to do, and knows not what he does.\r\n\r\n\"Perchance some will say that their complaint is not that Sophronia is\r\nthe wife of Titus, but that she became his wife after such a sort, to\r\nwit, privily, by theft, neither friend nor any of her kin witting aught\r\nthereof; but herein is no matter of marvel, no prodigy as yet unheard-of.\r\nI need not instance those who before now have taken to them husbands in\r\ndefiance of their fathers' will, or have eloped with their lovers and\r\nbeen their mistresses before they were their wives, or of whose marriages\r\nno word has been spoken, until their pregnancy or parturition published\r\nthem to the world, and necessity sanctioned the fact: nought of this has\r\nhappened in the case of Sophronia; on the contrary, 'twas in proper form,\r\nand in meet and seemly sort, that Gisippus gave her to Titus. And others,\r\nperadventure, will say that 'twas by one to whom such office belonged not\r\nthat she was bestowed in marriage. Nay, but this is but vain and womanish\r\nquerulousness, and comes of scant consideration. Know we not, then, that\r\nFortune varies according to circumstances her methods and her means of\r\ndisposing events to their predetermined ends? What matters it to me, if\r\nit be a cobbler, rather than a philosopher, that Fortune has ordained to\r\ncompass something for me, whether privily or overtly, so only the result\r\nis as it should be? I ought, indeed, to take order, if the cobbler be\r\nindiscreet, that he meddle no more in affairs of mine, but, at the same\r\ntime, I ought to thank him for what he has done. If Gisippus has duly\r\nbestowed Sophronia in marriage, it is gratuitous folly to find fault with\r\nthe manner and the person. If you mistrust his judgment, have a care that\r\nit be not in his power to do the like again, but thank him for this turn.\r\n\r\n\"Natheless, you are to know that I used no cunning practice or deceit to\r\nsully in any degree the fair fame of your house in the person of\r\nSophronia; and, albeit I took her privily to wife, I came not as a\r\nravisher to despoil her of her virginity, nor in any hostile sort was I\r\nminded to make her mine on dishonourable terms, and spurn your alliance;\r\nbut, being fervently enamoured of her bewitching beauty and her noble\r\nqualities, I wist well that, should I make suit for her with those\r\nformalities which you, perchance, will say were due, then, for the great\r\nlove you bear her, and for fear lest I should take her away with me to\r\nRome, I might not hope to have her. Accordingly I made use of the secret\r\npractice which is now manifest to you, and brought Gisippus to consent in\r\nmy interest to that whereto he was averse; and thereafter, ardently\r\nthough I loved her, I sought not to commingle with her as a lover, but as\r\na husband, nor closed with her, until, as she herself by her true witness\r\nmay assure you, I had with apt words and with the ring made her my lawful\r\nwife, asking her if she would have me to husband, whereto she answered,\r\nyes. Wherein if she seem to have been tricked, 'tis not I that am to\r\nblame, but she, for that she asked me not who I was.\r\n\r\n\"This, then, is the great wrong, sin, crime, whereof for love and\r\nfriendship's sake Gisippus and I are guilty, that Sophronia is privily\r\nbecome the wife of Titus Quintius: 'tis for this that you harass him with\r\nyour menaces and hostile machinations. What more would you do, had he\r\ngiven her to a villein, to a caitiff, to a slave? Where would you find\r\nfetters, dungeons, crosses adequate to your vengeance? But enough of this\r\nat present: an event, which I did not expect, has now happened; my father\r\nis dead; and I must needs return to Rome; wherefore, being fain to take\r\nSophronia with me, I have discovered to you that which otherwise I had,\r\nperchance, still kept close. Whereto, if you are wise, you will gladly\r\nreconcile yourselves; for that, if I had been minded to play you false,\r\nor put an affront upon you, I might have scornfully abandoned her to you;\r\nbut God forefend that such baseness be ever harboured in a Roman breast.\r\nSophronia, then, by the will of the Gods, by force of law, and by my own\r\nlove-taught astuteness, is mine. The which it would seem that you,\r\ndeeming yourselves, peradventure, wiser than the Gods, or the rest of\r\nmankind, do foolishly set at nought, and that in two ways alike most\r\noffensive to me; inasmuch as you both withhold from me Sophronia, in whom\r\nright, as against me, you have none, and also entreat as your enemy\r\nGisippus, to whom you are rightfully bounden. The folly whereof I purpose\r\nnot at present fully to expound to you, but in friendly sort to counsel\r\nyou to abate your wrath and abandon all your schemes of vengeance, and\r\nrestore Sophronia to me, that I may part from you on terms of amity and\r\nalliance, and so abide: but of this rest assured, that whether this,\r\nwhich is done, like you or not, if you are minded to contravene it, I\r\nshall take Gisippus hence with me, and once arrived in Rome, shall in\r\nyour despite find means to recover her who is lawfully mine, and pursuing\r\nyou with unremitting enmity, will apprise you by experience of the full\r\nmeasure and effect of a Roman's wrath.\"\r\n\r\nHaving so said, Titus started to his feet, his countenance distorted by\r\nanger, and took Gisippus by the hand, and with manifest contempt for all\r\nthe rest, shaking his head at them and threatening them, led him out of\r\nthe temple. They that remained in the temple, being partly persuaded by\r\nhis arguments to accept his alliance and friendship, partly terrified by\r\nhis last words, resolved by common consent that 'twas better to have the\r\nalliance of Titus, as they had lost that of Gisippus, than to add to that\r\nloss the enmity of Titus. Wherefore they followed Titus, and having come\r\nup with him, told him that they were well pleased that Sophronia should\r\nbe his, and that they should prize his alliance and the friendship of\r\ndear Gisippus; and having ratified this treaty of amity and alliance with\r\nmutual cheer, they departed and sent Sophronia to Titus. Sophronia,\r\ndiscreetly making a virtue of necessity, transferred forthwith to Titus\r\nthe love she had borne Gisippus, and being come with Titus to Rome, was\r\nthere received with no small honour. Gisippus tarried in Athens, held in\r\nlittle account by well-nigh all the citizens, and being involved in\r\ncertain of their broils, was, not long afterwards, with all his\r\nhousehold, banished the city, poor, nay, destitute, and condemned to\r\nperpetual exile. Thus hard bested, and at length reduced to mendicancy,\r\nhe made his way, so as least discomfortably he might, to Rome, being\r\nminded to see whether Titus would remember him: and there, learning that\r\nTitus lived, and was much affected by all the Romans, and having found\r\nout his house, he took his stand in front of it, and watched until Titus\r\ncame by; to whom, for shame of the sorry trim that he was in, he ventured\r\nno word, but did his endeavour that he might be seen of him, hoping that\r\nTitus might recognize him, and call him by his name: but Titus passing\r\non, Gisippus deeming that he had seen and avoided him, and calling to\r\nmind that which aforetime he had done for him, went away wroth and\r\ndesperate. And fasting and penniless, and--for 'twas now night--knowing\r\nnot whither he went, and yearning above all for death, he wandered by\r\nchance to a spot, which, albeit 'twas within the city, had much of the\r\naspect of a wilderness, and espying a spacious grotto, he took shelter\r\nthere for the night; and worn out at last with grief, on the bare ground,\r\nwretchedly clad as he was, he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nNow two men that had that night gone out a thieving, having committed the\r\ntheft, came towards morning to the grotto, and there quarrelled, and the\r\nstronger slew the other, and took himself off. Aroused by the noise,\r\nGisippus witnessed the murder, and deeming that he had now the means of\r\ncompassing, without suicide, the death for which he so much longed,\r\nbudged not a jot, but stayed there, until the serjeants of the court,\r\nwhich had already got wind of the affair, came on the scene, and laid\r\nviolent hands upon him, and led him away. Being examined, he confessed\r\nthat he had slain the man, and had then been unable to make his escape\r\nfrom the grotto. Wherefore the praetor, Marcus Varro by name, sentenced\r\nhim to death by crucifixion, as was then the custom. But Titus, who\r\nhappened at that moment to come into the praetorium, being told the crime\r\nfor which he was condemned, and scanning the poor wretch's face,\r\npresently recognized him for Gisippus, and marvelled how he should come\r\nto be there, and in such a woeful plight. And most ardently desiring to\r\nsuccour him, nor seeing other way to save his life except to exonerate\r\nhim by accusing himself, he straightway stepped forward, and said with a\r\nloud voice:--\"Marcus Varro, call back the poor man on whom thou hast\r\npassed sentence, for he is innocent. 'Tis enough that I have incurred the\r\nwrath of the Gods by one deed of violence, to wit, the murder of him whom\r\nyour serjeants found dead this morning, without aggravating my offence by\r\nthe death of another innocent man.\" Perplexed, and vexed that he should\r\nhave been heard by all in the praetorium, but unable honourably to avoid\r\ncompliance with that which the laws enjoined, Varro had Gisippus brought\r\nback, and in presence of Titus said to him:--\"How camest thou to be so\r\nmad as, though no constraint was put upon thee, to confess a deed thou\r\nnever didst, thy life being at stake? Thou saidst that 'twas thou by whom\r\nthe man was slain last night, and now comes this other, and says that\r\n'twas not thou but he that slew him.\" Gisippus looked, and seeing Titus,\r\nwist well that, being grateful for the service rendered by him in the\r\npast, Titus was now minded to save his life at the cost of his own:\r\nwherefore, affected to tears, he said:--\"Nay but, Varro, in very sooth I\r\nslew him, and 'tis now too late, this tender solicitude of Titus for my\r\ndeliverance.\" But on his part:--\"Praetor,\" quoth Titus, \"thou seest this\r\nman is a stranger, and was found unarmed beside the murdered man; thou\r\ncanst not doubt that he was fain of death for very wretchedness:\r\nwherefore discharge him, and let punishment light on me who have merited\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nMarvelling at the importunity of both, Varro readily surmised that\r\nneither was guilty. And while he was casting about how he might acquit\r\nthem, lo, in came a young man, one Publius Ambustus, a desperate\r\ncharacter, and known to all the Romans for an arrant thief. He it was\r\nthat had verily committed the murder, and witting both the men to be\r\ninnocent of that of which each accused himself, so sore at heart was he\r\nby reason of their innocence, that, overborne by an exceeding great\r\ncompassion, he presented himself before Varro, and:--\"Praetor,\" quoth he,\r\n\"'tis destiny draws me hither to loose the knot of these men's\r\ncontention; and some God within me leaves me no peace of his whips and\r\nstings, until I discover my offence: wherefore know that neither of these\r\nmen is guilty of that of which each accuses himself. 'Tis verily I that\r\nslew the man this morning about daybreak; and before I slew him, while I\r\nwas sharing our plunder with him, I espied this poor fellow asleep there.\r\nNought need I say to clear Titus: the general bruit of his illustrious\r\nrenown attests that he is not a man of such a sort. Discharge him,\r\ntherefore, and exact from me the penalty prescribed by the laws.\"\r\n\r\nThe affair had by this time come to the ears of Octavianus, who caused\r\nall three to be brought before him, and demanded to know the causes by\r\nwhich they had been severally moved to accuse themselves; and, each\r\nhaving told his story, Octavianus released the two by reason of their\r\ninnocence, and the third for love of them. Titus took Gisippus home,\r\nhaving first chidden him not a little for his faint-heartedness and\r\ndiffidence, and there, Sophronia receiving him as a brother, did him\r\nmarvellous cheer; and having comforted him a while, and arrayed him in\r\napparel befitting his worth and birth, he first shared with him all his\r\nsubstance, and then gave him his sister, a young damsel named Fulvia, to\r\nwife, and said to him:--\"Choose now, Gisippus, whether thou wilt tarry\r\nhere with me, or go back to Achaia with all that I have given thee.\"\r\n\r\nPartly perforce of his banishment from his city, partly for that the\r\nsweet friendship of Titus was justly dear to him, Gisippus consented to\r\nbecome a Roman. And so, long and happily they lived together at Rome,\r\nGisippus with his Fulvia, and Titus with his Sophronia, in the same\r\nhouse, growing, if possible, greater friends day by day.\r\n\r\nExceeding sacred then, is friendship, and worthy not only to be had in\r\nveneration, but to be extolled with never-ending praise, as the most\r\ndutiful mother of magnificence and seemliness, sister of gratitude and\r\ncharity, and foe to enmity and avarice; ever, without waiting to be\r\nasked, ready to do as generously by another as she would be done by\r\nherself. Rarely indeed is it to-day that twain are found, in whom her\r\nmost holy fruits are manifest; for which is most shamefully answerable\r\nthe covetousness of mankind, which, regarding only private interest, has\r\nbanished friendship beyond earth's farthest bourne, there to abide in\r\nperpetual exile. How should love, or wealth, or kinship, how should aught\r\nbut friendship have so quickened the soul of Gisippus that the tears and\r\nsighs of Titus should incline his heart to cede to him the fair and\r\ngracious lady that was his betrothed and his beloved? Laws, menaces,\r\nterror! How should these, how should aught but friendship, have withheld\r\nGisippus, in lonely places, in hidden retreats, in his own bed, from\r\nenfolding (not perchance unsolicited by her) the fair damsel within his\r\nyouthful embrace? Honours, rewards, gains! Would Gisippus for these,\r\nwould he for aught but friendship, have made nothing of the loss of\r\nkindred--his own and Sophronia's--have made nothing of the injurious\r\nmurmurs of the populace, have made nothing of mocks and scorns, so only\r\nhe might content his friend? And on the other hand, for what other cause\r\nthan friendship had Titus, when he might decently have feigned not to\r\nsee, have striven with the utmost zeal to compass his own death, and set\r\nhimself upon the cross in Gisippus' stead? And what but friendship had\r\nleft no place for suspicion in the soul of Titus, and filled it with a\r\nmost fervent desire to give his sister to Gisippus, albeit he saw him to\r\nbe reduced to extreme penury and destitution? But so it is that men covet\r\nhosts of acquaintance, troops of kinsfolk, offspring in plenty; and the\r\nnumber of their dependants increases with their wealth; and they reflect\r\nnot that there is none of these, be he who he may, but will be more\r\napprehensive of the least peril threatening himself than cumbered to\r\navert a great peril from his lord or kinsman, whereas between friends we\r\nknow 'tis quite contrariwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL IX.\r\n\r\n--\r\nSaladin, in guise of a merchant, is honourably entreated by Messer\r\nTorello. The Crusade ensuing, Messer Torello appoints a date, after which\r\nhis wife may marry again: he is taken prisoner, and by training hawks\r\ncomes under the Soldan's notice. The Soldan recognizes him, makes himself\r\nknown to him, and entreats him with all honour. Messer Torello falls\r\nsick, and by magic arts is transported in a single night to Pavia, where\r\nhis wife's second marriage is then to be solemnized, and being present\r\nthereat, is recognized by her, and returns with her to his house.\r\n--\r\n\r\nSo ended Filomena her story, and when all alike had commended the\r\nmagnificence shewn by Titus in his gratitude, the king, reserving the\r\nlast place for Dioneo, thus began:--Lovesome my ladies, true beyond all\r\nquestion is what Filomena reports of friendship, and with justice did she\r\ndeplore in her closing words the little account in which 'tis held to-day\r\namong mortals. And were we here for the purpose of correcting, or even of\r\ncensuring, the vices of the age, I should add a copious sequel to her\r\ndiscourse; but as we have another end in view, it has occurred to me to\r\nset before you in a narrative, which will be of considerable length, but\r\nentertaining throughout, an instance of Saladin's magnificence, to the\r\nend that, albeit, by reason of our vices, it may not be possible for us\r\nto gain to the full the friendship of any, yet by the matters whereof you\r\nshall hear in my story we may at least be incited to take delight in\r\ndoing good offices, in the hope that sooner or later we may come by our\r\nreward thereof.\r\n\r\nI say, then, that in the time of the Emperor Frederic I., as certain\r\nwriters affirm, the Christians made common emprise for the recovery of\r\nthe Holy Land. Whereof that most valiant prince, Saladin, then Soldan of\r\nBabylonia, being in good time apprised, resolved to see for himself the\r\npreparations made by the Christian potentates for the said emprise, that\r\nhe might put himself in better trim to meet them. So, having ordered all\r\nthings to his mind in Egypt, he made as if he were bound on a pilgrimage,\r\nand attended only by two of his chiefest and sagest lords, and three\r\nservants, took the road in the guise of a merchant. And having surveyed\r\nmany provinces of Christendom, as they rode through Lombardy with intent\r\nto cross the Alps, they chanced, between Milan and Pavia, to fall in with\r\na gentleman, one Messer Torello d'Istria da Pavia, who with his servants\r\nand his dogs and falcons was betaking him to a fine estate that he had on\r\nthe Ticino, there to tarry a while. Now Messer Torello no sooner espied\r\nSaladin and his lords than he guessed them to be gentlemen and\r\nforeigners; and, being zealous to do them honour, when Saladin asked one\r\nof his servants how far off Pavia might still be, and if he might win\r\nthere in time to enter the town, he suffered not the servant to make\r\nanswer, but:--\"No, gentlemen,\" quoth he, \"by the time you reach Pavia\r\n'twill be too late for you to enter.\" \"So!\" replied Saladin, \"then might\r\nyou be pleased to direct us, as we are strangers, where we may best be\r\nlodged?\" \"That gladly will I,\" returned Messer Torello. \"I was but now\r\nthinking to send one of these my men on an errand to Pavia; I will send\r\nhim with you, and he will guide you to a place where you will find very\r\ncomfortable quarters.\" Then, turning to one of his most trusty servants,\r\nhe gave him his instructions, and despatched him with them: after which,\r\nhe repaired to his estate, and forthwith, as best he might, caused a\r\ngoodly supper to be made ready, and the tables set in his garden; which\r\ndone, he stationed himself at the gate on the look-out for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe servant, conversing with the gentlemen of divers matters, brought\r\nthem by devious roads to his lord's estate without their being ware of\r\nit. Whom as soon as Messer Torello espied, he came forth afoot to meet\r\nthem, and said with a smile:--\"A hearty welcome to you, gentlemen.\" Now\r\nSaladin, being very quick of apprehension, perceived that the knight had\r\ndoubted, when he met them, that, were he to bid them to his house, they\r\nmight not accept his hospitality; and accordingly, that it might not be\r\nin their power to decline it, had brought them to his house by a ruse.\r\nAnd so, returning his greeting:--\"Sir,\" quoth he, \"were it meet to find\r\nfault with those that shew courtesy, we should have a grievance against\r\nyou, for that, to say nought of somewhat delaying our journey, you have\r\nin guerdon of a single greeting constrained us to accept so noble a\r\ncourtesy as yours.\" Whereto the knight, who was of good understanding and\r\nwell-spoken, made answer:--\"Gentlemen, such courtesy as we shew you will,\r\nin comparison of that which, by what I gather from your aspect, were meet\r\nfor you, prove but a sorry thing; but in sooth this side of Pavia you\r\nmight not anywhere have been well lodged; wherefore take it not amiss\r\nthat you have come somewhat out of your way to find less discomfortable\r\nquarters.\" And as he spoke, about them flocked the servants, who, having\r\nhelped them to dismount, saw to their horses; whereupon Messer Torello\r\nconducted them to the chambers that were made ready for them, where,\r\nhaving caused them to be relieved of their boots, and refreshed with the\r\ncoolest of wines, he held pleasant converse with them until supper-time.\r\nSaladin and his lords and servants all knew Latin, so that they both\r\nunderstood and made themselves understood very well, and there was none\r\nof them but adjudged this knight to be the most agreeable and debonair\r\nman, and therewithal the best talker, that he had ever seen; while to\r\nMesser Torello, on the other hand, they shewed as far greater magnificoes\r\nthan he had at first supposed, whereby he was inly vexed that he had not\r\nbeen able that evening to do them the honours of company, and a more\r\nceremonious banquet. For which default he resolved to make amends on the\r\nensuing morning: wherefore, having imparted to one of his servants that\r\nwhich he would have done, he sent him to his most judicious and\r\nhighminded lady at Pavia, which was close by, and where never a gate was\r\nlocked. Which done, he brought the gentlemen into the garden, and\r\ncourteously asked them who they were. \"We are Cypriote merchants,\"\r\nreplied Saladin, \"and 'tis from Cyprus we come, and we are on our way to\r\nParis on business.\" Quoth then Messer Torello:--\"Would to God that our\r\ncountry bred gentlemen of such a quality as are the merchants that I see\r\nCyprus breeds!\" From which they passed to discourse of other matters,\r\nuntil, supper-time being come, he besought them to seat them at table;\r\nwhereat, considering that the supper was but improvised, their\r\nentertainment was excellent and well-ordered.\r\n\r\nThe tables being cleared, Messer Torello, surmising that they must be\r\nweary, kept them no long time from their rest, but bestowed them in most\r\ncomfortable beds, and soon after went to rest himself. Meanwhile the\r\nservant that he had sent to Pavia did his lord's errand to the lady, who,\r\nin the style rather of a queen than of a housewife, forthwith assembled\r\nnot a few of Messer Torello's friends and vassals, and caused all meet\r\npreparation to be made for a magnificent banquet, and by messengers\r\nbearing torches bade not a few of the noblest of the citizens thereto;\r\nand had store of silken and other fabrics and vair brought in, and all\r\nset in order in every point as her husband had directed. Day came, and\r\nthe gentlemen being risen, Messer Torello got him to horse with them, and\r\nhaving sent for his hawks, brought them to a ford, and shewed them how\r\nthe hawks flew. By and by, Saladin requesting of him a guide to the best\r\ninn at Pavia:--\"I myself will be your guide,\" returned Messer Torello,\r\n\"for I have occasion to go thither.\" Which offer they, nothing doubting,\r\ndid gladly accept, and so with him they set forth; and about tierce,\r\nbeing come to the city, and expecting to be directed to the best inn,\r\nthey were brought by Messer Torello, to his own house, where they were\r\nforthwith surrounded by full fifty of the greatest folk of the city,\r\ngathered there to give the gentlemen a welcome; and 'twas who should hold\r\na bridle or a stirrup, while they dismounted. Whereby Saladin and his\r\nlords more than guessing the truth:--\"Messer Torello,\" quoth they, \"'twas\r\nnot this that we craved of you. Honour enough had we from you last night,\r\nand far in excess of our desires; wherefore thou mightst very well have\r\nleft us to go our own road.\" Whereto:--\"Gentlemen,\" replied Messer\r\nTorello, \"for that which was done yestereve I have to thank Fortune\r\nrather than you: seeing that Fortune surprised you on the road at an hour\r\nwhen you must needs repair to my little house: for that which shall be\r\ndone this morning I shall be beholden to you, as will also these\r\ngentlemen that surround you, with whom, if you deem it courteous so to\r\ndo, you may refuse to breakfast, if you like.\"\r\n\r\nFairly conquered, Saladin and his lords dismounted, and heartily welcomed\r\nby the gentlemen, were conducted to the chambers which had been most\r\nsumptuously adorned for their use; and having laid aside their riding\r\ndress, and taken some refreshment, repaired to the saloon, where all had\r\nbeen made ready with splendour. There, having washed their hands, they\r\nsat them down to table, and were regaled with a magnificent repast of\r\nmany courses, served with all stately and fair ceremony, insomuch that,\r\nhad the Emperor himself been there, 'twould not have been possible to do\r\nhim more honour. And albeit Saladin and his lords were grandees and used\r\nto exceeding great displays of pomp and state, nevertheless this shewed\r\nto them as not a little marvellous, and one of the greatest they had ever\r\nseen, having regard to the quality of their host, whom they knew to be\r\nbut a citizen, and no lord. Breakfast done, and the tables cleared, they\r\nconversed a while of high matters, and then, as 'twas very hot, all the\r\ngentlemen of Pavia--so it pleased Messer Torello--retired for their\r\nsiesta, while he remained with his three guests; with whom he presently\r\nwithdrew into a chamber, whither, that there might be nought that he held\r\ndear which they had not seen, he called his noble lady. And so the dame,\r\nexceeding fair and stately of person, and arrayed in rich apparel, with\r\nher two little boys, that shewed as two angels, on either hand, presented\r\nherself before them, and graciously greeted them. Whereupon they rose,\r\nand returned her salutation with reverence, and caused her to sit down\r\namong them, and made much of her two little boys. But after some\r\ninterchange of gracious discourse, Messer Torello being withdrawn\r\nsomewhat apart, she asked them courteously, whence they came and whither\r\nthey were bound, and had of them the same answer that Messer Torello had\r\nreceived. \"So!\" quoth the lady with a joyful air, \"then I see that my\r\nwoman's wit will be of service to you; wherefore I pray you as a special\r\nfavour neither to reject nor to despise the little gift that I am about\r\nto present to you; but reflecting that, as women have but small minds, so\r\nthey make but small gifts, accept it, having regard rather to the good\r\nwill of the giver than the magnitude of the gift.\" She then caused bring\r\nforth for each of them two pair of robes, lined the one with silk, the\r\nother with vair, no such robes as citizens or merchants, but such as\r\nlords, use to wear, and three vests of taffeta, besides linen clothes,\r\nand:--\"Take them,\" quoth she. \"The robes I give you are even such as I\r\nhave arrayed my lord withal: the other things, considering that you are\r\nfar from your wives, and have come a long way, and have yet a long way to\r\ngo, and that merchants love to be neat and trim, may, albeit they are of\r\nno great value, be yet acceptable to you.\"\r\n\r\nWondering, the gentlemen acknowledged without reserve that there was no\r\npoint of courtesy wherein Messer Torello was not minded to acquit himself\r\ntowards them. And noting the lordly fashion of the robes, unsuited to the\r\nquality of merchants, they misdoubted that Messer Torello had recognized\r\nthem. However, quoth one of them to the lady:--\"Gifts great indeed are\r\nthese, Madam, nor such as lightly to accept, were it not that thereto we\r\nare constrained by your prayers, to which we may on no account say, no.\"\r\nWhereupon, Messer Torello being now come back, the lady bade them adieu,\r\nand took her leave of them; and in like manner did she cause their\r\nservants to be supplied with equipment suitable to them. The gentlemen,\r\nbeing much importuned thereto by Messer Torello, consented to tarry the\r\nrest of the day with him; and so, having slept, they donned their robes,\r\nand rode a while with him about the city; and supper-time being come,\r\nthey feasted magnificently, and with a numerous and honourable company.\r\nAnd so in due time they betook them to rest; and at daybreak, being\r\nrisen, they found, in lieu of their jaded nags, three stout and excellent\r\npalfreys, and in like manner fresh and goodly mounts for their servants.\r\nWhich Saladin marking turned to his lords, and:--\"By God,\" quoth he,\r\n\"never was gentleman more complete and courteous and considerate than\r\nthis Messer Torello, and if the Christian kings are as kingly as he is\r\nknightly, there is none of them whose onset the Soldan of Babylon might\r\nwell abide, to say nought of so many as we see making ready to fall upon\r\nhim.\" However, knowing that 'twas not permissible to refuse, he very\r\ncourteously thanked Messer Torello: and so they got them to horse. Messer\r\nTorello with a numerous company escorted them far beyond the gate of the\r\ncity, until, loath though Saladin was to part from him, so greatly did he\r\nnow affect him, yet as he must needs speed on, he besought him to turn\r\nback. Whereupon, albeit it irked him to take leave of them:--\"Gentlemen,\"\r\nquoth Messer Torello, \"since such is your pleasure, I obey; but this I\r\nmust say to you. Who you are I know not, nor would I know more than you\r\nare pleased to impart; but whoever you may be, you will not make me\r\nbelieve that you are merchants this while; and so adieu!\" To whom\r\nSaladin, having already taken leave of all his company, thus made\r\nanswer:--\"Peradventure, Sir, we shall one day give you to see somewhat of\r\nour merchandise, and thereby confirm your belief: and so adieu!\"\r\n\r\nThus parted Saladin and his company from Messer Torello, Saladin burning\r\nwith an exceeding great desire, if life should be continued to him, and\r\nthe war, which he anticipated, should not undo him, to shew Messer\r\nTorello no less honour than he had received at his hands, and conversing\r\nnot a little with his lords both of Messer Torello himself and of his\r\nlady, and all that he did and that in any wise concerned him, ever more\r\nhighly commending them. However, having with much diligence spied out all\r\nthe West, he put to sea, and returned with his company to Alexandria; and\r\nhaving now all needful information, he put himself in a posture of\r\ndefence. Messer Torello, his mind full of his late guests, returned to\r\nPavia; but, though he long pondered who they might be, he came never at\r\nor anywhere near the truth.\r\n\r\nThen with great and general mustering of forces came the time for\r\nembarking on the emprise, and Messer Torello, heeding not the tearful\r\nentreaties of his wife, resolved to join therein. So, being fully\r\nequipped and about to take horse, he said to his lady, whom he most\r\ndearly loved:--\"Wife, for honour's sake and for the weal of my soul, I\r\ngo, as thou seest, on this emprise: our substance and our honour I\r\ncommend to thy care. Certain I am of my departure, but, for the thousand\r\naccidents that may ensue, certitude have I none of my return: wherefore I\r\nwould have thee do me this grace, that, whatever be my fate, shouldst\r\nthou lack certain intelligence that I live, thou wilt expect me a year\r\nand a month and a day from this my departure, before thou marry again.\"\r\nWhereto the lady, weeping bitterly, made answer:--\"Messer Torello, I know\r\nnot how I shall support the distress in which, thus departing, you leave\r\nme; but should my life not fail beneath it, and aught befall thee, live\r\nand die secure that I shall live and die the wife of Messer Torello, and\r\nof his memory.\" Whereupon:--\"Wife,\" returned Messer Torello, \"well\r\nassured I am that, so far as in thee shall lie, this promise of thine\r\nwill be kept; but thou art young, and fair, and of a great family, and\r\nthy virtue is rare and generally known: wherefore I make no doubt that,\r\nshould there be any suspicion of my death, thou wilt be asked of thy\r\nbrothers and kinsmen by many a great gentleman: against whose attacks,\r\nthough thou desire it never so, thou wilt not be able to hold out, but\r\nwilt perforce be fain to gratify one or other of them; for which cause it\r\nis that I ask thee to wait just so long and no longer.\" \"As I have said,\"\r\nreplied the lady, \"so, in so far as I may, I shall do; and if I must\r\nneeds do otherwise, rest assured that of this your behest I shall render\r\nyou obedience. But I pray God that He bring neither you nor me to such a\r\nstrait yet a while.\" Which said, the lady wept, and having embraced\r\nMesser Torello, drew from her finger a ring, and gave it to him,\r\nsaying:--\"Should it betide that I die before I see you again, mind you of\r\nme, when you look upon it.\"\r\n\r\nMesser Torello took the ring, and got him to horse, and having bidden all\r\nadieu, fared forth on his journey; and being arrived with his company at\r\nGenoa, he embarked on a galley, and having departed thence, in no long\r\ntime arrived at Acre, and joined the main Christian host; wherein there\r\nby and by broke out an exceeding great and mortal sickness; during which,\r\nwhether owing to Saladin's strategy, or his good fortune, he made an easy\r\ncapture of well-nigh all the remnant of the Christians that were escaped,\r\nand quartered them in divers prisons in many cities; of which captives\r\nMesser Torello being one, was brought to Alexandria and there confined.\r\nWhere, not being known, and fearing to make himself known, he, under\r\nconstraint of necessity, applied him to the training of hawks, whereof he\r\nwas a very great master; and thereby he fell under the notice of Saladin,\r\nwho took him out of the prison, and made him his falconer. The Soldan\r\ncalled him by no other name than \"Christian,\" and neither recognized, nor\r\nwas recognized by, him, who, his whole soul ever in Pavia, essayed many a\r\ntime to escape, that he might return thither, but still without success:\r\nwherefore, certain Genoese, that were come to Alexandria as ambassadors\r\nto the Soldan for the redemption of some of their townsfolk, being about\r\nto return, he resolved to write to his lady, how that he lived, and would\r\ncome back to her, as soon as he might, and that she should expect his\r\nreturn; and having so done, he earnestly besought one of the ambassadors,\r\nwhom he knew, to see that the letter reached the hands of the Abbot of\r\nSan Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, who was his uncle.\r\n\r\nNow, such being the posture of Messer Torello's affairs, it befell one\r\nday that, while he talked with Saladin of his hawks, he smiled; whereby\r\nhis mouth shaped itself in a fashion, of which Saladin had taken\r\nparticular note, while he was at Pavia. And so, recalling Messer Torello\r\nto mind, he fixed his gaze upon him, and it seemed to him that 'twas\r\nindeed Messer Torello; wherefore, leaving the matter of which they were\r\nconversing:--\"Tell me, Christian,\" quoth he, \"of what country art thou in\r\nthe West?\" \"My lord,\" replied Messer Torello, \"I am a Lombard, of a city\r\ncalled Pavia, a poor man, and of humble condition.\" Which when he heard,\r\nSaladin, well-nigh resolved of his doubt, said joyfully to himself:--\"God\r\nhas provided me with occasion meet to prove to this man what store I set\r\nby his courtesy;\" and without another word he brought him into a room\r\nwhere he kept all his wearing apparel, and said:--\"Look, Christian, if\r\namong these robes there be any that thou hast ever seen before.\" So\r\nMesser Torello examined the robes, and espied those which his lady had\r\ngiven to Saladin; but, deeming they could not be the same, he\r\nreplied:--\"My lord, there is no robe here that I recognize, albeit 'tis\r\ntrue that those two robes are such as I once wore myself, in company with\r\nthree merchants that came to my house.\" Whereupon Saladin could refrain\r\nhimself no longer; but, tenderly embracing him:--\"You,\" quoth he, \"are\r\nMesser Torello d'Istria, and I am one of those three merchants to whom\r\nyour lady gave these robes; and now is the time to warrant you of the\r\nquality of my merchandise, as, when I parted from you, I told you might\r\ncome to pass.\" Which to hear, Messer Torello was at once overjoyed and\r\nabashed, overjoyed to have entertained so illustrious a guest, and\r\nabashed, for that it seemed to him that he had given him but a sorry\r\nentertainment. To whom:--\"Messer Torello,\" quoth Saladin, \"since hither\r\nhas God sent you to me, deem that 'tis no more I that am lord here, but\r\nyou.\" And so they made great cheer together; and then Saladin caused\r\nMesser Torello to be royally arrayed; and presented him to all his\r\ngreatest lords, and having extolled his merit in no stinted measure, bade\r\nall, as they hoped for grace from him, honour Messer Torello even as\r\nhimself. And so from that hour did they all; but most especially the two\r\nlords that had been with Saladin at Messer Torello's house.\r\n\r\nThe glory, to which Messer Torello thus suddenly found himself raised,\r\nsomewhat diverted his mind from the affairs of Lombardy, and the more so,\r\nfor that he entertained no doubt that his letter had reached his uncle's\r\nhands. But for that in the camp, or rather army, of the Christians, on\r\nthe day when they were taken by Saladin, there died and was buried one\r\nMesser Torello de Dignes, an obscure knight of Provence, whereas Messer\r\nTorello d'Istria was known to all the host for a right noble gentleman,\r\nwhoso heard tell that Messer Torello was dead, supposed that 'twas Messer\r\nTorello d'Istria, and not Messer Torello de Dignes; nor did what happened\r\nafter, to wit, the capture, avail to undeceive them; for not a few\r\nItalians had carried the report home with them; among whom there were\r\nsome who made bold to say that they had seen Messer Torello d'Istria's\r\ndead body, and had been present at its interment. Which rumour coming to\r\nthe ears of his lady and his kinsfolk, great indeed, nay, immeasurable\r\nwas the distress that it occasioned not only to them, but to all that had\r\nknown him. The mode and measure of his lady's grief, her mourning, her\r\nlamentation, 'twere tedious to describe. Enough that, after some months\r\nspent in almost unmitigated tribulation, her sorrow shewed signs of\r\nabatement; whereupon, suit being made for her hand by some of the\r\ngreatest men of Lombardy, her brothers and other kinsfolk began to\r\nimportune her to marry again. Times not a few, and with floods of tears,\r\nshe refused; but, overborne at last, she consented to do as they would\r\nhave her, upon the understanding that she was to remain unmarried until\r\nthe term for which she had bound herself to Messer Torello was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nNow the lady's affairs being in this posture at Pavia, it befell that\r\nsome eight days or so before the time appointed for her marriage, Messer\r\nTorello one day espied in Alexandria one that he had observed go with the\r\nGenoese ambassadors aboard the galley that took them to Genoa; wherefore\r\nhe called him, and asked him what sort of a voyage they had had, and when\r\nthey had reached Genoa. \"My lord,\" replied the other, \"the galley made\r\nbut a sorry voyage of it, as I learned in Crete, where I remained; for\r\nthat, while she was nearing Sicily, there arose a terrible gale from the\r\nNorth that drove her on to the shoals of Barbary, and never a soul\r\nescaped, and among the rest my two brothers were lost.\" Which report\r\nbelieving--and 'twas indeed most true--and calling to mind that in a few\r\ndays the term that he had asked of his wife would be fulfilled, and\r\nsurmising that there could be no tidings of him at Pavia, Messer Torello\r\nmade no question but that the lady was provided with another husband;\r\nwhereby he sank into such a depth of woe that he lost all power to eat,\r\nand betook him to his bed and resigned himself to die. Which when\r\nSaladin, by whom he was most dearly beloved, learned, he came to him, and\r\nhaving plied him with many and most instant entreaties, learned at length\r\nthe cause of his distress and sickness; and, having chidden him not a\r\nlittle that he had not sooner apprised him thereof, he besought him to\r\nput on a cheerful courage, assuring him, that, if so he did, he would\r\nbring it to pass that he should be in Pavia at the time appointed, and\r\ntold him how. Believing Saladin's words the more readily that he had many\r\ntimes heard that 'twas possible, and had not seldom been done, Messer\r\nTorello recovered heart, and was instant with Saladin that he should make\r\nall haste.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Saladin bade one of his necromancers, of whose skill he had\r\nalready had proof, to devise a method whereby Messer Torello should be\r\ntransported abed in a single night to Pavia: the necromancer made answer\r\nthat it should be done, but that 'twere best he put Messer Torello to\r\nsleep. The matter being thus arranged, Saladin hied him back to Messer\r\nTorello, and finding him most earnestly desirous to be in Pavia at the\r\ntime appointed, if so it might be, and if not, to die:--\"Messer Torello,\"\r\nquoth he, \"if you dearly love your lady, and misdoubt that she may become\r\nthe bride of another, no wise, God wot, do I censure you, for that, of\r\nall the ladies that ever I saw, she, for bearing, manners, and\r\naddress--to say nought of beauty, which is but the flower that\r\nperishes--seems to me the most worthy to be lauded and cherished. Much\r\nhad I been gratified, since Fortune has sent you hither to me, that,\r\nwhile you and I yet live, we had exercised equal lordship in the\r\ngovernance of this my realm, and, if such was not God's will, and this\r\nmust needs come upon you, that you are fain either to be at Pavia at the\r\ntime appointed or to die, I had desired of all things to have been\r\napprised thereof at such a time that I might have sent you home with such\r\nhonourable circumstance and state and escort as befit your high desert;\r\nwhich not being vouchsafed me, and as nought will content you but to be\r\nthere forthwith, I do what I can, and speed you thither on such wise as I\r\nhave told you.\" \"My lord,\" replied Messer Torello, \"had you said nought,\r\nyou have already done enough to prove your goodwill towards me, and that\r\nin so high a degree as is quite beyond my deserts, and most assured of\r\nthe truth of what you say shall I live and die, and so had done, had you\r\nnot said it; but, seeing that my resolve is taken, I pray you that that,\r\nwhich you promise to do, be done speedily, for that after to-morrow I may\r\nno longer count on being expected.\"\r\n\r\nSaladin assured him that 'twas so ordered that he should not be\r\ndisappointed. And on the morrow, it being his purpose to speed him on his\r\njourney that same night, he caused to be set up in one of his great halls\r\na most goodly and sumptuous bed composed of mattresses, all, as was their\r\nwont, of velvet and cloth of gold, and had it covered with a quilt,\r\nadorned at certain intervals with enormous pearls, and most rare precious\r\nstones, insomuch that 'twas in after time accounted a priceless treasure,\r\nand furnished with two pillows to match it. Which done, he bade array\r\nMesser Torello, who was now quite recovered, in a robe after the\r\nSaracenic fashion, the richest and goodliest thing of the kind that was\r\never seen, and wrap about his head, according to their wont, one of their\r\nhuge turbans. Then, at a late hour, Saladin, attended by certain of his\r\nlords, entered the chamber where Messer Torello was, and seating himself\r\nbeside him, all but wept as thus he began:--\"Messer Torello, the time is\r\nnigh at hand when you and I must part; wherefore, since I may neither\r\ngive you my own, nor others' company (the journey that you are about to\r\nmake not permitting it), I am come here, as 'tis fitting, in this chamber\r\nto take my leave of you. Wherefore, before I bid you adieu, I entreat\r\nyou, by that friendship, that love, which is between us, that you forget\r\nme not, and that, if it be possible, when you have settled your affairs\r\nin Lombardy, you come at least once, before our days are ended, to visit\r\nme, that thereby I may both have the delight of seeing you again, and\r\nmake good that omission which, by reason of your haste, I must needs now\r\nmake; and that in the meanwhile it irk thee not to visit me by letter,\r\nand to ask of me whatever you shall have a mind to, and be sure that\r\nthere lives not the man whom I shall content more gladly than you.\"\r\nMesser Torello could not refrain his tears, and so, with words few, and\r\nbroken by his sobs, he answered that 'twas impossible that the Soldan's\r\ngenerous deeds and chivalrous character should ever be forgotten by him,\r\nand that without fail he would do as he bade him, so soon as occasion\r\nshould serve him. Whereupon Saladin tenderly embraced and kissed him, and\r\nwith many a tear bade him adieu, and quitted the chamber. His lords then\r\ntook leave of Messer Torello, and followed Saladin into the hall, where\r\nhe had had the bed made ready.\r\n\r\n'Twas now late, and the necromancer being intent to hasten Messer\r\nTorello's transit, a physician brought him a potion, and having first\r\nshewn him what he was to give him by way of viaticum, caused him to drink\r\nit; and not long after he fell asleep. In which state he was carried by\r\nSaladin's command, and laid on the goodly bed, whereon he set a large and\r\nfair and most sumptuous crown, marking it in such sort that there could\r\nbe no mistake that it was sent by Saladin to Messer Torello's wife. He\r\nnext placed on Messer Torello's finger a ring, in which was set a\r\ncarbuncle of such brilliance that it shewed as a lighted torch, and of\r\nwell-nigh inestimable value. After which he girded on him a sword, the\r\nappointments of which might not readily be appraised. And therewithal he\r\nadorned him in front with a pendant, wherein were pearls, the like of\r\nwhich had never been seen, and not a few other rare jewels. And,\r\nmoreover, on either side of him he set two vast basins of gold full of\r\npistoles; and strings of pearls not a few, and rings and girdles, and\r\nother things, which 'twere tedious to enumerate, he disposed around him.\r\nWhich done, he kissed Messer Torello again, and bade the necromancer\r\nspeed him on his journey. Whereupon, forthwith, the bed, with Messer\r\nTorello thereon, was borne away from before Saladin's eyes, and he and\r\nhis barons remained conversing thereof.\r\n\r\nThe bed, as Messer Torello had requested, had already been deposited in\r\nthe church of San Piero in Ciel d'Oro at Pavia, and Messer Torello, with\r\nall the aforesaid jewels and ornaments upon and about him, was lying\r\nthereon, and still slept, when, upon the stroke of matins, the sacristan\r\ncame into the church, light in hand, and presently setting eyes on the\r\nsumptuous bed, was not only amazed, but mightily terrified, insomuch that\r\nhe turned back, and took to flight. Which the abbot and monks observing\r\nwith no small surprise, asked wherefore he fled and he told them.\r\nWhereupon:--\"Oh,\" quoth the abbot, \"thou art no longer a child, nor yet\r\nso new to this church, that thou shouldst so lightly be appalled: go we\r\nnow, and see who it is that has given thee this childish fright.\" So,\r\nwith a blaze of torches, the abbot, attended by his monks, entered the\r\nchurch, and espied this wondrous costly bed whereon the knight slept, and\r\nwhile, hesitant and fearful, daring not to approach the bed, they scanned\r\nthe rare and splendid jewels, it befell that, the efficacy of the potion\r\nbeing exhausted, Messer Torello awoke and heaved a great sigh. Whereat\r\nthe monks and the abbot quaking and crying out:--\"Lord, help us!\" one and\r\nall took to flight. Messer Torello, opening his eyes and looking about\r\nhim, saw, to his no small satisfaction, that without a doubt he was in\r\nthe very place where he had craved of Saladin to be; so up he sate, and\r\ntaking particular note of the matters with which he was surrounded,\r\naccounted the magnificence of Saladin to exceed even the measure, great\r\nthough it was, that he already knew. However, he still kept quiet, save\r\nthat, perceiving the monks in flight, and surmising the reason, he began\r\nto call the abbot by name, bidding him be of good courage, for that he\r\nwas his nephew, Torello. Whereat the abbot did but wax more terrified,\r\nfor that he deemed Torello had been many a month dead; but, after a\r\nwhile, as he heard himself still called, sound judgment got the better of\r\nhis fears, and making the sign of the cross, he drew nigh Torello; who\r\nsaid to him:--\"Father, what is't you fear? By God's grace I live, and\r\nhither am come back from overseas.\" Whom, for all he had grown a long\r\nbeard and was dressed in the Saracenic fashion, the abbot after a while\r\nrecognized, and now, quite reassured, took by the hand, saying:--\"Son,\r\nwelcome home:\" then:--\"No cause hast thou to marvel at our fears,\" he\r\nwent on, \"seeing that there is never a soul in these parts but firmly\r\nbelieves thee to be dead, insomuch that I may tell thee that Madonna\r\nAdalieta, thy wife, overborne by the entreaties and menaces of her\r\nkinsfolk, and against her will, is provided with another husband, to whom\r\nshe is this morning to go, and all is made ready for the nuptials and the\r\nattendant festivities.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Messer Torello, being risen from the sumptuous bed, did the\r\nabbot and the monks wondrous cheer, and besought them, one and all, to\r\ntell never a soul of his return, until he had completed something that he\r\nhad on hand. After which, having put the costly jewels in safe keeping,\r\nhe recounted to the abbot all the story of his adventures to that very\r\nhour. The abbot, rejoicing in his good fortune, joined with him in\r\noffering thanks to God. Messer Torello then asked him who might be his\r\nwife's new husband, and the abbot told him. Quoth then Messer\r\nTorello:--\"Before my return be known, I purpose to see how my wife will\r\ncomport herself at the nuptials: wherefore, though 'tis not the wont of\r\nmen of religion to go to such gatherings, I had lief that for love of me\r\nyou arranged for us to go thither together.\" The abbot answered that, he\r\nwould gladly do so, and as soon as 'twas day, he sent word to the\r\nbridegroom that he had thoughts of being present at his nuptials,\r\naccompanied by a friend; whereto the gentleman made answer that he was\r\nmuch gratified. So, at the breakfast hour Messer Torello, dressed as he\r\nwas, hied him with the abbot to the bridegroom's house, as many as saw\r\nthem gazing on him with wonder, but none recognizing him, and the abbot\r\ngiving all to understand that he was a Saracen sent by the Soldan as\r\nambassador to the King of France. Messer Torello was accordingly seated\r\nat a table directly opposite that of his lady, whom he eyed with\r\nexceeding great delight, the more so that he saw that in her face which\r\nshewed him that she was chagrined by the nuptials. She in like manner\r\nfrom time to time bent her regard on him; howbeit, what with his long\r\nbeard, and his foreign garb, and her firm persuasion that he was dead,\r\nshe had still no sort of recollection of him. However, Messer Torello at\r\nlength deemed it time to make trial of her, whether she would remember\r\nhim; wherefore he took the ring that the lady had given, him on his\r\ndeparture, and keeping it close in the palm of his hand, he called to him\r\na page that waited upon her, and said to him:--\"Tell the bride from me\r\nthat 'tis the custom in my country, that, when a stranger, such as I,\r\neats with a bride, like herself, at her wedding-feast, she, in token that\r\nhe is welcome to her board, sends him the cup from which she herself\r\ndrinks, full of wine; and when the stranger has drunk his fill, he closes\r\nthe cup, and the bride drinks what is left therein.\"\r\n\r\nThe page carried the message to the lady, who, being of good\r\nunderstanding and manners, and supposing him to be some very great man,\r\nby way of shewing that she was gratified by his presence, commanded that\r\na gilt cup, that was on the table before her, should be rinsed, and\r\nfilled with wine, and borne to the gentleman. Which being done, Messer\r\nTorello, having privily conveyed her ring into his mouth, let it fall\r\n(while he drank) into the cup on such wise that none wist thereof; and\r\nleaving but a little wine at the bottom, closed the cup and returned it\r\nto the lady; who, having taken it, that she might do full honour to the\r\ncustom of her guest's country, lifted the lid, and set the cup to her\r\nmouth; whereby espying the ring, she thereon mutely gazed a while, and\r\nrecognizing it for that which she had given Messer Torello on his\r\ndeparture, she steadfastly regarded the supposed stranger, whom now she\r\nalso recognized. Whereupon well-nigh distracted, oversetting the table in\r\nfront of her, she exclaimed:--\"'Tis my lord, 'tis verily Messer Torello;\"\r\nand rushing to the table at which he sate, giving never a thought to her\r\napparel, or aught that was on the table, she flung herself upon it; and\r\nreaching forward as far as she could, she threw her arms about him, and\r\nhugged him; nor, for aught that any said or did, could she be induced to\r\nrelease his neck, until Messer Torello himself bade her forbear a while,\r\nfor that she would have time enough to kiss him thereafter. The lady then\r\nstood up, and for a while all was disorder, albeit the feast was yet more\r\ngladsome than before by reason of the recovery of so honourable a knight:\r\nthen, at Messer Torello's entreaty, all were silent, while he recounted\r\nto them the story of his adventures from the day of his departure to that\r\nhour, concluding by saying that the gentleman who, deeming him to be\r\ndead, had taken his lady to wife, ought not to be affronted, if he, being\r\nalive, reclaimed her. The bridegroom, albeit he was somewhat crestfallen,\r\nmade answer in frank and friendly sort, that 'twas for Messer Torello to\r\ndo what he liked with his own. The lady resigned the ring and the crown\r\nthat her new spouse had given her, and put on the ring she had taken from\r\nthe cup, and likewise the crown sent her by the Soldan; and so, forth\r\nthey hied them, and with full nuptial pomp wended their way to Messer\r\nTorello's house; and there for a great while they made merry with his\r\nlate disconsolate friends and kinsfolk and all the citizens, who\r\naccounted his restoration as little short of a miracle.\r\n\r\nMesser Torello, having bestowed part of his rare jewels upon him who had\r\nborne the cost of the wedding-feast, and part on the abbot, and many\r\nother folk; and having by more than one messenger sent word of his safe\r\nhome-coming and prosperous estate to Saladin, acknowledging himself ever\r\nhis friend and vassal, lived many years thereafter with his worthy lady,\r\nacquitting himself yet more courteously than of yore. Such, then, was the\r\nend of the troubles of Messer Torello and his dear lady, and such the\r\nreward of their cheerful and ready courtesies.\r\n\r\nNow some there are that strive to do offices of courtesy, and have the\r\nmeans, but do them with so ill a grace, that, ere they are done, they\r\nhave in effect sold them at a price above their worth: wherefore, if no\r\nreward ensue to them thereof, neither they nor other folk have cause to\r\nmarvel.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEL X.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThe Marquis of Saluzzo, overborne by the entreaties of his vassals,\r\nconsents to take a wife, but, being minded to please himself in the\r\nchoice of her, takes a husbandman's daughter. He has two children by her,\r\nboth of whom he makes her believe that he has put to death. Afterward,\r\nfeigning to be tired of her, and to have taken another wife, he turns her\r\nout of doors in her shift, and brings his daughter into the house in\r\nguise of his bride; but, finding her patient under it all, he brings her\r\nhome again, and shews her her children, now grown up, and honours her,\r\nand causes her to be honoured, as Marchioness.\r\n--\r\n\r\nEnded the king's long story, with which all seemed to be very well\r\npleased, quoth Dioneo with a laugh:--\"The good man that looked that night\r\nto cause the bogey's tail to droop, would scarce have contributed two\r\npennyworth of all the praise you bestow on Messer Torello:\" then, witting\r\nthat it now only remained for him to tell, thus he began:--Gentle my\r\nladies, this day, meseems, is dedicate to Kings and Soldans and folk of\r\nthe like quality; wherefore, that I stray not too far from you, I am\r\nminded to tell you somewhat of a Marquis; certes, nought magnificent, but\r\na piece of mad folly, albeit there came good thereof to him in the end.\r\nThe which I counsel none to copy, for that great pity 'twas that it\r\nturned out well with him.\r\n\r\nThere was in olden days a certain Marquis of Saluzzo, Gualtieri by name,\r\na young man, but head of the house, who, having neither wife nor child,\r\npassed his time in nought else but in hawking and hunting, and of taking\r\na wife and begetting children had no thought; wherein he should have been\r\naccounted very wise: but his vassals, brooking it ill, did oftentimes\r\nentreat him to take a wife, that he might not die without an heir, and\r\nthey be left without a lord; offering to find him one of such a pattern,\r\nand of such parentage, that he might marry with good hope, and be well\r\ncontent with the sequel. To whom:--\"My friends,\" replied Gualtieri, \"you\r\nenforce me to that which I had resolved never to do, seeing how hard it\r\nis to find a wife, whose ways accord well with one's own, and how\r\nplentiful is the supply of such as run counter thereto, and how grievous\r\na life he leads who chances upon a lady that matches ill with him. And to\r\nsay that you think to know the daughters by the qualities of their\r\nfathers and mothers, and thereby--so you would argue--to provide me with\r\na wife to my liking, is but folly; for I wot not how you may penetrate\r\nthe secrets of their mothers so as to know their fathers; and granted\r\nthat you do know them, daughters oftentimes resemble neither of their\r\nparents. However, as you are minded to rivet these fetters upon me, I am\r\ncontent that so it be; and that I may have no cause to reproach any but\r\nmyself, should it turn out ill, I am resolved that my wife shall be of my\r\nown choosing; but of this rest assured, that, no matter whom I choose, if\r\nshe receive not from you the honour due to a lady, you shall prove to\r\nyour great cost, how sorely I resent being thus constrained by your\r\nimportunity to take a wife against my will.\"\r\n\r\nThe worthy men replied that they were well content, so only he would\r\nmarry without more ado. And Gualtieri, who had long noted with approval\r\nthe mien of a poor girl that dwelt on a farm hard by his house, and found\r\nher fair enough, deemed that with her he might pass a tolerably happy\r\nlife. Wherefore he sought no further, but forthwith resolved to marry\r\nher; and having sent for her father, who was a very poor man, he\r\ncontracted with him to take her to wife. Which done, Gualtieri assembled\r\nall the friends he had in those parts, and:--\"My friends,\" quoth he, \"you\r\nwere and are minded that I should take a wife, and rather to comply with\r\nyour wishes, than for any desire that I had to marry, I have made up my\r\nmind to do so. You remember the promise you gave me, to wit, that,\r\nwhomsoever I should take, you would pay her the honour due to a lady.\r\nWhich promise I now require you to keep, the time being come when I am to\r\nkeep mine. I have found hard by here a maiden after mine own heart, whom\r\nI purpose to take to wife, and to bring hither to my house in the course\r\nof a few days. Wherefore bethink you, how you may make the nuptial feast\r\nsplendid, and welcome her with all honour; that I may confess myself\r\nsatisfied with your observance of your promise, as you will be with my\r\nobservance of mine.\" The worthy men, one and all, answered with alacrity\r\nthat they were well content, and that, whoever she might be, they would\r\nentreat her as a lady, and pay her all due honour as such. After which,\r\nthey all addressed them to make goodly and grand and gladsome celebration\r\nof the event, as did also Gualtieri. He arranged for a wedding most\r\nstately and fair, and bade thereto a goodly number of his friends and\r\nkinsfolk, and great gentlemen, and others, of the neighbourhood; and\r\ntherewithal he caused many a fine and costly robe to be cut and fashioned\r\nto the figure of a girl who seemed to him of the like proportions as the\r\ngirl that he purposed to wed; and laid in store, besides, of girdles and\r\nrings, with a costly and beautiful crown, and all the other paraphernalia\r\nof a bride.\r\n\r\nThe day that he had appointed for the wedding being come, about half\r\ntierce he got him to horse with as many as had come to do him honour, and\r\nhaving made all needful dispositions:--\"Gentlemen,\" quoth he, \"'tis time\r\nto go bring home the bride.\" And so away he rode with his company to the\r\nvillage; where, being come to the house of the girl's father, they found\r\nher returning from the spring with a bucket of water, making all the\r\nhaste she could, that she might afterwards go with the other women to see\r\nGualtieri's bride come by. Whom Gualtieri no sooner saw, than he called\r\nher by her name, to wit, Griselda, and asked her where her father was. To\r\nwhom she modestly made answer:--\"My lord, he is in the house.\" Whereupon\r\nGualtieri dismounted, and having bidden the rest await him without,\r\nentered the cottage alone; and meeting her father, whose name was\r\nGiannucolo:--\"I am come,\" quoth he, \"to wed Griselda, but first of all\r\nthere are some matters I would learn from her own lips in thy presence.\"\r\nHe then asked her, whether, if he took her to wife, she would study to\r\ncomply with his wishes, and be not wroth, no matter what he might say or\r\ndo, and be obedient, with not a few other questions of a like sort: to\r\nall which she answered, ay. Whereupon Gualtieri took her by the hand, led\r\nher forth, and before the eyes of all his company, and as many other folk\r\nas were there, caused her to strip naked, and let bring the garments that\r\nhe had had fashioned for her, and had her forthwith arrayed therein, and\r\nupon her unkempt head let set a crown; and then, while all\r\nwondered:--\"Gentlemen,\" quoth he, \"this is she whom I purpose to make my\r\nwife, so she be minded to have me for husband.\" Then, she standing\r\nabashed and astonied, he turned to her, saying:--\"Griselda, wilt thou\r\nhave me for thy husband?\" To whom:--\"Ay, my lord,\" answered she. \"And I\r\nwill have thee to wife,\" said he, and married her before them all. And\r\nhaving set her upon a palfrey, he brought her home with pomp.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was fair and stately, and had he married a daughter of the\r\nKing of France, the feast could not have been more splendid. It seemed as\r\nif, with the change of her garb, the bride had acquired a new dignity of\r\nmind and mien. She was, as we have said, fair of form and feature; and\r\ntherewithal she was now grown so engaging and gracious and debonair, that\r\nshe shewed no longer as the shepherdess, and the daughter of Giannucolo,\r\nbut as the daughter of some noble lord, insomuch that she caused as many\r\nas had known her before to marvel. Moreover, she was so obedient and\r\ndevoted to her husband, that he deemed himself the happiest and luckiest\r\nman in the world. And likewise so gracious and kindly was she to her\r\nhusband's vassals, that there was none of them but loved her more dearly\r\nthan himself, and was zealous to do her honour, and prayed for her\r\nwelfare and prosperity and aggrandisement, and instead of, as erstwhile,\r\nsaying that Gualtieri had done foolishly to take her to wife, now averred\r\nthat he had not his like in the world for wisdom and discernment, for\r\nthat, save to him, her noble qualities would ever have remained hidden\r\nunder her sorry apparel and the garb of the peasant girl. And in short\r\nshe so comported herself as in no long time to bring it to pass that, not\r\nonly in the marquisate, but far and wide besides, her virtues and her\r\nadmirable conversation were matter of common talk, and, if aught had been\r\nsaid to the disadvantage of her husband, when he married her, the\r\njudgment was now altogether to the contrary effect.\r\n\r\nShe had not been long with Gualtieri before she conceived; and in due\r\ntime she was delivered of a girl; whereat Gualtieri made great cheer.\r\nBut, soon after, a strange humour took possession of him, to wit, to put\r\nher patience to the proof by prolonged and intolerable hard usage;\r\nwherefore he began by afflicting her with his gibes, putting on a vexed\r\nair, and telling her that his vassals were most sorely dissatisfied with\r\nher by reason of her base condition, and all the more so since they saw\r\nthat she was a mother, and that they did nought but most ruefully murmur\r\nat the birth of a daughter. Whereto Griselda, without the least change of\r\ncountenance or sign of discomposure, made answer:--\"My lord, do with me\r\nas thou mayst deem best for thine own honour and comfort, for well I wot\r\nthat I am of less account than they, and unworthy of this honourable\r\nestate to which of thy courtesy thou hast advanced me.\" By which answer\r\nGualtieri was well pleased, witting that she was in no degree puffed up\r\nwith pride by his, or any other's, honourable entreatment of her. A while\r\nafterwards, having in general terms given his wife to understand that the\r\nvassals could not endure her daughter, he sent her a message by a\r\nservant. So the servant came, and:--\"Madam,\" quoth he with a most\r\ndolorous mien, \"so I value my life, I must needs do my lord's bidding. He\r\nhas bidden me take your daughter and...\" He said no more, but the lady by\r\nwhat she heard, and read in his face, and remembered of her husband's\r\nwords, understood that he was bidden to put the child to death. Whereupon\r\nshe presently took the child from the cradle, and having kissed and\r\nblessed her, albeit she was very sore at heart, she changed not\r\ncountenance, but placed it in the servant's arms, saying:--\"See that thou\r\nleave nought undone that my lord and thine has charged thee to do, but\r\nleave her not so that the beasts and the birds devour her, unless he have\r\nso bidden thee.\" So the servant took the child, and told Gualtieri what\r\nthe lady had said; and Gualtieri, marvelling at her constancy, sent him\r\nwith the child to Bologna, to one of his kinswomen, whom he besought to\r\nrear and educate the child with all care, but never to let it be known\r\nwhose child she was.\r\n\r\nSoon after it befell that the lady again conceived, and in due time was\r\ndelivered of a son, whereat Gualtieri was overjoyed. But, not content\r\nwith what he had done, he now even more poignantly afflicted the lady;\r\nand one day with a ruffled mien:--\"Wife,\" quoth he, \"since thou gavest\r\nbirth to this boy, I may on no wise live in peace with my vassals, so\r\nbitterly do they reproach me that a grandson of Giannucolo is to succeed\r\nme as their lord; and therefore I fear that, so I be not minded to be\r\nsent a packing hence, I must even do herein as I did before, and in the\r\nend put thee away, and take another wife.\" The lady heard him patiently,\r\nand answered only:--\"My lord, study how thou mayst content thee and best\r\nplease thyself, and waste no thought upon me, for there is nought I\r\ndesire save in so far as I know that 'tis thy pleasure.\" Not many days\r\nafter, Gualtieri, in like manner as he had sent for the daughter, sent\r\nfor the son, and having made a shew of putting him to death, provided for\r\nhis, as for the girl's, nurture at Bologna. Whereat the lady shewed no\r\nmore discomposure of countenance or speech than at the loss of her\r\ndaughter: which Gualtieri found passing strange, and inly affirmed that\r\nthere was never another woman in the world that would have so done. And\r\nbut that he had marked that she was most tenderly affectionate towards\r\nher children, while 'twas well pleasing to him, he had supposed that she\r\nwas tired of them, whereas he knew that 'twas of her discretion that she\r\nso did. His vassals, who believed that he had put the children to death,\r\nheld him mightily to blame for his cruelty, and felt the utmost\r\ncompassion for the lady. She, however, said never aught to the ladies\r\nthat condoled with her on the death of her children, but that the\r\npleasure of him that had begotten them was her pleasure likewise.\r\n\r\nYears not a few had passed since the girl's birth, when Gualtieri at\r\nlength deemed the time come to put his wife's patience to the final\r\nproof. Accordingly, in the presence of a great company of his vassals he\r\ndeclared that on no wise might he longer brook to have Griselda to wife,\r\nthat he confessed that in taking her he had done a sorry thing and the\r\nact of a stripling, and that he therefore meant to do what he could to\r\nprocure the Pope's dispensation to put Griselda away, and take another\r\nwife: for which cause being much upbraided by many worthy men, he made no\r\nother answer but only that needs must it so be. Whereof the lady being\r\napprised, and now deeming that she must look to go back to her father's\r\nhouse, and perchance tend the sheep, as she had aforetime, and see him,\r\nto whom she was utterly devoted, engrossed by another woman, did inly\r\nbewail herself right sorely: but still with the same composed mien with\r\nwhich she had borne Fortune's former buffets, she set herself to endure\r\nthis last outrage. Nor was it long before Gualtieri by counterfeit\r\nletters, which he caused to be sent to him from Rome, made his vassals\r\nbelieve that the Pope had thereby given him a dispensation to put\r\nGriselda away, and take another wife. Wherefore, having caused her to be\r\nbrought before him, he said to her in the presence of not a few:--\"Wife,\r\nby license granted me by the Pope, I am now free to put thee away, and\r\ntake another wife; and, for that my forbears have always been great\r\ngentlemen and lords of these parts, whereas thine have ever been\r\nhusbandmen, I purpose that thou go back to Giannucolo's house with the\r\ndowry that thou broughtest me; whereupon I shall bring home a lady that I\r\nhave found, and who is meet to be my wife.\"\r\n\r\n'Twas not without travail most grievous that the lady, as she heard this\r\nannouncement, got the better of her woman's nature, and suppressing her\r\ntears, made answer:--\"My lord, I ever knew that my low degree was on no\r\nwise congruous with your nobility, and acknowledged that the rank I had\r\nwith you was of your and God's bestowal, nor did I ever make as if it\r\nwere mine by gift, or so esteem it, but still accounted it as a loan.\r\n'Tis your pleasure to recall it, and therefore it should be, and is, my\r\npleasure to render it up to you. So, here is your ring, with which you\r\nespoused me; take it back. You bid me take with me the dowry that I\r\nbrought you; which to do will require neither paymaster on your part nor\r\npurse nor packhorse on mine; for I am not unmindful that naked was I when\r\nyou first had me. And if you deem it seemly that that body in which I\r\nhave borne children, by you begotten, be beheld of all, naked will I\r\ndepart; but yet, I pray you, be pleased, in guerdon of the virginity that\r\nI brought you and take not away, to suffer me to bear hence upon my back\r\na single shift--I crave no more--besides my dowry.\" There was nought of\r\nwhich Gualtieri was so fain as to weep; but yet, setting his face as a\r\nflint, he made answer:--\"I allow thee a shift to thy back; so get thee\r\nhence.\" All that stood by besought him to give her a robe, that she, who\r\nhad been his wife for thirteen years and more, might not be seen to quit\r\nhis house in so sorry and shameful a plight, having nought on her but a\r\nshift. But their entreaties went for nothing: the lady in her shift, and\r\nbarefoot and bareheaded, having bade them adieu, departed the house, and\r\nwent back to her father amid the tears and lamentations of all that saw\r\nher. Giannucolo, who had ever deemed it a thing incredible that Gualtieri\r\nshould keep his daughter to wife, and had looked for this to happen every\r\nday, and had kept the clothes that she had put off on the morning that\r\nGualtieri had wedded her, now brought them to her; and she, having\r\nresumed them, applied herself to the petty drudgery of her father's\r\nhouse, as she had been wont, enduring with fortitude this cruel\r\nvisitation of adverse Fortune.\r\n\r\nNow no sooner had Gualtieri dismissed Griselda, than he gave his vassals\r\nto understand that he had taken to wife a daughter of one of the Counts\r\nof Panago. He accordingly made great preparations as for the nuptials,\r\nduring which he sent for Griselda. To whom, being come, quoth he:--\"I am\r\nbringing hither my new bride, and in this her first home-coming I purpose\r\nto shew her honour; and thou knowest that women I have none in the house\r\nthat know how to set chambers in due order, or attend to the many other\r\nmatters that so joyful an event requires; wherefore do thou, that\r\nunderstandest these things better than another, see to all that needs be\r\ndone, and bid hither such ladies as thou mayst see fit, and receive them,\r\nas if thou wert the lady of the house, and then, when the nuptials are\r\nended, thou mayst go back to thy cottage.\" Albeit each of these words\r\npierced Griselda's heart like a knife, for that, in resigning her good\r\nfortune, she had not been able to renounce the love she bore Gualtieri,\r\nnevertheless:--\"My lord,\" she made answer, \"I am ready and prompt to do\r\nyour pleasure.\" And so, clad in her sorry garments of coarse romagnole,\r\nshe entered the house, which, but a little before, she had quitted in her\r\nshift, and addressed her to sweep the chambers, and arrange arras and\r\ncushions in the halls, and make ready the kitchen, and set her hand to\r\neverything, as if she had been a paltry serving-wench: nor did she rest\r\nuntil she had brought all into such meet and seemly trim as the occasion\r\ndemanded. This done, she invited in Gualtieri's name all the ladies of\r\nthose parts to be present at his nuptials, and awaited the event. The day\r\nbeing come, still wearing her sorry weeds, but in heart and soul and mien\r\nthe lady, she received the ladies as they came, and gave each a gladsome\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\nNow Gualtieri, as we said, had caused his children to be carefully\r\nnurtured and brought up by a kinswoman of his at Bologna, which kinswoman\r\nwas married into the family of the Counts of Panago; and, the girl being\r\nnow twelve years old, and the loveliest creature that ever was seen, and\r\nthe boy being about six years old, he had sent word to his kinswoman's\r\nhusband at Bologna, praying him to be pleased to come with this girl and\r\nboy of his to Saluzzo, and to see that he brought a goodly and honourable\r\ncompany with him, and to give all to understand that he brought the girl\r\nto him to wife, and on no wise to disclose to any, who she really was.\r\nThe gentleman did as the Marquis bade him, and within a few days of his\r\nsetting forth arrived at Saluzzo about breakfast-time with the girl, and\r\nher brother, and a noble company, and found all the folk of those parts,\r\nand much people besides, gathered there in expectation of Gualtieri's new\r\nbride. Who, being received by the ladies, was no sooner come into the\r\nhall, where the tables were set, than Griselda advanced to meet her,\r\nsaying with hearty cheer:--\"Welcome, my lady.\" So the ladies, who had\r\nwith much instance, but in vain, besought Gualtieri, either to let\r\nGriselda keep in another room, or at any rate to furnish her with one of\r\nthe robes that had been hers, that she might not present herself in such\r\na sorry guise before the strangers, sate down to table; and the service\r\nbeing begun, the eyes of all were set on the girl, and every one said\r\nthat Gualtieri had made a good exchange, and Griselda joined with the\r\nrest in greatly commending her, and also her little brother. And now\r\nGualtieri, sated at last with all that he had seen of his wife's\r\npatience, marking that this new and strange turn made not the least\r\nalteration in her demeanour, and being well assured that 'twas not due to\r\napathy, for he knew her to be of excellent understanding, deemed it time\r\nto relieve her of the suffering which he judged her to dissemble under a\r\nresolute front; and so, having called her to him in presence of them all,\r\nhe said with a smile:--\"And what thinkst thou of our bride?\" \"My lord,\"\r\nreplied Griselda, \"I think mighty well of her; and if she be but as\r\ndiscreet as she is fair--and so I deem her--I make no doubt but you may\r\nreckon to lead with her a life of incomparable felicity; but with all\r\nearnestness I entreat you, that you spare her those tribulations which\r\nyou did once inflict upon another that was yours, for I scarce think she\r\nwould be able to bear them, as well because she is younger, as for that\r\nshe has been delicately nurtured, whereas that other had known no respite\r\nof hardship since she was but a little child.\" Marking that she made no\r\ndoubt but that the girl was to be his wife, and yet spoke never a whit\r\nthe less sweetly, Gualtieri caused her to sit down beside him,\r\nand:--\"Griselda,\" said he, \"'tis now time that thou see the reward of thy\r\nlong patience, and that those, who have deemed me cruel and unjust and\r\ninsensate, should know that what I did was done of purpose aforethought,\r\nfor that I was minded to give both thee and them a lesson, that thou\r\nmightst learn to be a wife, and they in like manner might learn how to\r\ntake and keep a wife, and that I might beget me perpetual peace with thee\r\nfor the rest of my life; whereof being in great fear, when I came to take\r\na wife, lest I should be disappointed, I therefore, to put the matter to\r\nthe proof, did, and how sorely thou knowest, harass and afflict thee. And\r\nsince I never knew thee either by deed or by word to deviate from my\r\nwill, I now, deeming myself to have of thee that assurance of happiness\r\nwhich I desired, am minded to restore to thee at once all that, step by\r\nstep, I took from thee, and by extremity of joy to compensate the\r\ntribulations that I inflicted on thee. Receive, then, this girl, whom\r\nthou supposest to be my bride, and her brother, with glad heart, as thy\r\nchildren and mine. These are they, whom by thee and many another it has\r\nlong been supposed that I did ruthlessly to death, and I am thy husband,\r\nthat loves thee more dearly than aught else, deeming that other there is\r\nnone that has the like good cause to be well content with his wife.\"\r\n\r\nWhich said, he embraced and kissed her; and then, while she wept for joy,\r\nthey rose and hied them there where sate the daughter, all astonied to\r\nhear the news, whom, as also her brother, they tenderly embraced, and\r\nexplained to them, and many others that stood by, the whole mystery.\r\nWhereat the ladies, transported with delight, rose from table and betook\r\nthem with Griselda to a chamber, and, with better omen, divested her of\r\nher sorry garb, and arrayed her in one of her own robes of state; and so,\r\nin guise of a lady (howbeit in her rags she had shewed as no less) they\r\nled her back into the hall. Wondrous was the cheer which there they made\r\nwith the children; and, all overjoyed at the event, they revelled and\r\nmade merry amain, and prolonged the festivities for several days; and\r\nvery discreet they pronounced Gualtieri, albeit they censured as\r\nintolerably harsh the probation to which he had subjected Griselda, and\r\nmost discreet beyond all compare they accounted Griselda.\r\n\r\nSome days after, the Count of Panago returned to Bologna, and Gualtieri\r\ntook Giannucolo from his husbandry, and established him in honour as his\r\nfather-in-law, wherein to his great solace he lived for the rest of his\r\ndays. Gualtieri himself, having mated his daughter with a husband of high\r\ndegree, lived long and happily thereafter with Griselda, to whom he ever\r\npaid all honour.\r\n\r\nNow what shall we say in this case but that even into the cots of the\r\npoor the heavens let fall at times spirits divine, as into the palaces of\r\nkings souls that are fitter to tend hogs than to exercise lordship over\r\nmen? Who but Griselda had been able, with a countenance not only\r\ntearless, but cheerful, to endure the hard and unheard-of trials to which\r\nGualtieri subjected her? Who perhaps might have deemed himself to have\r\nmade no bad investment, had he chanced upon one, who, having been turned\r\nout of his house in her shift, had found means so to dust the pelisse of\r\nanother as to get herself thereby a fine robe.\r\n\r\nSo ended Dioneo's story, whereof the ladies, diversely inclining, one to\r\ncensure where another found matter for commendation, had discoursed not a\r\nlittle, when the king, having glanced at the sky, and marked that the sun\r\nwas now low, insomuch that 'twas nigh the vesper hour, still keeping his\r\nseat, thus began:--\"Exquisite my ladies, as, methinks, you wot, 'tis not\r\nonly in minding them of the past and apprehending the present that the\r\nwit of mortals consists; but by one means or the other to be able to\r\nforesee the future is by the sages accounted the height of wisdom. Now,\r\nto-morrow, as you know, 'twill be fifteen days since, in quest of\r\nrecreation and for the conservation of our health and life, we, shunning\r\nthe dismal and dolorous and afflicting spectacles that have ceased not in\r\nour city since this season of pestilence began, took our departure from\r\nFlorence. Wherein, to my thinking, we have done nought that was not\r\nseemly; for, if I have duly used my powers of observation, albeit some\r\ngay stories, and of a kind to stimulate concupiscence, have here been\r\ntold, and we have daily known no lack of dainty dishes and good wine, nor\r\nyet of music and song, things, one and all, apt to incite weak minds to\r\nthat which is not seemly, neither on your part, nor on ours, have I\r\nmarked deed or word, or aught of any kind, that called for reprehension;\r\nbut, by what I have seen and heard, seemliness and the sweet intimacy of\r\nbrothers and sisters have ever reigned among us. Which, assuredly, for\r\nthe honour and advantage which you and I have had thereof, is most\r\ngrateful to me. Wherefore, lest too long continuance in this way of life\r\nmight beget some occasion of weariness, and that no man may be able to\r\nmisconstrue our too long abidance here, and as we have all of us had our\r\nday's share of the honour which still remains in me, I should deem it\r\nmeet, so you be of like mind, that we now go back whence we came: and\r\nthat the rather that our company, the bruit whereof has already reached\r\ndivers others that are in our neighbourhood, might be so increased that\r\nall our pleasure would be destroyed. And so, if my counsel meet with your\r\napproval, I will keep the crown I have received of you until our\r\ndeparture, which, I purpose, shall be tomorrow morning. Should you decide\r\notherwise, I have already determined whom to crown for the ensuing day.\"\r\n\r\nMuch debate ensued among the ladies and young men; but in the end they\r\napproved the king's proposal as expedient and seemly; and resolved to do\r\neven as he had said. The king therefore summoned the seneschal; and\r\nhaving conferred with him of the order he was to observe on the morrow,\r\nhe dismissed the company until supper-time. So, the king being risen, the\r\nladies and the rest likewise rose, and betook them, as they were wont, to\r\ntheir several diversions. Supper-time being come, they supped with\r\nexceeding great delight. Which done, they addressed them to song and\r\nmusic and dancing; and, while Lauretta was leading a dance, the king bade\r\nFiammetta give them a song; whereupon Fiammetta right debonairly sang on\r\nthis wise:--\r\n\r\nSo came but Love, and brought no jealousy,\r\n  So blithe, I wot, as I,\r\n  Dame were there none, be she whoe'er she be.\r\n\r\nIf youth's fresh, lusty pride\r\n  May lady of her lover well content,\r\n  Or valour's just renown,\r\n  Hardihood, prowess tried,\r\n  Wit, noble mien, discourse most excellent,\r\n  And of all grace the crown;\r\n  That she am I, who, fain for love to swoun,\r\n  There where my hope doth lie\r\n  These several virtues all conjoined do see.\r\n\r\nBut, for that I less wise\r\n  Than me no whit do other dames discern,\r\n  Trembling with sore dismay,\r\n  I still the worst surmise,\r\n  Deeming their hearts with the same flame to burn\r\n  That of mine maketh prey:\r\n  Wherefore of him that is my hope's one stay\r\n  Disconsolate I sigh,\r\n  Yea mightily, and daily do me dree.\r\n\r\nIf but my lord as true\r\n  As worthy to be loved I might approve,\r\n  I were not jealous then:\r\n  But, for that charmer new\r\n  Doth all too often gallant lure to love,\r\n  Forsworn I hold all men,\r\n  And sick at heart I am, of death full fain;\r\n  Nor lady doth him eye,\r\n  But I do quake, lest she him wrest from me.\r\n\r\n'Fore God, then, let each she\r\n  List to my prayer, nor e'er in my despite\r\n  Such grievous wrong essay;\r\n  For should there any be\r\n  That by or speech or mien's allurements light\r\n  Of him to rob me may\r\n  Study or plot, I, witting, shall find way,\r\n  My beauty it aby!\r\n  To cause her sore lament such frenesie.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Fiammetta had ended her song, Dioneo, who was beside her, said\r\nwith a laugh:--\"Madam, 'twould be a great courtesy on your part to do all\r\nladies to wit, who he is, that he be not stolen from you in ignorance,\r\nseeing that you threaten such dire resentment.\" Several other songs\r\nfollowed; and it being then nigh upon midnight, all, as the king was\r\npleased to order, betook them to rest. With the first light of the new\r\nday they rose, and, the seneschal having already conveyed thence all\r\ntheir chattels, they, following the lead of their discreet king, hied\r\nthem back to Florence; and in Santa Maria Novella, whence they had set\r\nforth, the three young men took leave of the seven ladies, and departed\r\nto find other diversions elsewhere, while the ladies in due time repaired\r\nto their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR'S EPILOGUE.\r\n\r\nMost noble damsels, for whose solace I addressed me to this long and\r\ntoilsome task, meseems that, aided by the Divine grace, the bestowal\r\nwhereof I impute to the efficacy of your pious prayers, and in no wise to\r\nmerits of mine, I have now brought this work to the full and perfect\r\nconsummation which in the outset thereof I promised you. Wherefore, it\r\nbut remains for me to render, first to God, and then to you, my thanks,\r\nand so to give a rest to my pen and weary hand. But this I purpose not to\r\nallow them, until, briefly, as to questions tacitly mooted--for well\r\nassured I am that these stories have no especial privilege above any\r\nothers, nay, I forget not that at the beginning of the Fourth Day I have\r\nmade the same plain--I shall have answered certain trifling objections\r\nthat one of you, maybe, or some other, might advance. Peradventure, then,\r\nsome of you will be found to say that I have used excessive license in\r\nthe writing of these stories, in that I have caused ladies at times to\r\ntell, and oftentimes to list, matters that, whether to tell or to list,\r\ndo not well beseem virtuous women. The which I deny, for that there is\r\nnone of these stories so unseemly, but that it may without offence be\r\ntold by any one, if but seemly words be used; which rule, methinks, has\r\nhere been very well observed. But assume we that 'tis even so (for with\r\nyou I am not minded to engage in argument, witting that you would\r\nvanquish me), then, I say that for answer why I have so done, reasons\r\nmany come very readily to hand. In the first place, if aught of the kind\r\nin any of these stories there be, 'twas but such as was demanded by the\r\ncharacter of the stories, which let but any person of sound judgment scan\r\nwith the eye of reason, and 'twill be abundantly manifest that, unless I\r\nhad been minded to deform them, they could not have been otherwise\r\nrecounted. And if, perchance, they do, after all, contain here and there\r\na trifling indiscretion of speech, such as might ill sort with one of\r\nyour precious prudes, who weigh words rather than deeds, and are more\r\nconcerned to appear, than to be, good, I say that so to write was as\r\npermissible to me, as 'tis to men and women at large in their converse to\r\nmake use of such terms as hole, and pin, and mortar, and pestle, and\r\nsausage, and polony, and plenty more besides of a like sort. And\r\ntherewithal privilege no less should be allowed to my pen than to the\r\npencil of the painter, who without incurring any, or at least any just,\r\ncensure, not only will depict St. Michael smiting the serpent, or St.\r\nGeorge the dragon, with sword or lance at his discretion; but male he\r\npaints us Christ, and female Eve, and His feet that for the salvation of\r\nour race willed to die upon the cross he fastens thereto, now with one,\r\nnow with two nails.\r\n\r\nMoreover, 'tis patent to all that 'twas not in the Church, of matters\r\nwhereto pertaining 'tis meet we speak with all purity of heart and\r\nseemliness of phrase, albeit among her histories there are to be found\r\nnot a few that will ill compare with my writings; nor yet in the schools\r\nof the philosophers, where, as much as anywhere, seemliness is demanded,\r\nnor in any place where clergy or philosophers congregate, but in gardens,\r\nin pleasaunces, and among folk, young indeed, but not so young as to be\r\nseducible by stories, and at a time when, if so one might save one's\r\nlife, the most sedate might without disgrace walk abroad with his\r\nbreeches for headgear, that these stories were told. Which stories, such\r\nas they are, may, like all things else, be baneful or profitable\r\naccording to the quality of the hearer. Who knows not that wine is, as\r\nCinciglione and Scolaio(1) and many another aver, an excellent thing for\r\nthe living creature, and yet noxious to the fevered patient? Are we, for\r\nthe mischief it does to the fever-stricken, to say that 'tis a bad thing?\r\nWho knows not that fire is most serviceable, nay, necessary, to mortals?\r\nAre we to say that, because it burns houses and villages and cities, it\r\nis a bad thing? Arms, in like manner, are the safeguard of those that\r\ndesire to live in peace, and also by them are men not seldom maliciously\r\nslain, albeit the malice is not in them, but in those that use them for a\r\nmalicious purpose. Corrupt mind did never yet understand any word in a\r\nwholesome sense; and as such a mind has no profit of seemly words, so\r\nsuch as are scarce seemly may as little avail to contaminate a healthy\r\nmind as mud the radiance of the sun, or the deformities of earth the\r\nsplendours of the heavens. What books, what words, what letters, are more\r\nsacred, more excellent, more venerable, than those of Holy Writ? And yet\r\nthere have been not a few that, perversely construing them, have brought\r\nthemselves and others to perdition. Everything is in itself good for\r\nsomewhat, and being put to a bad purpose, may work manifold mischief. And\r\nso, I say, it is with my stories. If any man shall be minded to draw from\r\nthem matters of evil tendency or consequence, they will not gainsay him,\r\nif, perchance, such matters there be in them, nor will such matters fail\r\nto be found in them, if they be wrested and distorted. Nor, if any shall\r\nseek profit and reward in them, will they deny him the same; and censured\r\nor accounted as less than profitable and seemly they can never be, if the\r\ntimes or the persons when and by whom they are read be such as when they\r\nwere recounted. If any lady must needs say paternosters or make cakes or\r\ntarts for her holy father, let her leave them alone; there is none after\r\nwhom they will run a begging to be read: howbeit, there are little\r\nmatters that even the beguines tell, ay, and do, now and again.\r\n\r\nIn like manner there will be some who will say that there are stories\r\nhere which 'twere better far had been omitted. Granted; but 'twas neither\r\nin my power, nor did it behove me, to write any but such stories as were\r\nnarrated; wherefore, 'twas for those by whom they were told to have a\r\ncare that they were proper; in which case they would have been no less so\r\nas I wrote them. But, assuming that I not only wrote but invented the\r\nstories, as I did not, I say that I should take no shame to myself that\r\nthey were not all proper; seeing that artist there is none to be found,\r\nsave God, that does all things well and perfectly. And Charlemagne,\r\nalbeit he created the Paladins, wist not how to make them in such numbers\r\nas to form an army of them alone. It must needs be that in the multitude\r\nof things there be found diversities of quality. No field was ever so\r\nwell tilled but that here and there nettle, or thistle, or brier would be\r\nfound in it amid the goodlier growths. Whereto I may add that, having to\r\naddress me to young and unlearned ladies, as you for the most part are, I\r\nshould have done foolishly, had I gone about searching and swinking to\r\nfind matters very exquisite, and been sedulous to speak with great\r\nprecision. However, whoso goes a reading among these stories, let him\r\npass over those that vex him, and read those that please him. That none\r\nmay be misled, each bears on its brow the epitome of that which it hides\r\nwithin its bosom.\r\n\r\nAgain, I doubt not there will be such as will say that some of the\r\nstories are too long. To whom, once more, I answer, that whoso has aught\r\nelse to do would be foolish to read them, albeit they were short. And\r\nthough, now that I approach the end of my labours, 'tis long since I\r\nbegan to write, I am not, therefore, oblivious that 'twas to none but\r\nleisured ladies that I made proffer of my pains; nor can aught be long to\r\nhim that reads but to pass the time, so only he thereby accomplish his\r\npurpose. Succinctness were rather to be desired by students, who are at\r\npains not merely to pass, but usefully to employ, their time, than by\r\nyou, who have as much time at your disposal as you spend not in amorous\r\ndelights. Besides which, as none of you goes either to Athens, or to\r\nBologna, or to Paris to study, 'tis meet that what is meant for you\r\nshould be more diffuse than what is to be read by those whose minds have\r\nbeen refined by scholarly pursuits.\r\n\r\nNor make I any doubt but there are yet others who will say that the said\r\nstories are too full of jests and merry conceits, and that it ill beseems\r\na man of weight and gravity to have written on such wise. To these I am\r\nbound to render, and do render, my thanks, for that, prompted by\r\nwell-meant zeal, they have so tender a regard to my reputation. But to\r\nthat, which they urge against me, I reply after this sort:--That I am of\r\nweight I acknowledge, having been often weighed in my time; wherefore, in\r\nanswer to the fair that have not weighed me, I affirm that I am not of\r\ngravity; on the contrary I am so light that I float on the surface of the\r\nwater; and considering that the sermons which the friars make, when they\r\nwould chide folk for their sins, are to-day, for the most part, full of\r\njests and merry conceits, and drolleries, I deemed that the like stuff\r\nwould not ill beseem my stories, written, as they were, to banish women's\r\ndumps. However, if thereby they should laugh too much, they may be\r\nreadily cured thereof by the Lament of Jeremiah, the Passion of the\r\nSaviour, or the Complaint of the Magdalen.\r\n\r\nAnd who shall question but that yet others there are who will say that I\r\nhave an evil tongue and venomous, because here and there I tell the truth\r\nabout the friars? Now for them that so say there is forgiveness, for that\r\n'tis not to be believed but that they have just cause; seeing that the\r\nfriars are good folk, and eschew hardship for the love of God, and grind\r\nintermittently, and never blab; and, were they not all a trifle\r\nmalodorous, intercourse with them would be much more agreeable.\r\nNevertheless, I acknowledge that the things of this world have no\r\nstability, but are ever undergoing change; and this may have befallen my\r\ntongue, albeit, no great while ago, one of my fair neighbours--for in\r\nwhat pertains to myself I trust not my own judgment, but forgo it to the\r\nbest of my power--told me 'twas the goodliest and sweetest tongue in the\r\nworld; and in sooth, when this occurred, few of the said stories were yet\r\nto write; nor, for that those who so tax me do it despitefully, am I\r\nminded to vouchsafe them any further answer.\r\n\r\nSo, then, be every lady at liberty to say and believe whatever she may\r\nthink fit: but 'tis now time for me to bring these remarks to a close,\r\nwith humble thanks to Him, by whose help and guidance I, after so long\r\ntravail, have been brought to the desired goal. And may you, sweet my\r\nladies, rest ever in His grace and peace; and be not unmindful of me, if,\r\nperadventure, any of you may, in any measure, have been profited by\r\nreading these stories.\r\n\r\n(1) Noted topers of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nEndeth here the tenth and last day of the book called Decameron,\r\notherwise Prince Galeotto.\r\n--\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Decameron, Vol. II., by Giovanni Boccaccio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DECAMERON, VOLUME II ***\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n"}
