A Foggy Night and Morning\u2014Conclusion\r\n\r\n Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reprinting this story for a new edition I am reminded that it was in\r\nthe chapters of \u201CFar from the Madding Crowd,\u201D as they appeared month by\r\nmonth in a popular magazine, that I first ventured to adopt the word\r\n\u201CWessex\u201D from the pages of early English history, and give it a\r\nfictitious significance as the existing name of the district once\r\nincluded in that extinct kingdom. The series of novels I projected\r\nbeing mainly of the kind called local, they seemed to require a\r\nterritorial definition of some sort to lend unity to their scene.\r\nFinding that the area of a single county did not afford a canvas large\r\nenough for this purpose, and that there were objections to an invented\r\nname, I disinterred the old one. The press and the public were kind\r\nenough to welcome the fanciful plan, and willingly joined me in the\r\nanachronism of imagining a Wessex population living under Queen\r\nVictoria;\u2014a modern Wessex of railways, the penny post, mowing and\r\nreaping machines, union workhouses, lucifer matches, labourers who\r\ncould read and write, and National school children. But I believe I am\r\ncorrect in stating that, until the existence of this contemporaneous\r\nWessex was announced in the present story, in 1874, it had never been\r\nheard of, and that the expression, \u201Ca Wessex peasant,\u201D or \u201Ca Wessex\r\ncustom,\u201D would theretofore have been taken to refer to nothing later in\r\ndate than the Norman Conquest.\r\n\r\nI did not anticipate that this application of the word to a modern use\r\nwould extend outside the chapters of my own chronicles. But the name\r\nwas soon taken up elsewhere as a local designation. The first to do so\r\nwas the now defunct _Examiner_, which, in the impression bearing date\r\nJuly 15, 1876, entitled one of its articles \u201CThe Wessex Labourer,\u201D the\r\narticle turning out to be no dissertation on farming during the\r\nHeptarchy, but on the modern peasant of the south-west counties, and\r\nhis presentation in these stories.\r\n\r\nSince then the appellation which I had thought to reserve to the\r\nhorizons and landscapes of a merely realistic dream-country, has become\r\nmore and more popular as a practical definition; and the dream-country\r\nhas, by degrees, solidified into a utilitarian region which people can\r\ngo to, take a house in, and write to the papers from. But I ask all\r\ngood and gentle readers to be so kind as to forget this, and to refuse\r\nsteadfastly to believe that there are any inhabitants of a Victorian\r\nWessex outside the pages of this and the companion volumes in which\r\nthey were first discovered.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the village called Weatherbury, wherein the scenes of the\r\npresent story of the series are for the most part laid, would perhaps\r\nbe hardly discernible by the explorer, without help, in any existing\r\nplace nowadays; though at the time, comparatively recent, at which the\r\ntale was written, a sufficient reality to meet the descriptions, both\r\nof backgrounds and personages, might have been traced easily enough.\r\nThe church remains, by great good fortune, unrestored and intact, and a\r\nfew of the old houses; but the ancient malt-house, which was formerly\r\nso characteristic of the parish, has been pulled down these twenty\r\nyears; also most of the thatched and dormered cottages that were once\r\nlifeholds. The game of prisoner\u2019s base, which not so long ago seemed to\r\nenjoy a perennial vitality in front of the worn-out stocks, may, so far\r\nas I can say, be entirely unknown to the rising generation of\r\nschoolboys there. The practice of divination by Bible and key, the\r\nregarding of valentines as things of serious import, the\r\nshearing-supper, and the harvest-home, have, too, nearly disappeared in\r\nthe wake of the old houses; and with them have gone, it is said, much\r\nof that love of fuddling to which the village at one time was\r\nnotoriously prone. The change at the root of this has been the recent\r\nsupplanting of the class of stationary cottagers, who carried on the\r\nlocal traditions and humours, by a population of more or less migratory\r\nlabourers, which has led to a break of continuity in local history,\r\nmore fatal than any other thing to the preservation of legend,\r\nfolk-lore, close inter-social relations, and eccentric individualities.\r\nFor these the indispensable conditions of existence are attachment to\r\nthe soil of one particular spot by generation after generation.\r\n\r\nT. H.\r\n\r\nFebruary 1895\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nDescription of Farmer Oak\u2014An Incident\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Farmer Oak smiled, the corners of his mouth spread till they were\r\nwithin an unimportant distance of his ears, his eyes were reduced to\r\nchinks, and diverging wrinkles appeared round them, extending upon his\r\ncountenance like the rays in a rudimentary sketch of the rising sun.\r\n\r\nHis Christian name was Gabriel, and on working days he was a young man\r\nof sound judgment, easy motions, proper dress, and general good\r\ncharacter. On Sundays he was a man of misty views, rather given to\r\npostponing, and hampered by his best clothes and umbrella: upon the\r\nwhole, one who felt himself to occupy morally that vast middle space of\r\nLaodicean neutrality which lay between the Communion people of the\r\nparish and the drunken section,\u2014that is, he went to church, but yawned\r\nprivately by the time the congregation reached the Nicene creed, and\r\nthought of what there would be for dinner when he meant to be listening\r\nto the sermon. Or, to state his character as it stood in the scale of\r\npublic opinion, when his friends and critics were in tantrums, he was\r\nconsidered rather a bad man; when they were pleased, he was rather a\r\ngood man; when they were neither, he was a man whose moral colour was a\r\nkind of pepper-and-salt mixture.\r\n\r\nSince he lived six times as many working-days as Sundays, Oak\u2019s\r\nappearance in his old clothes was most peculiarly his own\u2014the mental\r\npicture formed by his neighbours in imagining him being always dressed\r\nin that way. He wore a low-crowned felt hat, spread out at the base by\r\ntight jamming upon the head for security in high winds, and a coat like\r\nDr. Johnson\u2019s; his lower extremities being encased in ordinary leather\r\nleggings and boots emphatically large, affording to each foot a roomy\r\napartment so constructed that any wearer might stand in a river all day\r\nlong and know nothing of damp\u2014their maker being a conscientious man who\r\nendeavoured to compensate for any weakness in his cut by unstinted\r\ndimension and solidity.\r\n\r\nMr. Oak carried about him, by way of watch, what may be called a small\r\nsilver clock; in other words, it was a watch as to shape and intention,\r\nand a small clock as to size. This instrument being several years older\r\nthan Oak\u2019s grandfather, had the peculiarity of going either too fast or\r\nnot at all. The smaller of its hands, too, occasionally slipped round\r\non the pivot, and thus, though the minutes were told with precision,\r\nnobody could be quite certain of the hour they belonged to. The\r\nstopping peculiarity of his watch Oak remedied by thumps and shakes,\r\nand he escaped any evil consequences from the other two defects by\r\nconstant comparisons with and observations of the sun and stars, and by\r\npressing his face close to the glass of his neighbours\u2019 windows, till\r\nhe could discern the hour marked by the green-faced timekeepers within.\r\nIt may be mentioned that Oak\u2019s fob being difficult of access, by reason\r\nof its somewhat high situation in the waistband of his trousers (which\r\nalso lay at a remote height under his waistcoat), the watch was as a\r\nnecessity pulled out by throwing the body to one side, compressing the\r\nmouth and face to a mere mass of ruddy flesh on account of the exertion\r\nrequired, and drawing up the watch by its chain, like a bucket from a\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nBut some thoughtful persons, who had seen him walking across one of his\r\nfields on a certain December morning\u2014sunny and exceedingly mild\u2014might\r\nhave regarded Gabriel Oak in other aspects than these. In his face one\r\nmight notice that many of the hues and curves of youth had tarried on\r\nto manhood: there even remained in his remoter crannies some relics of\r\nthe boy. His height and breadth would have been sufficient to make his\r\npresence imposing, had they been exhibited with due consideration. But\r\nthere is a way some men have, rural and urban alike, for which the mind\r\nis more responsible than flesh and sinew: it is a way of curtailing\r\ntheir dimensions by their manner of showing them. And from a quiet\r\nmodesty that would have become a vestal, which seemed continually to\r\nimpress upon him that he had no great claim on the world\u2019s room, Oak\r\nwalked unassumingly and with a faintly perceptible bend, yet distinct\r\nfrom a bowing of the shoulders. This may be said to be a defect in an\r\nindividual if he depends for his valuation more upon his appearance\r\nthan upon his capacity to wear well, which Oak did not.\r\n\r\nHe had just reached the time of life at which \u201Cyoung\u201D is ceasing to be\r\nthe prefix of \u201Cman\u201D in speaking of one. He was at the brightest period\r\nof masculine growth, for his intellect and his emotions were clearly\r\nseparated: he had passed the time during which the influence of youth\r\nindiscriminately mingles them in the character of impulse, and he had\r\nnot yet arrived at the stage wherein they become united again, in the\r\ncharacter of prejudice, by the influence of a wife and family. In\r\nshort, he was twenty-eight, and a bachelor.\r\n\r\nThe field he was in this morning sloped to a ridge called Norcombe\r\nHill. Through a spur of this hill ran the highway between Emminster and\r\nChalk-Newton. Casually glancing over the hedge, Oak saw coming down the\r\nincline before him an ornamental spring waggon, painted yellow and\r\ngaily marked, drawn by two horses, a waggoner walking alongside bearing\r\na whip perpendicularly. The waggon was laden with household goods and\r\nwindow plants, and on the apex of the whole sat a woman, young and\r\nattractive. Gabriel had not beheld the sight for more than half a\r\nminute, when the vehicle was brought to a standstill just beneath his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe tailboard of the waggon is gone, Miss,\u201D said the waggoner.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen I heard it fall,\u201D said the girl, in a soft, though not\r\nparticularly low voice. \u201CI heard a noise I could not account for when\r\nwe were coming up the hill.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll run back.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo,\u201D she answered.\r\n\r\nThe sensible horses stood\u2014perfectly still, and the waggoner\u2019s steps\r\nsank fainter and fainter in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe girl on the summit of the load sat motionless, surrounded by tables\r\nand chairs with their legs upwards, backed by an oak settle, and\r\nornamented in front by pots of geraniums, myrtles, and cactuses,\r\ntogether with a caged canary\u2014all probably from the windows of the house\r\njust vacated. There was also a cat in a willow basket, from the\r\npartly-opened lid of which she gazed with half-closed eyes, and\r\naffectionately surveyed the small birds around.\r\n\r\nThe handsome girl waited for some time idly in her place, and the only\r\nsound heard in the stillness was the hopping of the canary up and down\r\nthe perches of its prison. Then she looked attentively downwards. It\r\nwas not at the bird, nor at the cat; it was at an oblong package tied\r\nin paper, and lying between them. She turned her head to learn if the\r\nwaggoner were coming. He was not yet in sight; and her eyes crept back\r\nto the package, her thoughts seeming to run upon what was inside it. At\r\nlength she drew the article into her lap, and untied the paper\r\ncovering; a small swing looking-glass was disclosed, in which she\r\nproceeded to survey herself attentively. She parted her lips and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine morning, and the sun lighted up to a scarlet glow the\r\ncrimson jacket she wore, and painted a soft lustre upon her bright face\r\nand dark hair. The myrtles, geraniums, and cactuses packed around her\r\nwere fresh and green, and at such a leafless season they invested the\r\nwhole concern of horses, waggon, furniture, and girl with a peculiar\r\nvernal charm. What possessed her to indulge in such a performance in\r\nthe sight of the sparrows, blackbirds, and unperceived farmer who were\r\nalone its spectators,\u2014whether the smile began as a factitious one, to\r\ntest her capacity in that art,\u2014nobody knows; it ended certainly in a\r\nreal smile. She blushed at herself, and seeing her reflection blush,\r\nblushed the more.\r\n\r\nThe change from the customary spot and necessary occasion of such an\r\nact\u2014from the dressing hour in a bedroom to a time of travelling out of\r\ndoors\u2014lent to the idle deed a novelty it did not intrinsically possess.\r\nThe picture was a delicate one. Woman\u2019s prescriptive infirmity had\r\nstalked into the sunlight, which had clothed it in the freshness of an\r\noriginality. A cynical inference was irresistible by Gabriel Oak as he\r\nregarded the scene, generous though he fain would have been. There was\r\nno necessity whatever for her looking in the glass. She did not adjust\r\nher hat, or pat her hair, or press a dimple into shape, or do one thing\r\nto signify that any such intention had been her motive in taking up the\r\nglass. She simply observed herself as a fair product of Nature in the\r\nfeminine kind, her thoughts seeming to glide into far-off though likely\r\ndramas in which men would play a part\u2014vistas of probable triumphs\u2014the\r\nsmiles being of a phase suggesting that hearts were imagined as lost\r\nand won. Still, this was but conjecture, and the whole series of\r\nactions was so idly put forth as to make it rash to assert that\r\nintention had any part in them at all.\r\n\r\nThe waggoner\u2019s steps were heard returning. She put the glass in the\r\npaper, and the whole again into its place.\r\n\r\nWhen the waggon had passed on, Gabriel withdrew from his point of\r\nespial, and descending into the road, followed the vehicle to the\r\nturnpike-gate some way beyond the bottom of the hill, where the object\r\nof his contemplation now halted for the payment of toll. About twenty\r\nsteps still remained between him and the gate, when he heard a dispute.\r\nIt was a difference concerning twopence between the persons with the\r\nwaggon and the man at the toll-bar.\r\n\r\n\u201CMis\u2019ess\u2019s niece is upon the top of the things, and she says that\u2019s\r\nenough that I\u2019ve offered ye, you great miser, and she won\u2019t pay any\r\nmore.\u201D These were the waggoner\u2019s words.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well; then mis\u2019ess\u2019s niece can\u2019t pass,\u201D said the turnpike-keeper,\r\nclosing the gate.\r\n\r\nOak looked from one to the other of the disputants, and fell into a\r\nreverie. There was something in the tone of twopence remarkably\r\ninsignificant. Threepence had a definite value as money\u2014it was an\r\nappreciable infringement on a day\u2019s wages, and, as such, a higgling\r\nmatter; but twopence\u2014\u201CHere,\u201D he said, stepping forward and handing\r\ntwopence to the gatekeeper; \u201Clet the young woman pass.\u201D He looked up at\r\nher then; she heard his words, and looked down.\r\n\r\nGabriel\u2019s features adhered throughout their form so exactly to the\r\nmiddle line between the beauty of St. John and the ugliness of Judas\r\nIscariot, as represented in a window of the church he attended, that\r\nnot a single lineament could be selected and called worthy either of\r\ndistinction or notoriety. The red-jacketed and dark-haired maiden\r\nseemed to think so too, for she carelessly glanced over him, and told\r\nher man to drive on. She might have looked her thanks to Gabriel on a\r\nminute scale, but she did not speak them; more probably she felt none,\r\nfor in gaining her a passage he had lost her her point, and we know how\r\nwomen take a favour of that kind.\r\n\r\nThe gatekeeper surveyed the retreating vehicle. \u201CThat\u2019s a handsome\r\nmaid,\u201D he said to Oak.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut she has her faults,\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue, farmer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd the greatest of them is\u2014well, what it is always.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBeating people down? ay, \u2019tis so.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CO no.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat, then?\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel, perhaps a little piqued by the comely traveller\u2019s\r\nindifference, glanced back to where he had witnessed her performance\r\nover the hedge, and said, \u201CVanity.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nNIGHT\u2014THE FLOCK\u2014AN INTERIOR\u2014ANOTHER INTERIOR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight on the eve of St. Thomas\u2019s, the shortest day in\r\nthe year. A desolating wind wandered from the north over the hill\r\nwhereon Oak had watched the yellow waggon and its occupant in the\r\nsunshine of a few days earlier.\r\n\r\nNorcombe Hill\u2014not far from lonely Toller-Down\u2014was one of the spots\r\nwhich suggest to a passer-by that he is in the presence of a shape\r\napproaching the indestructible as nearly as any to be found on earth.\r\nIt was a featureless convexity of chalk and soil\u2014an ordinary specimen\r\nof those smoothly-outlined protuberances of the globe which may remain\r\nundisturbed on some great day of confusion, when far grander heights\r\nand dizzy granite precipices topple down.\r\n\r\nThe hill was covered on its northern side by an ancient and decaying\r\nplantation of beeches, whose upper verge formed a line over the crest,\r\nfringing its arched curve against the sky, like a mane. To-night these\r\ntrees sheltered the southern slope from the keenest blasts, which smote\r\nthe wood and floundered through it with a sound as of grumbling, or\r\ngushed over its crowning boughs in a weakened moan. The dry leaves in\r\nthe ditch simmered and boiled in the same breezes, a tongue of air\r\noccasionally ferreting out a few, and sending them spinning across the\r\ngrass. A group or two of the latest in date amongst the dead multitude\r\nhad remained till this very mid-winter time on the twigs which bore\r\nthem and in falling rattled against the trunks with smart taps.\r\n\r\nBetween this half-wooded half-naked hill, and the vague still horizon\r\nthat its summit indistinctly commanded, was a mysterious sheet of\r\nfathomless shade\u2014the sounds from which suggested that what it concealed\r\nbore some reduced resemblance to features here. The thin grasses, more\r\nor less coating the hill, were touched by the wind in breezes of\r\ndiffering powers, and almost of differing natures\u2014one rubbing the\r\nblades heavily, another raking them piercingly, another brushing them\r\nlike a soft broom. The instinctive act of humankind was to stand and\r\nlisten, and learn how the trees on the right and the trees on the left\r\nwailed or chaunted to each other in the regular antiphonies of a\r\ncathedral choir; how hedges and other shapes to leeward then caught the\r\nnote, lowering it to the tenderest sob; and how the hurrying gust then\r\nplunged into the south, to be heard no more.\r\n\r\nThe sky was clear\u2014remarkably clear\u2014and the twinkling of all the stars\r\nseemed to be but throbs of one body, timed by a common pulse. The North\r\nStar was directly in the wind\u2019s eye, and since evening the Bear had\r\nswung round it outwardly to the east, till he was now at a right angle\r\nwith the meridian. A difference of colour in the stars\u2014oftener read of\r\nthan seen in England\u2014was really perceptible here. The sovereign\r\nbrilliancy of Sirius pierced the eye with a steely glitter, the star\r\ncalled Capella was yellow, Aldebaran and Betelgueux shone with a fiery\r\nred.\r\n\r\nTo persons standing alone on a hill during a clear midnight such as\r\nthis, the roll of the world eastward is almost a palpable movement. The\r\nsensation may be caused by the panoramic glide of the stars past\r\nearthly objects, which is perceptible in a few minutes of stillness, or\r\nby the better outlook upon space that a hill affords, or by the wind,\r\nor by the solitude; but whatever be its origin, the impression of\r\nriding along is vivid and abiding. The poetry of motion is a phrase\r\nmuch in use, and to enjoy the epic form of that gratification it is\r\nnecessary to stand on a hill at a small hour of the night, and, having\r\nfirst expanded with a sense of difference from the mass of civilised\r\nmankind, who are dreamwrapt and disregardful of all such proceedings at\r\nthis time, long and quietly watch your stately progress through the\r\nstars. After such a nocturnal reconnoitre it is hard to get back to\r\nearth, and to believe that the consciousness of such majestic speeding\r\nis derived from a tiny human frame.\r\n\r\nSuddenly an unexpected series of sounds began to be heard in this place\r\nup against the sky. They had a clearness which was to be found nowhere\r\nin the wind, and a sequence which was to be found nowhere in nature.\r\nThey were the notes of Farmer Oak\u2019s flute.\r\n\r\nThe tune was not floating unhindered into the open air: it seemed\r\nmuffled in some way, and was altogether too curtailed in power to\r\nspread high or wide. It came from the direction of a small dark object\r\nunder the plantation hedge\u2014a shepherd\u2019s hut\u2014now presenting an outline\r\nto which an uninitiated person might have been puzzled to attach either\r\nmeaning or use.\r\n\r\nThe image as a whole was that of a small Noah\u2019s Ark on a small Ararat,\r\nallowing the traditionary outlines and general form of the Ark which\r\nare followed by toy-makers\u2014and by these means are established in men\u2019s\r\nimaginations among their firmest, because earliest impressions\u2014to pass\r\nas an approximate pattern. The hut stood on little wheels, which raised\r\nits floor about a foot from the ground. Such shepherds\u2019 huts are\r\ndragged into the fields when the lambing season comes on, to shelter\r\nthe shepherd in his enforced nightly attendance.\r\n\r\nIt was only latterly that people had begun to call Gabriel \u201CFarmer\u201D\r\nOak. During the twelvemonth preceding this time he had been enabled by\r\nsustained efforts of industry and chronic good spirits to lease the\r\nsmall sheep-farm of which Norcombe Hill was a portion, and stock it\r\nwith two hundred sheep. Previously he had been a bailiff for a short\r\ntime, and earlier still a shepherd only, having from his childhood\r\nassisted his father in tending the flocks of large proprietors, till\r\nold Gabriel sank to rest.\r\n\r\nThis venture, unaided and alone, into the paths of farming as master\r\nand not as man, with an advance of sheep not yet paid for, was a\r\ncritical juncture with Gabriel Oak, and he recognised his position\r\nclearly. The first movement in his new progress was the lambing of his\r\newes, and sheep having been his speciality from his youth, he wisely\r\nrefrained from deputing the task of tending them at this season to a\r\nhireling or a novice.\r\n\r\nThe wind continued to beat about the corners of the hut, but the\r\nflute-playing ceased. A rectangular space of light appeared in the side\r\nof the hut, and in the opening the outline of Farmer Oak\u2019s figure. He\r\ncarried a lantern in his hand, and closing the door behind him, came\r\nforward and busied himself about this nook of the field for nearly\r\ntwenty minutes, the lantern light appearing and disappearing here and\r\nthere, and brightening him or darkening him as he stood before or\r\nbehind it.\r\n\r\nOak\u2019s motions, though they had a quiet energy, were slow, and their\r\ndeliberateness accorded well with his occupation. Fitness being the\r\nbasis of beauty, nobody could have denied that his steady swings and\r\nturns in and about the flock had elements of grace. Yet, although if\r\noccasion demanded he could do or think a thing with as mercurial a dash\r\nas can the men of towns who are more to the manner born, his special\r\npower, morally, physically, and mentally, was static, owing little or\r\nnothing to momentum as a rule.\r\n\r\nA close examination of the ground hereabout, even by the wan starlight\r\nonly, revealed how a portion of what would have been casually called a\r\nwild slope had been appropriated by Farmer Oak for his great purpose\r\nthis winter. Detached hurdles thatched with straw were stuck into the\r\nground at various scattered points, amid and under which the whitish\r\nforms of his meek ewes moved and rustled. The ring of the sheep-bell,\r\nwhich had been silent during his absence, recommenced, in tones that\r\nhad more mellowness than clearness, owing to an increasing growth of\r\nsurrounding wool. This continued till Oak withdrew again from the\r\nflock. He returned to the hut, bringing in his arms a new-born lamb,\r\nconsisting of four legs large enough for a full-grown sheep, united by\r\na seemingly inconsiderable membrane about half the substance of the\r\nlegs collectively, which constituted the animal\u2019s entire body just at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe little speck of life he placed on a wisp of hay before the small\r\nstove, where a can of milk was simmering. Oak extinguished the lantern\r\nby blowing into it and then pinching the snuff, the cot being lighted\r\nby a candle suspended by a twisted wire. A rather hard couch, formed of\r\na few corn sacks thrown carelessly down, covered half the floor of this\r\nlittle habitation, and here the young man stretched himself along,\r\nloosened his woollen cravat, and closed his eyes. In about the time a\r\nperson unaccustomed to bodily labour would have decided upon which side\r\nto lie, Farmer Oak was asleep.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the hut, as it now presented itself, was cosy and\r\nalluring, and the scarlet handful of fire in addition to the candle,\r\nreflecting its own genial colour upon whatever it could reach, flung\r\nassociations of enjoyment even over utensils and tools. In the corner\r\nstood the sheep-crook, and along a shelf at one side were ranged\r\nbottles and canisters of the simple preparations pertaining to ovine\r\nsurgery and physic; spirits of wine, turpentine, tar, magnesia, ginger,\r\nand castor-oil being the chief. On a triangular shelf across the corner\r\nstood bread, bacon, cheese, and a cup for ale or cider, which was\r\nsupplied from a flagon beneath. Beside the provisions lay the flute,\r\nwhose notes had lately been called forth by the lonely watcher to\r\nbeguile a tedious hour. The house was ventilated by two round holes,\r\nlike the lights of a ship\u2019s cabin, with wood slides.\r\n\r\nThe lamb, revived by the warmth, began to bleat, and the sound entered\r\nGabriel\u2019s ears and brain with an instant meaning, as expected sounds\r\nwill. Passing from the profoundest sleep to the most alert wakefulness\r\nwith the same ease that had accompanied the reverse operation, he\r\nlooked at his watch, found that the hour-hand had shifted again, put on\r\nhis hat, took the lamb in his arms, and carried it into the darkness.\r\nAfter placing the little creature with its mother, he stood and\r\ncarefully examined the sky, to ascertain the time of night from the\r\naltitudes of the stars.\r\n\r\nThe Dog-star and Aldebaran, pointing to the restless Pleiades, were\r\nhalf-way up the Southern sky, and between them hung Orion, which\r\ngorgeous constellation never burnt more vividly than now, as it soared\r\nforth above the rim of the landscape. Castor and Pollux with their\r\nquiet shine were almost on the meridian: the barren and gloomy Square\r\nof Pegasus was creeping round to the north-west; far away through the\r\nplantation Vega sparkled like a lamp suspended amid the leafless trees,\r\nand Cassiopeia\u2019s chair stood daintily poised on the uppermost boughs.\r\n\r\n\u201COne o\u2019clock,\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\nBeing a man not without a frequent consciousness that there was some\r\ncharm in this life he led, he stood still after looking at the sky as a\r\nuseful instrument, and regarded it in an appreciative spirit, as a work\r\nof art superlatively beautiful. For a moment he seemed impressed with\r\nthe speaking loneliness of the scene, or rather with the complete\r\nabstraction from all its compass of the sights and sounds of man. Human\r\nshapes, interferences, troubles, and joys were all as if they were not,\r\nand there seemed to be on the shaded hemisphere of the globe no\r\nsentient being save himself; he could fancy them all gone round to the\r\nsunny side.\r\n\r\nOccupied thus, with eyes stretched afar, Oak gradually perceived that\r\nwhat he had previously taken to be a star low down behind the outskirts\r\nof the plantation was in reality no such thing. It was an artificial\r\nlight, almost close at hand.\r\n\r\nTo find themselves utterly alone at night where company is desirable\r\nand expected makes some people fearful; but a case more trying by far\r\nto the nerves is to discover some mysterious companionship when\r\nintuition, sensation, memory, analogy, testimony, probability,\r\ninduction\u2014every kind of evidence in the logician\u2019s list\u2014have united to\r\npersuade consciousness that it is quite in isolation.\r\n\r\nFarmer Oak went towards the plantation and pushed through its lower\r\nboughs to the windy side. A dim mass under the slope reminded him that\r\na shed occupied a place here, the site being a cutting into the slope\r\nof the hill, so that at its back part the roof was almost level with\r\nthe ground. In front it was formed of board nailed to posts and covered\r\nwith tar as a preservative. Through crevices in the roof and side\r\nspread streaks and dots of light, a combination of which made the\r\nradiance that had attracted him. Oak stepped up behind, where, leaning\r\ndown upon the roof and putting his eye close to a hole, he could see\r\ninto the interior clearly.\r\n\r\nThe place contained two women and two cows. By the side of the latter a\r\nsteaming bran-mash stood in a bucket. One of the women was past middle\r\nage. Her companion was apparently young and graceful; he could form no\r\ndecided opinion upon her looks, her position being almost beneath his\r\neye, so that he saw her in a bird\u2019s-eye view, as Milton\u2019s Satan first\r\nsaw Paradise. She wore no bonnet or hat, but had enveloped herself in a\r\nlarge cloak, which was carelessly flung over her head as a covering.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere, now we\u2019ll go home,\u201D said the elder of the two, resting her\r\nknuckles upon her hips, and looking at their goings-on as a whole. \u201CI\r\ndo hope Daisy will fetch round again now. I have never been more\r\nfrightened in my life, but I don\u2019t mind breaking my rest if she\r\nrecovers.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe young woman, whose eyelids were apparently inclined to fall\r\ntogether on the smallest provocation of silence, yawned without parting\r\nher lips to any inconvenient extent, whereupon Gabriel caught the\r\ninfection and slightly yawned in sympathy.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish we were rich enough to pay a man to do these things,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CAs we are not, we must do them ourselves,\u201D said the other; \u201Cfor you\r\nmust help me if you stay.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, my hat is gone, however,\u201D continued the younger. \u201CIt went over\r\nthe hedge, I think. The idea of such a slight wind catching it.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe cow standing erect was of the Devon breed, and was encased in a\r\ntight warm hide of rich Indian red, as absolutely uniform from eyes to\r\ntail as if the animal had been dipped in a dye of that colour, her long\r\nback being mathematically level. The other was spotted, grey and white.\r\nBeside her Oak now noticed a little calf about a day old, looking\r\nidiotically at the two women, which showed that it had not long been\r\naccustomed to the phenomenon of eyesight, and often turning to the\r\nlantern, which it apparently mistook for the moon, inherited instinct\r\nhaving as yet had little time for correction by experience. Between the\r\nsheep and the cows Lucina had been busy on Norcombe Hill lately.\r\n\r\n\u201CI think we had better send for some oatmeal,\u201D said the elder woman;\r\n\u201Cthere\u2019s no more bran.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, aunt; and I\u2019ll ride over for it as soon as it is light.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut there\u2019s no side-saddle.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can ride on the other: trust me.\u201D\r\n\r\nOak, upon hearing these remarks, became more curious to observe her\r\nfeatures, but this prospect being denied him by the hooding effect of\r\nthe cloak, and by his a\u00EBrial position, he felt himself drawing upon his\r\nfancy for their details. In making even horizontal and clear\r\ninspections we colour and mould according to the wants within us\r\nwhatever our eyes bring in. Had Gabriel been able from the first to get\r\na distinct view of her countenance, his estimate of it as very handsome\r\nor slightly so would have been as his soul required a divinity at the\r\nmoment or was ready supplied with one. Having for some time known the\r\nwant of a satisfactory form to fill an increasing void within him, his\r\nposition moreover affording the widest scope for his fancy, he painted\r\nher a beauty.\r\n\r\nBy one of those whimsical coincidences in which Nature, like a busy\r\nmother, seems to spare a moment from her unremitting labours to turn\r\nand make her children smile, the girl now dropped the cloak, and forth\r\ntumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket. Oak knew her instantly\r\nas the heroine of the yellow waggon, myrtles, and looking-glass:\r\nprosily, as the woman who owed him twopence.\r\n\r\nThey placed the calf beside its mother again, took up the lantern, and\r\nwent out, the light sinking down the hill till it was no more than a\r\nnebula. Gabriel Oak returned to his flock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nA GIRL ON HORSEBACK\u2014CONVERSATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sluggish day began to break. Even its position terrestrially is one\r\nof the elements of a new interest, and for no particular reason save\r\nthat the incident of the night had occurred there Oak went again into\r\nthe plantation. Lingering and musing here, he heard the steps of a\r\nhorse at the foot of the hill, and soon there appeared in view an\r\nauburn pony with a girl on its back, ascending by the path leading past\r\nthe cattle-shed. She was the young woman of the night before. Gabriel\r\ninstantly thought of the hat she had mentioned as having lost in the\r\nwind; possibly she had come to look for it. He hastily scanned the\r\nditch and after walking about ten yards along it found the hat among\r\nthe leaves. Gabriel took it in his hand and returned to his hut. Here\r\nhe ensconced himself, and peeped through the loophole in the direction\r\nof the rider\u2019s approach.\r\n\r\nShe came up and looked around\u2014then on the other side of the hedge.\r\nGabriel was about to advance and restore the missing article when an\r\nunexpected performance induced him to suspend the action for the\r\npresent. The path, after passing the cowshed, bisected the plantation.\r\nIt was not a bridle-path\u2014merely a pedestrian\u2019s track, and the boughs\r\nspread horizontally at a height not greater than seven feet above the\r\nground, which made it impossible to ride erect beneath them. The girl,\r\nwho wore no riding-habit, looked around for a moment, as if to assure\r\nherself that all humanity was out of view, then dexterously dropped\r\nbackwards flat upon the pony\u2019s back, her head over its tail, her feet\r\nagainst its shoulders, and her eyes to the sky. The rapidity of her\r\nglide into this position was that of a kingfisher\u2014its noiselessness\r\nthat of a hawk. Gabriel\u2019s eyes had scarcely been able to follow her.\r\nThe tall lank pony seemed used to such doings, and ambled along\r\nunconcerned. Thus she passed under the level boughs.\r\n\r\nThe performer seemed quite at home anywhere between a horse\u2019s head and\r\nits tail, and the necessity for this abnormal attitude having ceased\r\nwith the passage of the plantation, she began to adopt another, even\r\nmore obviously convenient than the first. She had no side-saddle, and\r\nit was very apparent that a firm seat upon the smooth leather beneath\r\nher was unattainable sideways. Springing to her accustomed\r\nperpendicular like a bowed sapling, and satisfying herself that nobody\r\nwas in sight, she seated herself in the manner demanded by the saddle,\r\nthough hardly expected of the woman, and trotted off in the direction\r\nof Tewnell Mill.\r\n\r\nOak was amused, perhaps a little astonished, and hanging up the hat in\r\nhis hut, went again among his ewes. An hour passed, the girl returned,\r\nproperly seated now, with a bag of bran in front of her. On nearing the\r\ncattle-shed she was met by a boy bringing a milking-pail, who held the\r\nreins of the pony whilst she slid off. The boy led away the horse,\r\nleaving the pail with the young woman.\r\n\r\nSoon soft spirts alternating with loud spirts came in regular\r\nsuccession from within the shed, the obvious sounds of a person milking\r\na cow. Gabriel took the lost hat in his hand, and waited beside the\r\npath she would follow in leaving the hill.\r\n\r\nShe came, the pail in one hand, hanging against her knee. The left arm\r\nwas extended as a balance, enough of it being shown bare to make Oak\r\nwish that the event had happened in the summer, when the whole would\r\nhave been revealed. There was a bright air and manner about her now, by\r\nwhich she seemed to imply that the desirability of her existence could\r\nnot be questioned; and this rather saucy assumption failed in being\r\noffensive because a beholder felt it to be, upon the whole, true. Like\r\nexceptional emphasis in the tone of a genius, that which would have\r\nmade mediocrity ridiculous was an addition to recognised power. It was\r\nwith some surprise that she saw Gabriel\u2019s face rising like the moon\r\nbehind the hedge.\r\n\r\nThe adjustment of the farmer\u2019s hazy conceptions of her charms to the\r\nportrait of herself she now presented him with was less a diminution\r\nthan a difference. The starting-point selected by the judgment was her\r\nheight. She seemed tall, but the pail was a small one, and the hedge\r\ndiminutive; hence, making allowance for error by comparison with these,\r\nshe could have been not above the height to be chosen by women as best.\r\nAll features of consequence were severe and regular. It may have been\r\nobserved by persons who go about the shires with eyes for beauty, that\r\nin Englishwoman a classically-formed face is seldom found to be united\r\nwith a figure of the same pattern, the highly-finished features being\r\ngenerally too large for the remainder of the frame; that a graceful and\r\nproportionate figure of eight heads usually goes off into random facial\r\ncurves. Without throwing a Nymphean tissue over a milkmaid, let it be\r\nsaid that here criticism checked itself as out of place, and looked at\r\nher proportions with a long consciousness of pleasure. From the\r\ncontours of her figure in its upper part, she must have had a beautiful\r\nneck and shoulders; but since her infancy nobody had ever seen them.\r\nHad she been put into a low dress she would have run and thrust her\r\nhead into a bush. Yet she was not a shy girl by any means; it was\r\nmerely her instinct to draw the line dividing the seen from the unseen\r\nhigher than they do it in towns.\r\n\r\nThat the girl\u2019s thoughts hovered about her face and form as soon as she\r\ncaught Oak\u2019s eyes conning the same page was natural, and almost\r\ncertain. The self-consciousness shown would have been vanity if a\r\nlittle more pronounced, dignity if a little less. Rays of male vision\r\nseem to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces in rural districts;\r\nshe brushed hers with her hand, as if Gabriel had been irritating its\r\npink surface by actual touch, and the free air of her previous\r\nmovements was reduced at the same time to a chastened phase of itself.\r\nYet it was the man who blushed, the maid not at all.\r\n\r\n\u201CI found a hat,\u201D said Oak.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is mine,\u201D said she, and, from a sense of proportion, kept down to a\r\nsmall smile an inclination to laugh distinctly: \u201Cit flew away last\r\nnight.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COne o\u2019clock this morning?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell\u2014it was.\u201D She was surprised. \u201CHow did you know?\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CI was here.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are Farmer Oak, are you not?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat or thereabouts. I\u2019m lately come to this place.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA large farm?\u201D she inquired, casting her eyes round, and swinging back\r\nher hair, which was black in the shaded hollows of its mass; but it\r\nbeing now an hour past sunrise the rays touched its prominent curves\r\nwith a colour of their own.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; not large. About a hundred.\u201D (In speaking of farms the word\r\n\u201Cacres\u201D is omitted by the natives, by analogy to such old expressions\r\nas \u201Ca stag of ten.\u201D)\r\n\r\n\u201CI wanted my hat this morning,\u201D she went on. \u201CI had to ride to Tewnell\r\nMill.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes you had.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do you know?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI saw you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere?\u201D she inquired, a misgiving bringing every muscle of her\r\nlineaments and frame to a standstill.\r\n\r\n\u201CHere\u2014going through the plantation, and all down the hill,\u201D said Farmer\r\nOak, with an aspect excessively knowing with regard to some matter in\r\nhis mind, as he gazed at a remote point in the direction named, and\r\nthen turned back to meet his colloquist\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\nA perception caused him to withdraw his own eyes from hers as suddenly\r\nas if he had been caught in a theft. Recollection of the strange antics\r\nshe had indulged in when passing through the trees was succeeded in the\r\ngirl by a nettled palpitation, and that by a hot face. It was a time to\r\nsee a woman redden who was not given to reddening as a rule; not a\r\npoint in the milkmaid but was of the deepest rose-colour. From the\r\nMaiden\u2019s Blush, through all varieties of the Provence down to the\r\nCrimson Tuscany, the countenance of Oak\u2019s acquaintance quickly\r\ngraduated; whereupon he, in considerateness, turned away his head.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic man still looked the other way, and wondered when she\r\nwould recover coolness sufficient to justify him in facing her again.\r\nHe heard what seemed to be the flitting of a dead leaf upon the breeze,\r\nand looked. She had gone away.\r\n\r\nWith an air between that of Tragedy and Comedy Gabriel returned to his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nFive mornings and evenings passed. The young woman came regularly to\r\nmilk the healthy cow or to attend to the sick one, but never allowed\r\nher vision to stray in the direction of Oak\u2019s person. His want of tact\r\nhad deeply offended her\u2014not by seeing what he could not help, but by\r\nletting her know that he had seen it. For, as without law there is no\r\nsin, without eyes there is no indecorum; and she appeared to feel that\r\nGabriel\u2019s espial had made her an indecorous woman without her own\r\nconnivance. It was food for great regret with him; it was also a\r\n_contretemps_ which touched into life a latent heat he had experienced\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\nThe acquaintanceship might, however, have ended in a slow forgetting,\r\nbut for an incident which occurred at the end of the same week. One\r\nafternoon it began to freeze, and the frost increased with evening,\r\nwhich drew on like a stealthy tightening of bonds. It was a time when\r\nin cottages the breath of the sleepers freezes to the sheets; when\r\nround the drawing-room fire of a thick-walled mansion the sitters\u2019\r\nbacks are cold, even whilst their faces are all aglow. Many a small\r\nbird went to bed supperless that night among the bare boughs.\r\n\r\nAs the milking-hour drew near, Oak kept his usual watch upon the\r\ncowshed. At last he felt cold, and shaking an extra quantity of bedding\r\nround the yearling ewes he entered the hut and heaped more fuel upon\r\nthe stove. The wind came in at the bottom of the door, and to prevent\r\nit Oak laid a sack there and wheeled the cot round a little more to the\r\nsouth. Then the wind spouted in at a ventilating hole\u2014of which there\r\nwas one on each side of the hut.\r\n\r\nGabriel had always known that when the fire was lighted and the door\r\nclosed one of these must be kept open\u2014that chosen being always on the\r\nside away from the wind. Closing the slide to windward, he turned to\r\nopen the other; on second thoughts the farmer considered that he would\r\nfirst sit down leaving both closed for a minute or two, till the\r\ntemperature of the hut was a little raised. He sat down.\r\n\r\nHis head began to ache in an unwonted manner, and, fancying himself\r\nweary by reason of the broken rests of the preceding nights, Oak\r\ndecided to get up, open the slide, and then allow himself to fall\r\nasleep. He fell asleep, however, without having performed the necessary\r\npreliminary.\r\n\r\nHow long he remained unconscious Gabriel never knew. During the first\r\nstages of his return to perception peculiar deeds seemed to be in\r\ncourse of enactment. His dog was howling, his head was aching\r\nfearfully\u2014somebody was pulling him about, hands were loosening his\r\nneckerchief.\r\n\r\nOn opening his eyes he found that evening had sunk to dusk in a strange\r\nmanner of unexpectedness. The young girl with the remarkably pleasant\r\nlips and white teeth was beside him. More than this\u2014astonishingly\r\nmore\u2014his head was upon her lap, his face and neck were disagreeably\r\nwet, and her fingers were unbuttoning his collar.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhatever is the matter?\u201D said Oak, vacantly.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to experience mirth, but of too insignificant a kind to\r\nstart enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\u201CNothing now,\u201D she answered, \u201Csince you are not dead. It is a wonder\r\nyou were not suffocated in this hut of yours.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, the hut!\u201D murmured Gabriel. \u201CI gave ten pounds for that hut. But\r\nI\u2019ll sell it, and sit under thatched hurdles as they did in old times,\r\nand curl up to sleep in a lock of straw! It played me nearly the same\r\ntrick the other day!\u201D Gabriel, by way of emphasis, brought down his\r\nfist upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was not exactly the fault of the hut,\u201D she observed in a tone which\r\nshowed her to be that novelty among women\u2014one who finished a thought\r\nbefore beginning the sentence which was to convey it. \u201CYou should, I\r\nthink, have considered, and not have been so foolish as to leave the\r\nslides closed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes I suppose I should,\u201D said Oak, absently. He was endeavouring to\r\ncatch and appreciate the sensation of being thus with her, his head\r\nupon her dress, before the event passed on into the heap of bygone\r\nthings. He wished she knew his impressions; but he would as soon have\r\nthought of carrying an odour in a net as of attempting to convey the\r\nintangibilities of his feeling in the coarse meshes of language. So he\r\nremained silent.\r\n\r\nShe made him sit up, and then Oak began wiping his face and shaking\r\nhimself like a Samson. \u201CHow can I thank \u2019ee?\u201D he said at last,\r\ngratefully, some of the natural rusty red having returned to his face.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, never mind that,\u201D said the girl, smiling, and allowing her smile\r\nto hold good for Gabriel\u2019s next remark, whatever that might prove to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow did you find me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI heard your dog howling and scratching at the door of the hut when I\r\ncame to the milking (it was so lucky, Daisy\u2019s milking is almost over\r\nfor the season, and I shall not come here after this week or the next).\r\nThe dog saw me, and jumped over to me, and laid hold of my skirt. I\r\ncame across and looked round the hut the very first thing to see if the\r\nslides were closed. My uncle has a hut like this one, and I have heard\r\nhim tell his shepherd not to go to sleep without leaving a slide open.\r\nI opened the door, and there you were like dead. I threw the milk over\r\nyou, as there was no water, forgetting it was warm, and no use.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wonder if I should have died?\u201D Gabriel said, in a low voice, which\r\nwas rather meant to travel back to himself than to her.\r\n\r\n\u201COh no!\u201D the girl replied. She seemed to prefer a less tragic\r\nprobability; to have saved a man from death involved talk that should\r\nharmonise with the dignity of such a deed\u2014and she shunned it.\r\n\r\n\u201CI believe you saved my life, Miss\u2014I don\u2019t know your name. I know your\r\naunt\u2019s, but not yours.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI would just as soon not tell it\u2014rather not. There is no reason either\r\nwhy I should, as you probably will never have much to do with me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CStill, I should like to know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou can inquire at my aunt\u2019s\u2014she will tell you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy name is Gabriel Oak.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd mine isn\u2019t. You seem fond of yours in speaking it so decisively,\r\nGabriel Oak.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou see, it is the only one I shall ever have, and I must make the\r\nmost of it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI always think mine sounds odd and disagreeable.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI should think you might soon get a new one.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMercy!\u2014how many opinions you keep about you concerning other people,\r\nGabriel Oak.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, Miss\u2014excuse the words\u2014I thought you would like them. But I can\u2019t\r\nmatch you, I know, in mapping out my mind upon my tongue. I never was\r\nvery clever in my inside. But I thank you. Come, give me your hand.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, somewhat disconcerted at Oak\u2019s old-fashioned earnest\r\nconclusion to a dialogue lightly carried on. \u201CVery well,\u201D she said, and\r\ngave him her hand, compressing her lips to a demure impassivity. He\r\nheld it but an instant, and in his fear of being too demonstrative,\r\nswerved to the opposite extreme, touching her fingers with the\r\nlightness of a small-hearted person.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am sorry,\u201D he said the instant after.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat for?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLetting your hand go so quick.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou may have it again if you like; there it is.\u201D She gave him her hand\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nOak held it longer this time\u2014indeed, curiously long. \u201CHow soft it\r\nis\u2014being winter time, too\u2014not chapped or rough or anything!\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2014that\u2019s long enough,\u201D said she, though without pulling it away.\r\n\u201CBut I suppose you are thinking you would like to kiss it? You may if\r\nyou want to.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wasn\u2019t thinking of any such thing,\u201D said Gabriel, simply; \u201Cbut I\r\nwill\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat you won\u2019t!\u201D She snatched back her hand.\r\n\r\nGabriel felt himself guilty of another want of tact.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow find out my name,\u201D she said, teasingly; and withdrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nGABRIEL\u2019S RESOLVE\u2014THE VISIT\u2014THE MISTAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only superiority in women that is tolerable to the rival sex is, as\r\na rule, that of the unconscious kind; but a superiority which\r\nrecognizes itself may sometimes please by suggesting possibilities of\r\ncapture to the subordinated man.\r\n\r\nThis well-favoured and comely girl soon made appreciable inroads upon\r\nthe emotional constitution of young Farmer Oak.\r\n\r\nLove, being an extremely exacting usurer (a sense of exorbitant profit,\r\nspiritually, by an exchange of hearts, being at the bottom of pure\r\npassions, as that of exorbitant profit, bodily or materially, is at the\r\nbottom of those of lower atmosphere), every morning Oak\u2019s feelings were\r\nas sensitive as the money-market in calculations upon his chances. His\r\ndog waited for his meals in a way so like that in which Oak waited for\r\nthe girl\u2019s presence, that the farmer was quite struck with the\r\nresemblance, felt it lowering, and would not look at the dog. However,\r\nhe continued to watch through the hedge for her regular coming, and\r\nthus his sentiments towards her were deepened without any corresponding\r\neffect being produced upon herself. Oak had nothing finished and ready\r\nto say as yet, and not being able to frame love phrases which end where\r\nthey begin; passionate tales\u2014\r\n\r\n          \u2014Full of sound and fury,\r\n\u2014Signifying nothing\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nhe said no word at all.\r\n\r\nBy making inquiries he found that the girl\u2019s name was Bathsheba\r\nEverdene, and that the cow would go dry in about seven days. He dreaded\r\nthe eighth day.\r\n\r\nAt last the eighth day came. The cow had ceased to give milk for that\r\nyear, and Bathsheba Everdene came up the hill no more. Gabriel had\r\nreached a pitch of existence he never could have anticipated a short\r\ntime before. He liked saying \u201CBathsheba\u201D as a private enjoyment instead\r\nof whistling; turned over his taste to black hair, though he had sworn\r\nby brown ever since he was a boy, isolated himself till the space he\r\nfilled in the public eye was contemptibly small. Love is a possible\r\nstrength in an actual weakness. Marriage transforms a distraction into\r\na support, the power of which should be, and happily often is, in\r\ndirect proportion to the degree of imbecility it supplants. Oak began\r\nnow to see light in this direction, and said to himself, \u201CI\u2019ll make her\r\nmy wife, or upon my soul I shall be good for nothing!\u201D\r\n\r\nAll this while he was perplexing himself about an errand on which he\r\nmight consistently visit the cottage of Bathsheba\u2019s aunt.\r\n\r\nHe found his opportunity in the death of a ewe, mother of a living\r\nlamb. On a day which had a summer face and a winter constitution\u2014a fine\r\nJanuary morning, when there was just enough blue sky visible to make\r\ncheerfully-disposed people wish for more, and an occasional gleam of\r\nsilvery sunshine, Oak put the lamb into a respectable Sunday basket,\r\nand stalked across the fields to the house of Mrs. Hurst, the\r\naunt\u2014George, the dog walking behind, with a countenance of great\r\nconcern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be taking.\r\n\r\nGabriel had watched the blue wood-smoke curling from the chimney with\r\nstrange meditation. At evening he had fancifully traced it down the\r\nchimney to the spot of its origin\u2014seen the hearth and Bathsheba beside\r\nit\u2014beside it in her out-door dress; for the clothes she had worn on the\r\nhill were by association equally with her person included in the\r\ncompass of his affection; they seemed at this early time of his love a\r\nnecessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called Bathsheba Everdene.\r\n\r\nHe had made a toilet of a nicely-adjusted kind\u2014of a nature between the\r\ncarefully neat and the carelessly ornate\u2014of a degree between\r\nfine-market-day and wet-Sunday selection. He thoroughly cleaned his\r\nsilver watch-chain with whiting, put new lacing straps to his boots,\r\nlooked to the brass eyelet-holes, went to the inmost heart of the\r\nplantation for a new walking-stick, and trimmed it vigorously on his\r\nway back; took a new handkerchief from the bottom of his clothes-box,\r\nput on the light waistcoat patterned all over with sprigs of an elegant\r\nflower uniting the beauties of both rose and lily without the defects\r\nof either, and used all the hair-oil he possessed upon his usually dry,\r\nsandy, and inextricably curly hair, till he had deepened it to a\r\nsplendidly novel colour, between that of guano and Roman cement, making\r\nit stick to his head like mace round a nutmeg, or wet seaweed round a\r\nboulder after the ebb.\r\n\r\nNothing disturbed the stillness of the cottage save the chatter of a\r\nknot of sparrows on the eaves; one might fancy scandal and rumour to be\r\nno less the staple topic of these little coteries on roofs than of\r\nthose under them. It seemed that the omen was an unpropitious one, for,\r\nas the rather untoward commencement of Oak\u2019s overtures, just as he\r\narrived by the garden gate, he saw a cat inside, going into various\r\narched shapes and fiendish convulsions at the sight of his dog George.\r\nThe dog took no notice, for he had arrived at an age at which all\r\nsuperfluous barking was cynically avoided as a waste of breath\u2014in fact,\r\nhe never barked even at the sheep except to order, when it was done\r\nwith an absolutely neutral countenance, as a sort of\r\nCommination-service, which, though offensive, had to be gone through\r\nonce now and then to frighten the flock for their own good.\r\n\r\nA voice came from behind some laurel-bushes into which the cat had run:\r\n\r\n\u201CPoor dear! Did a nasty brute of a dog want to kill it;\u2014did he, poor\r\ndear!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI beg your pardon,\u201D said Oak to the voice, \u201Cbut George was walking on\r\nbehind me with a temper as mild as milk.\u201D\r\n\r\nAlmost before he had ceased speaking, Oak was seized with a misgiving\r\nas to whose ear was the recipient of his answer. Nobody appeared, and\r\nhe heard the person retreat among the bushes.\r\n\r\nGabriel meditated, and so deeply that he brought small furrows into his\r\nforehead by sheer force of reverie. Where the issue of an interview is\r\nas likely to be a vast change for the worse as for the better, any\r\ninitial difference from expectation causes nipping sensations of\r\nfailure. Oak went up to the door a little abashed: his mental rehearsal\r\nand the reality had had no common grounds of opening.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\u2019s aunt was indoors. \u201CWill you tell Miss Everdene that\r\nsomebody would be glad to speak to her?\u201D said Mr. Oak. (Calling one\u2019s\r\nself merely Somebody, without giving a name, is not to be taken as an\r\nexample of the ill-breeding of the rural world: it springs from a\r\nrefined modesty, of which townspeople, with their cards and\r\nannouncements, have no notion whatever.)\r\n\r\nBathsheba was out. The voice had evidently been hers.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you come in, Mr. Oak?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, thank \u2019ee,\u201D said Gabriel, following her to the fireplace. \u201CI\u2019ve\r\nbrought a lamb for Miss Everdene. I thought she might like one to rear;\r\ngirls do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe might,\u201D said Mrs. Hurst, musingly; \u201Cthough she\u2019s only a visitor\r\nhere. If you will wait a minute, Bathsheba will be in.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I will wait,\u201D said Gabriel, sitting down. \u201CThe lamb isn\u2019t really\r\nthe business I came about, Mrs. Hurst. In short, I was going to ask her\r\nif she\u2019d like to be married.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd were you indeed?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. Because if she would, I should be very glad to marry her. D\u2019ye\r\nknow if she\u2019s got any other young man hanging about her at all?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLet me think,\u201D said Mrs. Hurst, poking the fire superfluously....\r\n\u201CYes\u2014bless you, ever so many young men. You see, Farmer Oak, she\u2019s so\r\ngood-looking, and an excellent scholar besides\u2014she was going to be a\r\ngoverness once, you know, only she was too wild. Not that her young men\r\never come here\u2014but, Lord, in the nature of women, she must have a\r\ndozen!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s unfortunate,\u201D said Farmer Oak, contemplating a crack in the\r\nstone floor with sorrow. \u201CI\u2019m only an every-day sort of man, and my\r\nonly chance was in being the first comer.... Well, there\u2019s no use in my\r\nwaiting, for that was all I came about: so I\u2019ll take myself off\r\nhome-along, Mrs. Hurst.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen Gabriel had gone about two hundred yards along the down, he heard\r\na \u201Choi-hoi!\u201D uttered behind him, in a piping note of more treble\r\nquality than that in which the exclamation usually embodies itself when\r\nshouted across a field. He looked round, and saw a girl racing after\r\nhim, waving a white handkerchief.\r\n\r\nOak stood still\u2014and the runner drew nearer. It was Bathsheba Everdene.\r\nGabriel\u2019s colour deepened: hers was already deep, not, as it appeared,\r\nfrom emotion, but from running.\r\n\r\n\u201CFarmer Oak\u2014I\u2014\u201D she said, pausing for want of breath pulling up in\r\nfront of him with a slanted face and putting her hand to her side.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have just called to see you,\u201D said Gabriel, pending her further\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014I know that,\u201D she said panting like a robin, her face red and\r\nmoist from her exertions, like a peony petal before the sun dries off\r\nthe dew. \u201CI didn\u2019t know you had come to ask to have me, or I should\r\nhave come in from the garden instantly. I ran after you to say\u2014that my\r\naunt made a mistake in sending you away from courting me\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel expanded. \u201CI\u2019m sorry to have made you run so fast, my dear,\u201D he\r\nsaid, with a grateful sense of favours to come. \u201CWait a bit till you\u2019ve\r\nfound your breath.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014It was quite a mistake\u2014aunt\u2019s telling you I had a young man already,\u201D\r\nBathsheba went on. \u201CI haven\u2019t a sweetheart at all\u2014and I never had one,\r\nand I thought that, as times go with women, it was _such_ a pity to\r\nsend you away thinking that I had several.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CReally and truly I am glad to hear that!\u201D said Farmer Oak, smiling one\r\nof his long special smiles, and blushing with gladness. He held out his\r\nhand to take hers, which, when she had eased her side by pressing it\r\nthere, was prettily extended upon her bosom to still her loud-beating\r\nheart. Directly he seized it she put it behind her, so that it slipped\r\nthrough his fingers like an eel.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have a nice snug little farm,\u201D said Gabriel, with half a degree less\r\nassurance than when he had seized her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; you have.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA man has advanced me money to begin with, but still, it will soon be\r\npaid off, and though I am only an every-day sort of man, I have got on\r\na little since I was a boy.\u201D Gabriel uttered \u201Ca little\u201D in a tone to\r\nshow her that it was the complacent form of \u201Ca great deal.\u201D He\r\ncontinued: \u201CWhen we be married, I am quite sure I can work twice as\r\nhard as I do now.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe went forward and stretched out his arm again. Bathsheba had\r\novertaken him at a point beside which stood a low stunted holly bush,\r\nnow laden with red berries. Seeing his advance take the form of an\r\nattitude threatening a possible enclosure, if not compression, of her\r\nperson, she edged off round the bush.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, Farmer Oak,\u201D she said, over the top, looking at him with rounded\r\neyes, \u201CI never said I was going to marry you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell\u2014that _is_ a tale!\u201D said Oak, with dismay. \u201CTo run after anybody\r\nlike this, and then say you don\u2019t want him!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat I meant to tell you was only this,\u201D she said eagerly, and yet\r\nhalf conscious of the absurdity of the position she had made for\r\nherself\u2014\u201Cthat nobody has got me yet as a sweetheart, instead of my\r\nhaving a dozen, as my aunt said; I _hate_ to be thought men\u2019s property\r\nin that way, though possibly I shall be had some day. Why, if I\u2019d\r\nwanted you I shouldn\u2019t have run after you like this; \u2019twould have been\r\nthe _forwardest_ thing! But there was no harm in hurrying to correct a\r\npiece of false news that had been told you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, no\u2014no harm at all.\u201D But there is such a thing as being too\r\ngenerous in expressing a judgment impulsively, and Oak added with a\r\nmore appreciative sense of all the circumstances\u2014\u201CWell, I am not quite\r\ncertain it was no harm.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed, I hadn\u2019t time to think before starting whether I wanted to\r\nmarry or not, for you\u2019d have been gone over the hill.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCome,\u201D said Gabriel, freshening again; \u201Cthink a minute or two. I\u2019ll\r\nwait a while, Miss Everdene. Will you marry me? Do, Bathsheba. I love\r\nyou far more than common!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll try to think,\u201D she observed, rather more timorously; \u201Cif I can\r\nthink out of doors; my mind spreads away so.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you can give a guess.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen give me time.\u201D Bathsheba looked thoughtfully into the distance,\r\naway from the direction in which Gabriel stood.\r\n\r\n\u201CI can make you happy,\u201D said he to the back of her head, across the\r\nbush. \u201CYou shall have a piano in a year or two\u2014farmers\u2019 wives are\r\ngetting to have pianos now\u2014and I\u2019ll practise up the flute right well to\r\nplay with you in the evenings.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; I should like that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd have one of those little ten-pound gigs for market\u2014and nice\r\nflowers, and birds\u2014cocks and hens I mean, because they be useful,\u201D\r\ncontinued Gabriel, feeling balanced between poetry and practicality.\r\n\r\n\u201CI should like it very much.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd a frame for cucumbers\u2014like a gentleman and lady.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd when the wedding was over, we\u2019d have it put in the newspaper list\r\nof marriages.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDearly I should like that!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd the babies in the births\u2014every man jack of \u2019em! And at home by the\r\nfire, whenever you look up, there I shall be\u2014and whenever I look up\r\nthere will be you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWait, wait, and don\u2019t be improper!\u201D\r\n\r\nHer countenance fell, and she was silent awhile. He regarded the red\r\nberries between them over and over again, to such an extent, that holly\r\nseemed in his after life to be a cypher signifying a proposal of\r\nmarriage. Bathsheba decisively turned to him.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; \u2019tis no use,\u201D she said. \u201CI don\u2019t want to marry you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTry.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have tried hard all the time I\u2019ve been thinking; for a marriage\r\nwould be very nice in one sense. People would talk about me, and think\r\nI had won my battle, and I should feel triumphant, and all that. But a\r\nhusband\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, he\u2019d always be there, as you say; whenever I looked up, there\r\nhe\u2019d be.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf course he would\u2014I, that is.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, what I mean is that I shouldn\u2019t mind being a bride at a wedding,\r\nif I could be one without having a husband. But since a woman can\u2019t\r\nshow off in that way by herself, I shan\u2019t marry\u2014at least yet.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a terrible wooden story!\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this criticism of her statement Bathsheba made an addition to her\r\ndignity by a slight sweep away from him.\r\n\r\n\u201CUpon my heart and soul, I don\u2019t know what a maid can say stupider than\r\nthat,\u201D said Oak. \u201CBut dearest,\u201D he continued in a palliative voice,\r\n\u201Cdon\u2019t be like it!\u201D Oak sighed a deep honest sigh\u2014none the less so in\r\nthat, being like the sigh of a pine plantation, it was rather\r\nnoticeable as a disturbance of the atmosphere. \u201CWhy won\u2019t you have me?\u201D\r\nhe appealed, creeping round the holly to reach her side.\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot,\u201D she said, retreating.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut why?\u201D he persisted, standing still at last in despair of ever\r\nreaching her, and facing over the bush.\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause I don\u2019t love you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, but\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nShe contracted a yawn to an inoffensive smallness, so that it was\r\nhardly ill-mannered at all. \u201CI don\u2019t love you,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I love you\u2014and, as for myself, I am content to be liked.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh Mr. Oak\u2014that\u2019s very fine! You\u2019d get to despise me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever,\u201D said Mr Oak, so earnestly that he seemed to be coming, by the\r\nforce of his words, straight through the bush and into her arms. \u201CI\r\nshall do one thing in this life\u2014one thing certain\u2014that is, love you,\r\nand long for you, and _keep wanting you_ till I die.\u201D His voice had a\r\ngenuine pathos now, and his large brown hands perceptibly trembled.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt seems dreadfully wrong not to have you when you feel so much!\u201D she\r\nsaid with a little distress, and looking hopelessly around for some\r\nmeans of escape from her moral dilemma. \u201CHow I wish I hadn\u2019t run after\r\nyou!\u201D However she seemed to have a short cut for getting back to\r\ncheerfulness, and set her face to signify archness. \u201CIt wouldn\u2019t do,\r\nMr. Oak. I want somebody to tame me; I am too independent; and you\r\nwould never be able to, I know.\u201D\r\n\r\nOak cast his eyes down the field in a way implying that it was useless\r\nto attempt argument.\r\n\r\n\u201CMr. Oak,\u201D she said, with luminous distinctness and common sense, \u201Cyou\r\nare better off than I. I have hardly a penny in the world\u2014I am staying\r\nwith my aunt for my bare sustenance. I am better educated than you\u2014and\r\nI don\u2019t love you a bit: that\u2019s my side of the case. Now yours: you are\r\na farmer just beginning; and you ought in common prudence, if you marry\r\nat all (which you should certainly not think of doing at present), to\r\nmarry a woman with money, who would stock a larger farm for you than\r\nyou have now.\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel looked at her with a little surprise and much admiration.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s the very thing I had been thinking myself!\u201D he na\u00EFvely said.\r\n\r\nFarmer Oak had one-and-a-half Christian characteristics too many to\r\nsucceed with Bathsheba: his humility, and a superfluous moiety of\r\nhonesty. Bathsheba was decidedly disconcerted.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, then, why did you come and disturb me?\u201D she said, almost\r\nangrily, if not quite, an enlarging red spot rising in each cheek.\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t do what I think would be\u2014would be\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CRight?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo: wise.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou have made an admission _now_, Mr. Oak,\u201D she exclaimed, with even\r\nmore hauteur, and rocking her head disdainfully. \u201CAfter that, do you\r\nthink I could marry you? Not if I know it.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe broke in passionately. \u201CBut don\u2019t mistake me like that! Because I am\r\nopen enough to own what every man in my shoes would have thought of,\r\nyou make your colours come up your face, and get crabbed with me. That\r\nabout your not being good enough for me is nonsense. You speak like a\r\nlady\u2014all the parish notice it, and your uncle at Weatherbury is, I have\r\nheerd, a large farmer\u2014much larger than ever I shall be. May I call in\r\nthe evening, or will you walk along with me o\u2019 Sundays? I don\u2019t want\r\nyou to make-up your mind at once, if you\u2019d rather not.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo\u2014no\u2014I cannot. Don\u2019t press me any more\u2014don\u2019t. I don\u2019t love you\u2014so\r\n\u2019twould be ridiculous,\u201D she said, with a laugh.\r\n\r\nNo man likes to see his emotions the sport of a merry-go-round of\r\nskittishness. \u201CVery well,\u201D said Oak, firmly, with the bearing of one\r\nwho was going to give his days and nights to Ecclesiastes for ever.\r\n\u201CThen I\u2019ll ask you no more.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nDEPARTURE OF BATHSHEBA\u2014A PASTORAL TRAGEDY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news which one day reached Gabriel, that Bathsheba Everdene had\r\nleft the neighbourhood, had an influence upon him which might have\r\nsurprised any who never suspected that the more emphatic the\r\nrenunciation the less absolute its character.\r\n\r\nIt may have been observed that there is no regular path for getting out\r\nof love as there is for getting in. Some people look upon marriage as a\r\nshort cut that way, but it has been known to fail. Separation, which\r\nwas the means that chance offered to Gabriel Oak by Bathsheba\u2019s\r\ndisappearance, though effectual with people of certain humours, is apt\r\nto idealize the removed object with others\u2014notably those whose\r\naffection, placid and regular as it may be, flows deep and long. Oak\r\nbelonged to the even-tempered order of humanity, and felt the secret\r\nfusion of himself in Bathsheba to be burning with a finer flame now\r\nthat she was gone\u2014that was all.\r\n\r\nHis incipient friendship with her aunt had been nipped by the failure\r\nof his suit, and all that Oak learnt of Bathsheba\u2019s movements was done\r\nindirectly. It appeared that she had gone to a place called\r\nWeatherbury, more than twenty miles off, but in what capacity\u2014whether\r\nas a visitor, or permanently, he could not discover.\r\n\r\nGabriel had two dogs. George, the elder, exhibited an ebony-tipped\r\nnose, surrounded by a narrow margin of pink flesh, and a coat marked in\r\nrandom splotches approximating in colour to white and slaty grey; but\r\nthe grey, after years of sun and rain, had been scorched and washed out\r\nof the more prominent locks, leaving them of a reddish-brown, as if the\r\nblue component of the grey had faded, like the indigo from the same\r\nkind of colour in Turner\u2019s pictures. In substance it had originally\r\nbeen hair, but long contact with sheep seemed to be turning it by\r\ndegrees into wool of a poor quality and staple.\r\n\r\nThis dog had originally belonged to a shepherd of inferior morals and\r\ndreadful temper, and the result was that George knew the exact degrees\r\nof condemnation signified by cursing and swearing of all descriptions\r\nbetter than the wickedest old man in the neighbourhood. Long experience\r\nhad so precisely taught the animal the difference between such\r\nexclamations as \u201CCome in!\u201D and \u201CD\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 ye, come in!\u201D that he knew to a\r\nhair\u2019s breadth the rate of trotting back from the ewes\u2019 tails that each\r\ncall involved, if a staggerer with the sheep crook was to be escaped.\r\nThough old, he was clever and trustworthy still.\r\n\r\nThe young dog, George\u2019s son, might possibly have been the image of his\r\nmother, for there was not much resemblance between him and George. He\r\nwas learning the sheep-keeping business, so as to follow on at the\r\nflock when the other should die, but had got no further than the\r\nrudiments as yet\u2014still finding an insuperable difficulty in\r\ndistinguishing between doing a thing well enough and doing it too well.\r\nSo earnest and yet so wrong-headed was this young dog (he had no name\r\nin particular, and answered with perfect readiness to any pleasant\r\ninterjection), that if sent behind the flock to help them on, he did it\r\nso thoroughly that he would have chased them across the whole county\r\nwith the greatest pleasure if not called off or reminded when to stop\r\nby the example of old George.\r\n\r\nThus much for the dogs. On the further side of Norcombe Hill was a\r\nchalk-pit, from which chalk had been drawn for generations, and spread\r\nover adjacent farms. Two hedges converged upon it in the form of a V,\r\nbut without quite meeting. The narrow opening left, which was\r\nimmediately over the brow of the pit, was protected by a rough railing.\r\n\r\nOne night, when Farmer Oak had returned to his house, believing there\r\nwould be no further necessity for his attendance on the down, he called\r\nas usual to the dogs, previously to shutting them up in the outhouse\r\ntill next morning. Only one responded\u2014old George; the other could not\r\nbe found, either in the house, lane, or garden. Gabriel then remembered\r\nthat he had left the two dogs on the hill eating a dead lamb (a kind of\r\nmeat he usually kept from them, except when other food ran short), and\r\nconcluding that the young one had not finished his meal, he went\r\nindoors to the luxury of a bed, which latterly he had only enjoyed on\r\nSundays.\r\n\r\nIt was a still, moist night. Just before dawn he was assisted in waking\r\nby the abnormal reverberation of familiar music. To the shepherd, the\r\nnote of the sheep-bell, like the ticking of the clock to other people,\r\nis a chronic sound that only makes itself noticed by ceasing or\r\naltering in some unusual manner from the well-known idle twinkle which\r\nsignifies to the accustomed ear, however distant, that all is well in\r\nthe fold. In the solemn calm of the awakening morn that note was heard\r\nby Gabriel, beating with unusual violence and rapidity. This\r\nexceptional ringing may be caused in two ways\u2014by the rapid feeding of\r\nthe sheep bearing the bell, as when the flock breaks into new pasture,\r\nwhich gives it an intermittent rapidity, or by the sheep starting off\r\nin a run, when the sound has a regular palpitation. The experienced ear\r\nof Oak knew the sound he now heard to be caused by the running of the\r\nflock with great velocity.\r\n\r\nHe jumped out of bed, dressed, tore down the lane through a foggy dawn,\r\nand ascended the hill. The forward ewes were kept apart from those\r\namong which the fall of lambs would be later, there being two hundred\r\nof the latter class in Gabriel\u2019s flock. These two hundred seemed to\r\nhave absolutely vanished from the hill. There were the fifty with their\r\nlambs, enclosed at the other end as he had left them, but the rest,\r\nforming the bulk of the flock, were nowhere. Gabriel called at the top\r\nof his voice the shepherd\u2019s call:\r\n\r\n\u201COvey, ovey, ovey!\u201D\r\n\r\nNot a single bleat. He went to the hedge; a gap had been broken through\r\nit, and in the gap were the footprints of the sheep. Rather surprised\r\nto find them break fence at this season, yet putting it down instantly\r\nto their great fondness for ivy in winter-time, of which a great deal\r\ngrew in the plantation, he followed through the hedge. They were not in\r\nthe plantation. He called again: the valleys and farthest hills\r\nresounded as when the sailors invoked the lost Hylas on the Mysian\r\nshore; but no sheep. He passed through the trees and along the ridge of\r\nthe hill. On the extreme summit, where the ends of the two converging\r\nhedges of which we have spoken were stopped short by meeting the brow\r\nof the chalk-pit, he saw the younger dog standing against the sky\u2014dark\r\nand motionless as Napoleon at St. Helena.\r\n\r\nA horrible conviction darted through Oak. With a sensation of bodily\r\nfaintness he advanced: at one point the rails were broken through, and\r\nthere he saw the footprints of his ewes. The dog came up, licked his\r\nhand, and made signs implying that he expected some great reward for\r\nsignal services rendered. Oak looked over the precipice. The ewes lay\r\ndead and dying at its foot\u2014a heap of two hundred mangled carcasses,\r\nrepresenting in their condition just now at least two hundred more.\r\n\r\nOak was an intensely humane man: indeed, his humanity often tore in\r\npieces any politic intentions of his which bordered on strategy, and\r\ncarried him on as by gravitation. A shadow in his life had always been\r\nthat his flock ended in mutton\u2014that a day came and found every shepherd\r\nan arrant traitor to his defenseless sheep. His first feeling now was\r\none of pity for the untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their unborn\r\nlambs.\r\n\r\nIt was a second to remember another phase of the matter. The sheep were\r\nnot insured. All the savings of a frugal life had been dispersed at a\r\nblow; his hopes of being an independent farmer were laid low\u2014possibly\r\nfor ever. Gabriel\u2019s energies, patience, and industry had been so\r\nseverely taxed during the years of his life between eighteen and\r\neight-and-twenty, to reach his present stage of progress that no more\r\nseemed to be left in him. He leant down upon a rail, and covered his\r\nface with his hands.\r\n\r\nStupors, however, do not last for ever, and Farmer Oak recovered from\r\nhis. It was as remarkable as it was characteristic that the one\r\nsentence he uttered was in thankfulness:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CThank God I am not married: what would _she_ have done in the poverty\r\nnow coming upon me!\u201D\r\n\r\nOak raised his head, and wondering what he could do, listlessly\r\nsurveyed the scene. By the outer margin of the Pit was an oval pond,\r\nand over it hung the attenuated skeleton of a chrome-yellow moon which\r\nhad only a few days to last\u2014the morning star dogging her on the left\r\nhand. The pool glittered like a dead man\u2019s eye, and as the world awoke\r\na breeze blew, shaking and elongating the reflection of the moon\r\nwithout breaking it, and turning the image of the star to a phosphoric\r\nstreak upon the water. All this Oak saw and remembered.\r\n\r\nAs far as could be learnt it appeared that the poor young dog, still\r\nunder the impression that since he was kept for running after sheep,\r\nthe more he ran after them the better, had at the end of his meal off\r\nthe dead lamb, which may have given him additional energy and spirits,\r\ncollected all the ewes into a corner, driven the timid creatures\r\nthrough the hedge, across the upper field, and by main force of\r\nworrying had given them momentum enough to break down a portion of the\r\nrotten railing, and so hurled them over the edge.\r\n\r\nGeorge\u2019s son had done his work so thoroughly that he was considered too\r\ngood a workman to live, and was, in fact, taken and tragically shot at\r\ntwelve o\u2019clock that same day\u2014another instance of the untoward fate\r\nwhich so often attends dogs and other philosophers who follow out a\r\ntrain of reasoning to its logical conclusion, and attempt perfectly\r\nconsistent conduct in a world made up so largely of compromise.\r\n\r\nGabriel\u2019s farm had been stocked by a dealer\u2014on the strength of Oak\u2019s\r\npromising look and character\u2014who was receiving a percentage from the\r\nfarmer till such time as the advance should be cleared off. Oak found\r\nthat the value of stock, plant, and implements which were really his\r\nown would be about sufficient to pay his debts, leaving himself a free\r\nman with the clothes he stood up in, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nTHE FAIR\u2014THE JOURNEY\u2014THE FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo months passed away. We are brought on to a day in February, on\r\nwhich was held the yearly statute or hiring fair in the county-town of\r\nCasterbridge.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the street stood from two to three hundred blithe and\r\nhearty labourers waiting upon Chance\u2014all men of the stamp to whom\r\nlabour suggests nothing worse than a wrestle with gravitation, and\r\npleasure nothing better than a renunciation of the same. Among these,\r\ncarters and waggoners were distinguished by having a piece of whip-cord\r\ntwisted round their hats; thatchers wore a fragment of woven straw;\r\nshepherds held their sheep-crooks in their hands; and thus the\r\nsituation required was known to the hirers at a glance.\r\n\r\nIn the crowd was an athletic young fellow of somewhat superior\r\nappearance to the rest\u2014in fact, his superiority was marked enough to\r\nlead several ruddy peasants standing by to speak to him inquiringly, as\r\nto a farmer, and to use \u201CSir\u201D as a finishing word. His answer always\r\nwas,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CI am looking for a place myself\u2014a bailiff\u2019s. Do ye know of anybody who\r\nwants one?\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel was paler now. His eyes were more meditative, and his\r\nexpression was more sad. He had passed through an ordeal of\r\nwretchedness which had given him more than it had taken away. He had\r\nsunk from his modest elevation as pastoral king into the very\r\nslime-pits of Siddim; but there was left to him a dignified calm he had\r\nnever before known, and that indifference to fate which, though it\r\noften makes a villain of a man, is the basis of his sublimity when it\r\ndoes not. And thus the abasement had been exaltation, and the loss\r\ngain.\r\n\r\nIn the morning a regiment of cavalry had left the town, and a sergeant\r\nand his party had been beating up for recruits through the four\r\nstreets. As the end of the day drew on, and he found himself not hired,\r\nGabriel almost wished that he had joined them, and gone off to serve\r\nhis country. Weary of standing in the market-place, and not much\r\nminding the kind of work he turned his hand to, he decided to offer\r\nhimself in some other capacity than that of bailiff.\r\n\r\nAll the farmers seemed to be wanting shepherds. Sheep-tending was\r\nGabriel\u2019s speciality. Turning down an obscure street and entering an\r\nobscurer lane, he went up to a smith\u2019s shop.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow long would it take you to make a shepherd\u2019s crook?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTwenty minutes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow much?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTwo shillings.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe sat on a bench and the crook was made, a stem being given him into\r\nthe bargain.\r\n\r\nHe then went to a ready-made clothes\u2019 shop, the owner of which had a\r\nlarge rural connection. As the crook had absorbed most of Gabriel\u2019s\r\nmoney, he attempted, and carried out, an exchange of his overcoat for a\r\nshepherd\u2019s regulation smock-frock.\r\n\r\nThis transaction having been completed, he again hurried off to the\r\ncentre of the town, and stood on the kerb of the pavement, as a\r\nshepherd, crook in hand.\r\n\r\nNow that Oak had turned himself into a shepherd, it seemed that\r\nbailiffs were most in demand. However, two or three farmers noticed him\r\nand drew near. Dialogues followed, more or less in the subjoined form:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere do you come from?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNorcombe.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a long way.\r\n\r\n\u201CFifteen miles.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho\u2019s farm were you upon last?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy own.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis reply invariably operated like a rumour of cholera. The inquiring\r\nfarmer would edge away and shake his head dubiously. Gabriel, like his\r\ndog, was too good to be trustworthy, and he never made advance beyond\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\nIt is safer to accept any chance that offers itself, and extemporize a\r\nprocedure to fit it, than to get a good plan matured, and wait for a\r\nchance of using it. Gabriel wished he had not nailed up his colours as\r\na shepherd, but had laid himself out for anything in the whole cycle of\r\nlabour that was required in the fair. It grew dusk. Some merry men were\r\nwhistling and singing by the corn-exchange. Gabriel\u2019s hand, which had\r\nlain for some time idle in his smock-frock pocket, touched his flute\r\nwhich he carried there. Here was an opportunity for putting his dearly\r\nbought wisdom into practice.\r\n\r\nHe drew out his flute and began to play \u201CJockey to the Fair\u201D in the\r\nstyle of a man who had never known a moment\u2019s sorrow. Oak could pipe\r\nwith Arcadian sweetness, and the sound of the well-known notes cheered\r\nhis own heart as well as those of the loungers. He played on with\r\nspirit, and in half an hour had earned in pence what was a small\r\nfortune to a destitute man.\r\n\r\nBy making inquiries he learnt that there was another fair at Shottsford\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow far is Shottsford?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTen miles t\u2019other side of Weatherbury.\u201D\r\n\r\nWeatherbury! It was where Bathsheba had gone two months before. This\r\ninformation was like coming from night into noon.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow far is it to Weatherbury?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFive or six miles.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba had probably left Weatherbury long before this time, but the\r\nplace had enough interest attaching to it to lead Oak to choose\r\nShottsford fair as his next field of inquiry, because it lay in the\r\nWeatherbury quarter. Moreover, the Weatherbury folk were by no means\r\nuninteresting intrinsically. If report spoke truly they were as hardy,\r\nmerry, thriving, wicked a set as any in the whole county. Oak resolved\r\nto sleep at Weatherbury that night on his way to Shottsford, and struck\r\nout at once into the high road which had been recommended as the direct\r\nroute to the village in question.\r\n\r\nThe road stretched through water-meadows traversed by little brooks,\r\nwhose quivering surfaces were braided along their centres, and folded\r\ninto creases at the sides; or, where the flow was more rapid, the\r\nstream was pied with spots of white froth, which rode on in undisturbed\r\nserenity. On the higher levels the dead and dry carcasses of leaves\r\ntapped the ground as they bowled along helter-skelter upon the\r\nshoulders of the wind, and little birds in the hedges were rustling\r\ntheir feathers and tucking themselves in comfortably for the night,\r\nretaining their places if Oak kept moving, but flying away if he\r\nstopped to look at them. He passed by Yalbury Wood where the game-birds\r\nwere rising to their roosts, and heard the crack-voiced cock-pheasants\r\n\u201Ccu-uck, cuck,\u201D and the wheezy whistle of the hens.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had walked three or four miles every shape in the\r\nlandscape had assumed a uniform hue of blackness. He descended Yalbury\r\nHill and could just discern ahead of him a waggon, drawn up under a\r\ngreat over-hanging tree by the roadside.\r\n\r\nOn coming close, he found there were no horses attached to it, the spot\r\nbeing apparently quite deserted. The waggon, from its position, seemed\r\nto have been left there for the night, for beyond about half a truss of\r\nhay which was heaped in the bottom, it was quite empty. Gabriel sat\r\ndown on the shafts of the vehicle and considered his position. He\r\ncalculated that he had walked a very fair proportion of the journey;\r\nand having been on foot since daybreak, he felt tempted to lie down\r\nupon the hay in the waggon instead of pushing on to the village of\r\nWeatherbury, and having to pay for a lodging.\r\n\r\nEating his last slices of bread and ham, and drinking from the bottle\r\nof cider he had taken the precaution to bring with him, he got into the\r\nlonely waggon. Here he spread half of the hay as a bed, and, as well as\r\nhe could in the darkness, pulled the other half over him by way of\r\nbed-clothes, covering himself entirely, and feeling, physically, as\r\ncomfortable as ever he had been in his life. Inward melancholy it was\r\nimpossible for a man like Oak, introspective far beyond his neighbours,\r\nto banish quite, whilst conning the present untoward page of his\r\nhistory. So, thinking of his misfortunes, amorous and pastoral, he fell\r\nasleep, shepherds enjoying, in common with sailors, the privilege of\r\nbeing able to summon the god instead of having to wait for him.\r\n\r\nOn somewhat suddenly awaking, after a sleep of whose length he had no\r\nidea, Oak found that the waggon was in motion. He was being carried\r\nalong the road at a rate rather considerable for a vehicle without\r\nsprings, and under circumstances of physical uneasiness, his head being\r\ndandled up and down on the bed of the waggon like a kettledrum-stick.\r\nHe then distinguished voices in conversation, coming from the forpart\r\nof the waggon. His concern at this dilemma (which would have been\r\nalarm, had he been a thriving man; but misfortune is a fine opiate to\r\npersonal terror) led him to peer cautiously from the hay, and the first\r\nsight he beheld was the stars above him. Charles\u2019s Wain was getting\r\ntowards a right angle with the Pole star, and Gabriel concluded that it\r\nmust be about nine o\u2019clock\u2014in other words, that he had slept two hours.\r\nThis small astronomical calculation was made without any positive\r\neffort, and whilst he was stealthily turning to discover, if possible,\r\ninto whose hands he had fallen.\r\n\r\nTwo figures were dimly visible in front, sitting with their legs\r\noutside the waggon, one of whom was driving. Gabriel soon found that\r\nthis was the waggoner, and it appeared they had come from Casterbridge\r\nfair, like himself.\r\n\r\nA conversation was in progress, which continued thus:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CBe as \u2019twill, she\u2019s a fine handsome body as far\u2019s looks be concerned.\r\nBut that\u2019s only the skin of the woman, and these dandy cattle be as\r\nproud as a lucifer in their insides.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy\u2014so \u2019a do seem, Billy Smallbury\u2014so \u2019a do seem.\u201D This utterance was\r\nvery shaky by nature, and more so by circumstance, the jolting of the\r\nwaggon not being without its effect upon the speaker\u2019s larynx. It came\r\nfrom the man who held the reins.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s a very vain feymell\u2014so \u2019tis said here and there.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, now. If so be \u2019tis like that, I can\u2019t look her in the face. Lord,\r\nno: not I\u2014heh-heh-heh! Such a shy man as I be!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014she\u2019s very vain. \u2019Tis said that every night at going to bed she\r\nlooks in the glass to put on her night-cap properly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd not a married woman. Oh, the world!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd \u2019a can play the peanner, so \u2019tis said. Can play so clever that \u2019a\r\ncan make a psalm tune sound as well as the merriest loose song a man\r\ncan wish for.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CD\u2019ye tell o\u2019t! A happy time for us, and I feel quite a new man! And\r\nhow do she pay?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat I don\u2019t know, Master Poorgrass.\u201D\r\n\r\nOn hearing these and other similar remarks, a wild thought flashed into\r\nGabriel\u2019s mind that they might be speaking of Bathsheba. There were,\r\nhowever, no grounds for retaining such a supposition, for the waggon,\r\nthough going in the direction of Weatherbury, might be going beyond it,\r\nand the woman alluded to seemed to be the mistress of some estate. They\r\nwere now apparently close upon Weatherbury and not to alarm the\r\nspeakers unnecessarily, Gabriel slipped out of the waggon unseen.\r\n\r\nHe turned to an opening in the hedge, which he found to be a gate, and\r\nmounting thereon, he sat meditating whether to seek a cheap lodging in\r\nthe village, or to ensure a cheaper one by lying under some hay or\r\ncorn-stack. The crunching jangle of the waggon died upon his ear. He\r\nwas about to walk on, when he noticed on his left hand an unusual\r\nlight\u2014appearing about half a mile distant. Oak watched it, and the glow\r\nincreased. Something was on fire.\r\n\r\nGabriel again mounted the gate, and, leaping down on the other side\r\nupon what he found to be ploughed soil, made across the field in the\r\nexact direction of the fire. The blaze, enlarging in a double ratio by\r\nhis approach and its own increase, showed him as he drew nearer the\r\noutlines of ricks beside it, lighted up to great distinctness. A\r\nrick-yard was the source of the fire. His weary face now began to be\r\npainted over with a rich orange glow, and the whole front of his\r\nsmock-frock and gaiters was covered with a dancing shadow pattern of\r\nthorn-twigs\u2014the light reaching him through a leafless intervening\r\nhedge\u2014and the metallic curve of his sheep-crook shone silver-bright in\r\nthe same abounding rays. He came up to the boundary fence, and stood to\r\nregain breath. It seemed as if the spot was unoccupied by a living\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nThe fire was issuing from a long straw-stack, which was so far gone as\r\nto preclude a possibility of saving it. A rick burns differently from a\r\nhouse. As the wind blows the fire inwards, the portion in flames\r\ncompletely disappears like melting sugar, and the outline is lost to\r\nthe eye. However, a hay or a wheat-rick, well put together, will resist\r\ncombustion for a length of time, if it begins on the outside.\r\n\r\nThis before Gabriel\u2019s eyes was a rick of straw, loosely put together,\r\nand the flames darted into it with lightning swiftness. It glowed on\r\nthe windward side, rising and falling in intensity, like the coal of a\r\ncigar. Then a superincumbent bundle rolled down, with a whisking noise;\r\nflames elongated, and bent themselves about with a quiet roar, but no\r\ncrackle. Banks of smoke went off horizontally at the back like passing\r\nclouds, and behind these burned hidden pyres, illuminating the\r\nsemi-transparent sheet of smoke to a lustrous yellow uniformity.\r\nIndividual straws in the foreground were consumed in a creeping\r\nmovement of ruddy heat, as if they were knots of red worms, and above\r\nshone imaginary fiery faces, tongues hanging from lips, glaring eyes,\r\nand other impish forms, from which at intervals sparks flew in clusters\r\nlike birds from a nest.\r\n\r\nOak suddenly ceased from being a mere spectator by discovering the case\r\nto be more serious than he had at first imagined. A scroll of smoke\r\nblew aside and revealed to him a wheat-rick in startling juxtaposition\r\nwith the decaying one, and behind this a series of others, composing\r\nthe main corn produce of the farm; so that instead of the straw-stack\r\nstanding, as he had imagined comparatively isolated, there was a\r\nregular connection between it and the remaining stacks of the group.\r\n\r\nGabriel leapt over the hedge, and saw that he was not alone. The first\r\nman he came to was running about in a great hurry, as if his thoughts\r\nwere several yards in advance of his body, which they could never drag\r\non fast enough.\r\n\r\n\u201CO, man\u2014fire, fire! A good master and a bad servant is fire, fire!\u2014I\r\nmane a bad servant and a good master. Oh, Mark Clark\u2014come! And you,\r\nBilly Smallbury\u2014and you, Maryann Money\u2014and you, Jan Coggan, and Matthew\r\nthere!\u201D Other figures now appeared behind this shouting man and among\r\nthe smoke, and Gabriel found that, far from being alone he was in a\r\ngreat company\u2014whose shadows danced merrily up and down, timed by the\r\njigging of the flames, and not at all by their owners\u2019 movements. The\r\nassemblage\u2014belonging to that class of society which casts its thoughts\r\ninto the form of feeling, and its feelings into the form of\r\ncommotion\u2014set to work with a remarkable confusion of purpose.\r\n\r\n\u201CStop the draught under the wheat-rick!\u201D cried Gabriel to those nearest\r\nto him. The corn stood on stone staddles, and between these, tongues of\r\nyellow hue from the burning straw licked and darted playfully. If the\r\nfire once got _under_ this stack, all would be lost.\r\n\r\n\u201CGet a tarpaulin\u2014quick!\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\nA rick-cloth was brought, and they hung it like a curtain across the\r\nchannel. The flames immediately ceased to go under the bottom of the\r\ncorn-stack, and stood up vertical.\r\n\r\n\u201CStand here with a bucket of water and keep the cloth wet.\u201D said\r\nGabriel again.\r\n\r\nThe flames, now driven upwards, began to attack the angles of the huge\r\nroof covering the wheat-stack.\r\n\r\n\u201CA ladder,\u201D cried Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe ladder was against the straw-rick and is burnt to a cinder,\u201D said\r\na spectre-like form in the smoke.\r\n\r\nOak seized the cut ends of the sheaves, as if he were going to engage\r\nin the operation of \u201Creed-drawing,\u201D and digging in his feet, and\r\noccasionally sticking in the stem of his sheep-crook, he clambered up\r\nthe beetling face. He at once sat astride the very apex, and began with\r\nhis crook to beat off the fiery fragments which had lodged thereon,\r\nshouting to the others to get him a bough and a ladder, and some water.\r\n\r\nBilly Smallbury\u2014one of the men who had been on the waggon\u2014by this time\r\nhad found a ladder, which Mark Clark ascended, holding on beside Oak\r\nupon the thatch. The smoke at this corner was stifling, and Clark, a\r\nnimble fellow, having been handed a bucket of water, bathed Oak\u2019s face\r\nand sprinkled him generally, whilst Gabriel, now with a long\r\nbeech-bough in one hand, in addition to his crook in the other, kept\r\nsweeping the stack and dislodging all fiery particles.\r\n\r\nOn the ground the groups of villagers were still occupied in doing all\r\nthey could to keep down the conflagration, which was not much. They\r\nwere all tinged orange, and backed up by shadows of varying pattern.\r\nRound the corner of the largest stack, out of the direct rays of the\r\nfire, stood a pony, bearing a young woman on its back. By her side was\r\nanother woman, on foot. These two seemed to keep at a distance from the\r\nfire, that the horse might not become restive.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s a shepherd,\u201D said the woman on foot. \u201CYes\u2014he is. See how his\r\ncrook shines as he beats the rick with it. And his smock-frock is burnt\r\nin two holes, I declare! A fine young shepherd he is too, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhose shepherd is he?\u201D said the equestrian in a clear voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t know, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t any of the others know?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNobody at all\u2014I\u2019ve asked \u2019em. Quite a stranger, they say.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe young woman on the pony rode out from the shade and looked\r\nanxiously around.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you think the barn is safe?\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CD\u2019ye think the barn is safe, Jan Coggan?\u201D said the second woman,\r\npassing on the question to the nearest man in that direction.\r\n\r\n\u201CSafe now\u2014leastwise I think so. If this rick had gone the barn would\r\nhave followed. \u2019Tis that bold shepherd up there that have done the most\r\ngood\u2014he sitting on the top o\u2019 rick, whizzing his great long arms about\r\nlike a windmill.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe does work hard,\u201D said the young woman on horseback, looking up at\r\nGabriel through her thick woollen veil. \u201CI wish he was shepherd here.\r\nDon\u2019t any of you know his name.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever heard the man\u2019s name in my life, or seed his form afore.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe fire began to get worsted, and Gabriel\u2019s elevated position being no\r\nlonger required of him, he made as if to descend.\r\n\r\n\u201CMaryann,\u201D said the girl on horseback, \u201Cgo to him as he comes down, and\r\nsay that the farmer wishes to thank him for the great service he has\r\ndone.\u201D\r\n\r\nMaryann stalked off towards the rick and met Oak at the foot of the\r\nladder. She delivered her message.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere is your master the farmer?\u201D asked Gabriel, kindling with the\r\nidea of getting employment that seemed to strike him now.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tisn\u2019t a master; \u2019tis a mistress, shepherd.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA woman farmer?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, \u2019a b\u2019lieve, and a rich one too!\u201D said a bystander. \u201CLately \u2019a came\r\nhere from a distance. Took on her uncle\u2019s farm, who died suddenly. Used\r\nto measure his money in half-pint cups. They say now that she\u2019ve\r\nbusiness in every bank in Casterbridge, and thinks no more of playing\r\npitch-and-toss sovereign than you and I do pitch-halfpenny\u2014not a bit in\r\nthe world, shepherd.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s she, back there upon the pony,\u201D said Maryann; \u201Cwi\u2019 her face\r\na-covered up in that black cloth with holes in it.\u201D\r\n\r\nOak, his features smudged, grimy, and undiscoverable from the smoke and\r\nheat, his smock-frock burnt into holes and dripping with water, the ash\r\nstem of his sheep-crook charred six inches shorter, advanced with the\r\nhumility stern adversity had thrust upon him up to the slight female\r\nform in the saddle. He lifted his hat with respect, and not without\r\ngallantry: stepping close to her hanging feet he said in a hesitating\r\nvoice,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you happen to want a shepherd, ma\u2019am?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe lifted the wool veil tied round her face, and looked all\r\nastonishment. Gabriel and his cold-hearted darling, Bathsheba Everdene,\r\nwere face to face.\r\n\r\nBathsheba did not speak, and he mechanically repeated in an abashed and\r\nsad voice,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you want a shepherd, ma\u2019am?\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nRECOGNITION\u2014A TIMID GIRL\r\n\r\n\r\nBathsheba withdrew into the shade. She scarcely knew whether most to be\r\namused at the singularity of the meeting, or to be concerned at its\r\nawkwardness. There was room for a little pity, also for a very little\r\nexultation: the former at his position, the latter at her own.\r\nEmbarrassed she was not, and she remembered Gabriel\u2019s declaration of\r\nlove to her at Norcombe only to think she had nearly forgotten it.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D she murmured, putting on an air of dignity, and turning again to\r\nhim with a little warmth of cheek; \u201CI do want a shepherd. But\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s the very man, ma\u2019am,\u201D said one of the villagers, quietly.\r\n\r\nConviction breeds conviction. \u201CAy, that \u2019a is,\u201D said a second,\r\ndecisively.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe man, truly!\u201D said a third, with heartiness.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s all there!\u201D said number four, fervidly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen will you tell him to speak to the bailiff?\u201D said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nAll was practical again now. A summer eve and loneliness would have\r\nbeen necessary to give the meeting its proper fulness of romance.\r\n\r\nThe bailiff was pointed out to Gabriel, who, checking the palpitation\r\nwithin his breast at discovering that this Ashtoreth of strange report\r\nwas only a modification of Venus the well-known and admired, retired\r\nwith him to talk over the necessary preliminaries of hiring.\r\n\r\nThe fire before them wasted away. \u201CMen,\u201D said Bathsheba, \u201Cyou shall\r\ntake a little refreshment after this extra work. Will you come to the\r\nhouse?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe could knock in a bit and a drop a good deal freer, Miss, if so be\r\nye\u2019d send it to Warren\u2019s Malthouse,\u201D replied the spokesman.\r\n\r\nBathsheba then rode off into the darkness, and the men straggled on to\r\nthe village in twos and threes\u2014Oak and the bailiff being left by the\r\nrick alone.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd now,\u201D said the bailiff, finally, \u201Call is settled, I think, about\r\nyour coming, and I am going home-along. Good-night to ye, shepherd.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCan you get me a lodging?\u201D inquired Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat I can\u2019t, indeed,\u201D he said, moving past Oak as a Christian edges\r\npast an offertory-plate when he does not mean to contribute. \u201CIf you\r\nfollow on the road till you come to Warren\u2019s Malthouse, where they are\r\nall gone to have their snap of victuals, I daresay some of \u2019em will\r\ntell you of a place. Good-night to ye, shepherd.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe bailiff who showed this nervous dread of loving his neighbour as\r\nhimself, went up the hill, and Oak walked on to the village, still\r\nastonished at the reencounter with Bathsheba, glad of his nearness to\r\nher, and perplexed at the rapidity with which the unpractised girl of\r\nNorcombe had developed into the supervising and cool woman here. But\r\nsome women only require an emergency to make them fit for one.\r\n\r\nObliged, to some extent, to forgo dreaming in order to find the way, he\r\nreached the churchyard, and passed round it under the wall where\r\nseveral ancient trees grew. There was a wide margin of grass along\r\nhere, and Gabriel\u2019s footsteps were deadened by its softness, even at\r\nthis indurating period of the year. When abreast of a trunk which\r\nappeared to be the oldest of the old, he became aware that a figure was\r\nstanding behind it. Gabriel did not pause in his walk, and in another\r\nmoment he accidentally kicked a loose stone. The noise was enough to\r\ndisturb the motionless stranger, who started and assumed a careless\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nIt was a slim girl, rather thinly clad.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood-night to you,\u201D said Gabriel, heartily.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood-night,\u201D said the girl to Gabriel.\r\n\r\nThe voice was unexpectedly attractive; it was the low and dulcet note\r\nsuggestive of romance; common in descriptions, rare in experience.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll thank you to tell me if I\u2019m in the way for Warren\u2019s Malthouse?\u201D\r\nGabriel resumed, primarily to gain the information, indirectly to get\r\nmore of the music.\r\n\r\n\u201CQuite right. It\u2019s at the bottom of the hill. And do you know\u2014\u201D The\r\ngirl hesitated and then went on again. \u201CDo you know how late they keep\r\nopen the Buck\u2019s Head Inn?\u201D She seemed to be won by Gabriel\u2019s\r\nheartiness, as Gabriel had been won by her modulations.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know where the Buck\u2019s Head is, or anything about it. Do you\r\nthink of going there to-night?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014\u201D The woman again paused. There was no necessity for any\r\ncontinuance of speech, and the fact that she did add more seemed to\r\nproceed from an unconscious desire to show unconcern by making a\r\nremark, which is noticeable in the ingenuous when they are acting by\r\nstealth. \u201CYou are not a Weatherbury man?\u201D she said, timorously.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am not. I am the new shepherd\u2014just arrived.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COnly a shepherd\u2014and you seem almost a farmer by your ways.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COnly a shepherd,\u201D Gabriel repeated, in a dull cadence of finality. His\r\nthoughts were directed to the past, his eyes to the feet of the girl;\r\nand for the first time he saw lying there a bundle of some sort. She\r\nmay have perceived the direction of his face, for she said coaxingly,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CYou won\u2019t say anything in the parish about having seen me here, will\r\nyou\u2014at least, not for a day or two?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t if you wish me not to,\u201D said Oak.\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, indeed,\u201D the other replied. \u201CI am rather poor, and I don\u2019t\r\nwant people to know anything about me.\u201D Then she was silent and\r\nshivered.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou ought to have a cloak on such a cold night,\u201D Gabriel observed. \u201CI\r\nwould advise \u2019ee to get indoors.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CO no! Would you mind going on and leaving me? I thank you much for\r\nwhat you have told me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will go on,\u201D he said; adding hesitatingly,\u2014\u201CSince you are not very\r\nwell off, perhaps you would accept this trifle from me. It is only a\r\nshilling, but it is all I have to spare.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I will take it,\u201D said the stranger gratefully.\r\n\r\nShe extended her hand; Gabriel his. In feeling for each other\u2019s palm in\r\nthe gloom before the money could be passed, a minute incident occurred\r\nwhich told much. Gabriel\u2019s fingers alighted on the young woman\u2019s wrist.\r\nIt was beating with a throb of tragic intensity. He had frequently felt\r\nthe same quick, hard beat in the femoral artery of his lambs when\r\noverdriven. It suggested a consumption too great of a vitality which,\r\nto judge from her figure and stature, was already too little.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is the matter?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNothing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut there is?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, no! Let your having seen me be a secret!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well; I will. Good-night, again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood-night.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe young girl remained motionless by the tree, and Gabriel descended\r\ninto the village of Weatherbury, or Lower Longpuddle as it was\r\nsometimes called. He fancied that he had felt himself in the penumbra\r\nof a very deep sadness when touching that slight and fragile creature.\r\nBut wisdom lies in moderating mere impressions, and Gabriel endeavoured\r\nto think little of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nTHE MALTHOUSE\u2014THE CHAT\u2014NEWS\r\n\r\n\r\nWarren\u2019s Malthouse was enclosed by an old wall inwrapped with ivy, and\r\nthough not much of the exterior was visible at this hour, the character\r\nand purposes of the building were clearly enough shown by its outline\r\nupon the sky. From the walls an overhanging thatched roof sloped up to\r\na point in the centre, upon which rose a small wooden lantern, fitted\r\nwith louvre-boards on all the four sides, and from these openings a\r\nmist was dimly perceived to be escaping into the night air. There was\r\nno window in front; but a square hole in the door was glazed with a\r\nsingle pane, through which red, comfortable rays now stretched out upon\r\nthe ivied wall in front. Voices were to be heard inside.\r\n\r\nOak\u2019s hand skimmed the surface of the door with fingers extended to an\r\nElymas-the-Sorcerer pattern, till he found a leathern strap, which he\r\npulled. This lifted a wooden latch, and the door swung open.\r\n\r\nThe room inside was lighted only by the ruddy glow from the kiln mouth,\r\nwhich shone over the floor with the streaming horizontality of the\r\nsetting sun, and threw upwards the shadows of all facial irregularities\r\nin those assembled around. The stone-flag floor was worn into a path\r\nfrom the doorway to the kiln, and into undulations everywhere. A curved\r\nsettle of unplaned oak stretched along one side, and in a remote corner\r\nwas a small bed and bedstead, the owner and frequent occupier of which\r\nwas the maltster.\r\n\r\nThis aged man was now sitting opposite the fire, his frosty white hair\r\nand beard overgrowing his gnarled figure like the grey moss and lichen\r\nupon a leafless apple-tree. He wore breeches and the laced-up shoes\r\ncalled ankle-jacks; he kept his eyes fixed upon the fire.\r\n\r\nGabriel\u2019s nose was greeted by an atmosphere laden with the sweet smell\r\nof new malt. The conversation (which seemed to have been concerning the\r\norigin of the fire) immediately ceased, and every one ocularly\r\ncriticised him to the degree expressed by contracting the flesh of\r\ntheir foreheads and looking at him with narrowed eyelids, as if he had\r\nbeen a light too strong for their sight. Several exclaimed\r\nmeditatively, after this operation had been completed:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201COh, \u2019tis the new shepherd, \u2019a b\u2019lieve.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe thought we heard a hand pawing about the door for the bobbin, but\r\nweren\u2019t sure \u2019twere not a dead leaf blowed across,\u201D said another. \u201CCome\r\nin, shepherd; sure ye be welcome, though we don\u2019t know yer name.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGabriel Oak, that\u2019s my name, neighbours.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe ancient maltster sitting in the midst turned at this\u2014his turning\r\nbeing as the turning of a rusty crane.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s never Gable Oak\u2019s grandson over at Norcombe\u2014never!\u201D he said, as\r\na formula expressive of surprise, which nobody was supposed for a\r\nmoment to take literally.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy father and my grandfather were old men of the name of Gabriel,\u201D\r\nsaid the shepherd, placidly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThought I knowed the man\u2019s face as I seed him on the rick!\u2014thought I\r\ndid! And where be ye trading o\u2019t to now, shepherd?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m thinking of biding here,\u201D said Mr. Oak.\r\n\r\n\u201CKnowed yer grandfather for years and years!\u201D continued the maltster,\r\nthe words coming forth of their own accord as if the momentum\r\npreviously imparted had been sufficient.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh\u2014and did you!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CKnowed yer grandmother.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd her too!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLikewise knowed yer father when he was a child. Why, my boy Jacob\r\nthere and your father were sworn brothers\u2014that they were sure\u2014weren\u2019t\r\nye, Jacob?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, sure,\u201D said his son, a young man about sixty-five, with a\r\nsemi-bald head and one tooth in the left centre of his upper jaw, which\r\nmade much of itself by standing prominent, like a milestone in a bank.\r\n\u201CBut \u2019twas Joe had most to do with him. However, my son William must\r\nhave knowed the very man afore us\u2014didn\u2019t ye, Billy, afore ye left\r\nNorcombe?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, \u2019twas Andrew,\u201D said Jacob\u2019s son Billy, a child of forty, or\r\nthereabouts, who manifested the peculiarity of possessing a cheerful\r\nsoul in a gloomy body, and whose whiskers were assuming a chinchilla\r\nshade here and there.\r\n\r\n\u201CI can mind Andrew,\u201D said Oak, \u201Cas being a man in the place when I was\r\nquite a child.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy\u2014the other day I and my youngest daughter, Liddy, were over at my\r\ngrandson\u2019s christening,\u201D continued Billy. \u201CWe were talking about this\r\nvery family, and \u2019twas only last Purification Day in this very world,\r\nwhen the use-money is gied away to the second-best poor folk, you know,\r\nshepherd, and I can mind the day because they all had to traypse up to\r\nthe vestry\u2014yes, this very man\u2019s family.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, shepherd, and drink. \u2019Tis gape and swaller with us\u2014a drap of\r\nsommit, but not of much account,\u201D said the maltster, removing from the\r\nfire his eyes, which were vermilion-red and bleared by gazing into it\r\nfor so many years. \u201CTake up the God-forgive-me, Jacob. See if \u2019tis\r\nwarm, Jacob.\u201D\r\n\r\nJacob stooped to the God-forgive-me, which was a two-handled tall mug\r\nstanding in the ashes, cracked and charred with heat: it was rather\r\nfurred with extraneous matter about the outside, especially in the\r\ncrevices of the handles, the innermost curves of which may not have\r\nseen daylight for several years by reason of this encrustation\r\nthereon\u2014formed of ashes accidentally wetted with cider and baked hard;\r\nbut to the mind of any sensible drinker the cup was no worse for that,\r\nbeing incontestably clean on the inside and about the rim. It may be\r\nobserved that such a class of mug is called a God-forgive-me in\r\nWeatherbury and its vicinity for uncertain reasons; probably because\r\nits size makes any given toper feel ashamed of himself when he sees its\r\nbottom in drinking it empty.\r\n\r\nJacob, on receiving the order to see if the liquor was warm enough,\r\nplacidly dipped his forefinger into it by way of thermometer, and\r\nhaving pronounced it nearly of the proper degree, raised the cup and\r\nvery civilly attempted to dust some of the ashes from the bottom with\r\nthe skirt of his smock-frock, because Shepherd Oak was a stranger.\r\n\r\n\u201CA clane cup for the shepherd,\u201D said the maltster commandingly.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo\u2014not at all,\u201D said Gabriel, in a reproving tone of considerateness.\r\n\u201CI never fuss about dirt in its pure state, and when I know what sort\r\nit is.\u201D Taking the mug he drank an inch or more from the depth of its\r\ncontents, and duly passed it to the next man. \u201CI wouldn\u2019t think of\r\ngiving such trouble to neighbours in washing up when there\u2019s so much\r\nwork to be done in the world already,\u201D continued Oak in a moister tone,\r\nafter recovering from the stoppage of breath which is occasioned by\r\npulls at large mugs.\r\n\r\n\u201CA right sensible man,\u201D said Jacob.\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue, true; it can\u2019t be gainsaid!\u201D observed a brisk young man\u2014Mark\r\nClark by name, a genial and pleasant gentleman, whom to meet anywhere\r\nin your travels was to know, to know was to drink with, and to drink\r\nwith was, unfortunately, to pay for.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd here\u2019s a mouthful of bread and bacon that mis\u2019ess have sent,\r\nshepherd. The cider will go down better with a bit of victuals. Don\u2019t\r\nye chaw quite close, shepherd, for I let the bacon fall in the road\r\noutside as I was bringing it along, and may be \u2019tis rather gritty.\r\nThere, \u2019tis clane dirt; and we all know what that is, as you say, and\r\nyou bain\u2019t a particular man we see, shepherd.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue, true\u2014not at all,\u201D said the friendly Oak.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t let your teeth quite meet, and you won\u2019t feel the sandiness at\r\nall. Ah! \u2019tis wonderful what can be done by contrivance!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy own mind exactly, neighbour.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, he\u2019s his grandfer\u2019s own grandson!\u2014his grandfer were just such a\r\nnice unparticular man!\u201D said the maltster.\r\n\r\n\u201CDrink, Henry Fray\u2014drink,\u201D magnanimously said Jan Coggan, a person who\r\nheld Saint-Simonian notions of share and share alike where liquor was\r\nconcerned, as the vessel showed signs of approaching him in its gradual\r\nrevolution among them.\r\n\r\nHaving at this moment reached the end of a wistful gaze into mid-air,\r\nHenry did not refuse. He was a man of more than middle age, with\r\neyebrows high up in his forehead, who laid it down that the law of the\r\nworld was bad, with a long-suffering look through his listeners at the\r\nworld alluded to, as it presented itself to his imagination. He always\r\nsigned his name \u201CHenery\u201D\u2014strenuously insisting upon that spelling, and\r\nif any passing schoolmaster ventured to remark that the second \u201Ce\u201D was\r\nsuperfluous and old-fashioned, he received the reply that \u201CH-e-n-e-r-y\u201D\r\nwas the name he was christened and the name he would stick to\u2014in the\r\ntone of one to whom orthographical differences were matters which had a\r\ngreat deal to do with personal character.\r\n\r\nMr. Jan Coggan, who had passed the cup to Henery, was a crimson man\r\nwith a spacious countenance and private glimmer in his eye, whose name\r\nhad appeared on the marriage register of Weatherbury and neighbouring\r\nparishes as best man and chief witness in countless unions of the\r\nprevious twenty years; he also very frequently filled the post of head\r\ngodfather in baptisms of the subtly-jovial kind.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, Mark Clark\u2014come. Ther\u2019s plenty more in the barrel,\u201D said Jan.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy\u2014that I will, \u2019tis my only doctor,\u201D replied Mr. Clark, who, twenty\r\nyears younger than Jan Coggan, revolved in the same orbit. He secreted\r\nmirth on all occasions for special discharge at popular parties.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, Joseph Poorgrass, ye han\u2019t had a drop!\u201D said Mr. Coggan to a\r\nself-conscious man in the background, thrusting the cup towards him.\r\n\r\n\u201CSuch a modest man as he is!\u201D said Jacob Smallbury. \u201CWhy, ye\u2019ve hardly\r\nhad strength of eye enough to look in our young mis\u2019ess\u2019s face, so I\r\nhear, Joseph?\u201D\r\n\r\nAll looked at Joseph Poorgrass with pitying reproach.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo\u2014I\u2019ve hardly looked at her at all,\u201D simpered Joseph, reducing his\r\nbody smaller whilst talking, apparently from a meek sense of undue\r\nprominence. \u201CAnd when I seed her, \u2019twas nothing but blushes with me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPoor feller,\u201D said Mr. Clark.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis a curious nature for a man,\u201D said Jan Coggan.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D continued Joseph Poorgrass\u2014his shyness, which was so painful as\r\na defect, filling him with a mild complacency now that it was regarded\r\nas an interesting study. \u201C\u2019Twere blush, blush, blush with me every\r\nminute of the time, when she was speaking to me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI believe ye, Joseph Poorgrass, for we all know ye to be a very\r\nbashful man.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis a\u2019 awkward gift for a man, poor soul,\u201D said the maltster. \u201CAnd\r\nhow long have ye have suffered from it, Joseph?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, ever since I was a boy. Yes\u2014mother was concerned to her heart\r\nabout it\u2014yes. But \u2019twas all nought.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDid ye ever go into the world to try and stop it, Joseph Poorgrass?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh ay, tried all sorts o\u2019 company. They took me to Greenhill Fair, and\r\ninto a great gay jerry-go-nimble show, where there were women-folk\r\nriding round\u2014standing upon horses, with hardly anything on but their\r\nsmocks; but it didn\u2019t cure me a morsel. And then I was put errand-man\r\nat the Women\u2019s Skittle Alley at the back of the Tailor\u2019s Arms in\r\nCasterbridge. \u2019Twas a horrible sinful situation, and a very curious\r\nplace for a good man. I had to stand and look ba\u2019dy people in the face\r\nfrom morning till night; but \u2019twas no use\u2014I was just as bad as ever\r\nafter all. Blushes hev been in the family for generations. There, \u2019tis\r\na happy providence that I be no worse.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue,\u201D said Jacob Smallbury, deepening his thoughts to a profounder\r\nview of the subject. \u201C\u2019Tis a thought to look at, that ye might have\r\nbeen worse; but even as you be, \u2019tis a very bad affliction for \u2019ee,\r\nJoseph. For ye see, shepherd, though \u2019tis very well for a woman, dang\r\nit all, \u2019tis awkward for a man like him, poor feller?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis\u2014\u2019tis,\u201D said Gabriel, recovering from a meditation. \u201CYes, very\r\nawkward for the man.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, and he\u2019s very timid, too,\u201D observed Jan Coggan. \u201COnce he had been\r\nworking late at Yalbury Bottom, and had had a drap of drink, and lost\r\nhis way as he was coming home-along through Yalbury Wood, didn\u2019t ye,\r\nMaster Poorgrass?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, no; not that story!\u201D expostulated the modest man, forcing a\r\nlaugh to bury his concern.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014And so \u2019a lost himself quite,\u201D continued Mr. Coggan, with an\r\nimpassive face, implying that a true narrative, like time and tide,\r\nmust run its course and would respect no man. \u201CAnd as he was coming\r\nalong in the middle of the night, much afeared, and not able to find\r\nhis way out of the trees nohow, \u2019a cried out, \u2018Man-a-lost! man-a-lost!\u2019\r\nA owl in a tree happened to be crying \u2018Whoo-whoo-whoo!\u2019 as owls do, you\r\nknow, shepherd\u201D (Gabriel nodded), \u201Cand Joseph, all in a tremble, said,\r\n\u2018Joseph Poorgrass, of Weatherbury, sir!\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, now\u2014that\u2019s too much!\u201D said the timid man, becoming a man of\r\nbrazen courage all of a sudden. \u201CI didn\u2019t say _sir_. I\u2019ll take my oath\r\nI didn\u2019t say \u2018Joseph Poorgrass o\u2019 Weatherbury, sir.\u2019 No, no; what\u2019s\r\nright is right, and I never said sir to the bird, knowing very well\r\nthat no man of a gentleman\u2019s rank would be hollering there at that time\r\no\u2019 night. \u2018Joseph Poorgrass of Weatherbury,\u2019\u2014that\u2019s every word I said,\r\nand I shouldn\u2019t ha\u2019 said that if \u2019t hadn\u2019t been for Keeper Day\u2019s\r\nmetheglin.... There, \u2019twas a merciful thing it ended where it did.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe question of which was right being tacitly waived by the company,\r\nJan went on meditatively:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd he\u2019s the fearfullest man, bain\u2019t ye, Joseph? Ay, another time ye\r\nwere lost by Lambing-Down Gate, weren\u2019t ye, Joseph?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI was,\u201D replied Poorgrass, as if there were some conditions too\r\nserious even for modesty to remember itself under, this being one.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; that were the middle of the night, too. The gate would not open,\r\ntry how he would, and knowing there was the Devil\u2019s hand in it, he\r\nkneeled down.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy,\u201D said Joseph, acquiring confidence from the warmth of the fire,\r\nthe cider, and a perception of the narrative capabilities of the\r\nexperience alluded to. \u201CMy heart died within me, that time; but I\r\nkneeled down and said the Lord\u2019s Prayer, and then the Belief right\r\nthrough, and then the Ten Commandments, in earnest prayer. But no, the\r\ngate wouldn\u2019t open; and then I went on with Dearly Beloved Brethren,\r\nand, thinks I, this makes four, and \u2019tis all I know out of book, and if\r\nthis don\u2019t do it nothing will, and I\u2019m a lost man. Well, when I got to\r\nSaying After Me, I rose from my knees and found the gate would\r\nopen\u2014yes, neighbours, the gate opened the same as ever.\u201D\r\n\r\nA meditation on the obvious inference was indulged in by all, and\r\nduring its continuance each directed his vision into the ashpit, which\r\nglowed like a desert in the tropics under a vertical sun, shaping their\r\neyes long and liny, partly because of the light, partly from the depth\r\nof the subject discussed.\r\n\r\nGabriel broke the silence. \u201CWhat sort of a place is this to live at,\r\nand what sort of a mis\u2019ess is she to work under?\u201D Gabriel\u2019s bosom\r\nthrilled gently as he thus slipped under the notice of the assembly the\r\ninner-most subject of his heart.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe d\u2019 know little of her\u2014nothing. She only showed herself a few days\r\nago. Her uncle was took bad, and the doctor was called with his\r\nworld-wide skill; but he couldn\u2019t save the man. As I take it, she\u2019s\r\ngoing to keep on the farm.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s about the shape o\u2019t, \u2019a b\u2019lieve,\u201D said Jan Coggan. \u201CAy, \u2019tis a\r\nvery good family. I\u2019d as soon be under \u2019em as under one here and there.\r\nHer uncle was a very fair sort of man. Did ye know en, shepherd\u2014a\r\nbachelor-man?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI used to go to his house a-courting my first wife, Charlotte, who was\r\nhis dairymaid. Well, a very good-hearted man were Farmer Everdene, and\r\nI being a respectable young fellow was allowed to call and see her and\r\ndrink as much ale as I liked, but not to carry away any\u2014outside my skin\r\nI mane of course.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, ay, Jan Coggan; we know yer maning.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd so you see \u2019twas beautiful ale, and I wished to value his kindness\r\nas much as I could, and not to be so ill-mannered as to drink only a\r\nthimbleful, which would have been insulting the man\u2019s generosity\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue, Master Coggan, \u2019twould so,\u201D corroborated Mark Clark.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014And so I used to eat a lot of salt fish afore going, and then by the\r\ntime I got there I were as dry as a lime-basket\u2014so thorough dry that\r\nthat ale would slip down\u2014ah, \u2019twould slip down sweet! Happy times!\r\nHeavenly times! Such lovely drunks as I used to have at that house! You\r\ncan mind, Jacob? You used to go wi\u2019 me sometimes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2014I can,\u201D said Jacob. \u201CThat one, too, that we had at Buck\u2019s Head\r\non a White Monday was a pretty tipple.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Twas. But for a wet of the better class, that brought you no nearer\r\nto the horned man than you were afore you begun, there was none like\r\nthose in Farmer Everdene\u2019s kitchen. Not a single damn allowed; no, not\r\na bare poor one, even at the most cheerful moment when all were\r\nblindest, though the good old word of sin thrown in here and there at\r\nsuch times is a great relief to a merry soul.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue,\u201D said the maltster. \u201CNater requires her swearing at the regular\r\ntimes, or she\u2019s not herself; and unholy exclamations is a necessity of\r\nlife.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut Charlotte,\u201D continued Coggan\u2014\u201Cnot a word of the sort would\r\nCharlotte allow, nor the smallest item of taking in vain.... Ay, poor\r\nCharlotte, I wonder if she had the good fortune to get into Heaven when\r\n\u2019a died! But \u2019a was never much in luck\u2019s way, and perhaps \u2019a went\r\ndownwards after all, poor soul.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd did any of you know Miss Everdene\u2019s father and mother?\u201D inquired\r\nthe shepherd, who found some difficulty in keeping the conversation in\r\nthe desired channel.\r\n\r\n\u201CI knew them a little,\u201D said Jacob Smallbury; \u201Cbut they were townsfolk,\r\nand didn\u2019t live here. They\u2019ve been dead for years. Father, what sort of\r\npeople were mis\u2019ess\u2019 father and mother?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D said the maltster, \u201Che wasn\u2019t much to look at; but she was a\r\nlovely woman. He was fond enough of her as his sweetheart.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CUsed to kiss her scores and long-hundreds o\u2019 times, so \u2019twas said,\u201D\r\nobserved Coggan.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe was very proud of her, too, when they were married, as I\u2019ve been\r\ntold,\u201D said the maltster.\r\n\u201CAy,\u201D said Coggan. \u201CHe admired her so much that he used to light the\r\ncandle three times a night to look at her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBoundless love; I shouldn\u2019t have supposed it in the universe!\u201D\r\nmurmured Joseph Poorgrass, who habitually spoke on a large scale in his\r\nmoral reflections.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, to be sure,\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, \u2019tis true enough. I knowed the man and woman both well. Levi\r\nEverdene\u2014that was the man\u2019s name, sure. \u2018Man,\u2019 saith I in my hurry, but\r\nhe were of a higher circle of life than that\u2014\u2019a was a gentleman-tailor\r\nreally, worth scores of pounds. And he became a very celebrated\r\nbankrupt two or three times.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, I thought he was quite a common man!\u201D said Joseph.\r\n\r\n\u201COh no, no! That man failed for heaps of money; hundreds in gold and\r\nsilver.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe maltster being rather short of breath, Mr. Coggan, after absently\r\nscrutinising a coal which had fallen among the ashes, took up the\r\nnarrative, with a private twirl of his eye:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, now, you\u2019d hardly believe it, but that man\u2014our Miss Everdene\u2019s\r\nfather\u2014was one of the ficklest husbands alive, after a while.\r\nUnderstand? \u2019a didn\u2019t want to be fickle, but he couldn\u2019t help it. The\r\npore feller were faithful and true enough to her in his wish, but his\r\nheart would rove, do what he would. He spoke to me in real tribulation\r\nabout it once. \u2018Coggan,\u2019 he said, \u2018I could never wish for a handsomer\r\nwoman than I\u2019ve got, but feeling she\u2019s ticketed as my lawful wife, I\r\ncan\u2019t help my wicked heart wandering, do what I will.\u2019 But at last I\r\nbelieve he cured it by making her take off her wedding-ring and calling\r\nher by her maiden name as they sat together after the shop was shut,\r\nand so \u2019a would get to fancy she was only his sweetheart, and not\r\nmarried to him at all. And as soon as he could thoroughly fancy he was\r\ndoing wrong and committing the seventh, \u2019a got to like her as well as\r\never, and they lived on a perfect picture of mutel love.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, \u2019twas a most ungodly remedy,\u201D murmured Joseph Poorgrass; \u201Cbut we\r\nought to feel deep cheerfulness that a happy Providence kept it from\r\nbeing any worse. You see, he might have gone the bad road and given his\r\neyes to unlawfulness entirely\u2014yes, gross unlawfulness, so to say it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou see,\u201D said Billy Smallbury, \u201CThe man\u2019s will was to do right, sure\r\nenough, but his heart didn\u2019t chime in.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe got so much better, that he was quite godly in his later years,\r\nwasn\u2019t he, Jan?\u201D said Joseph Poorgrass. \u201CHe got himself confirmed over\r\nagain in a more serious way, and took to saying \u2018Amen\u2019 almost as loud\r\nas the clerk, and he liked to copy comforting verses from the\r\ntombstones. He used, too, to hold the money-plate at Let Your Light so\r\nShine, and stand godfather to poor little come-by-chance children; and\r\nhe kept a missionary box upon his table to nab folks unawares when they\r\ncalled; yes, and he would box the charity-boys\u2019 ears, if they laughed\r\nin church, till they could hardly stand upright, and do other deeds of\r\npiety natural to the saintly inclined.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, at that time he thought of nothing but high things,\u201D added Billy\r\nSmallbury. \u201COne day Parson Thirdly met him and said, \u2018Good-Morning,\r\nMister Everdene; \u2019tis a fine day!\u2019 \u2018Amen\u2019 said Everdene, quite\r\nabsent-like, thinking only of religion when he seed a parson. Yes, he\r\nwas a very Christian man.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTheir daughter was not at all a pretty chiel at that time,\u201D said\r\nHenery Fray. \u201CNever should have thought she\u2019d have growed up such a\r\nhandsome body as she is.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis to be hoped her temper is as good as her face.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, yes; but the baily will have most to do with the business and\r\nourselves. Ah!\u201D Henery gazed into the ashpit, and smiled volumes of\r\nironical knowledge.\r\n\r\n\u201CA queer Christian, like the Devil\u2019s head in a cowl,[1] as the saying\r\nis,\u201D volunteered Mark Clark.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is,\u201D said Henery, implying that irony must cease at a certain\r\npoint. \u201CBetween we two, man and man, I believe that man would as soon\r\ntell a lie Sundays as working-days\u2014that I do so.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood faith, you do talk!\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue enough,\u201D said the man of bitter moods, looking round upon the\r\ncompany with the antithetic laughter that comes from a keener\r\nappreciation of the miseries of life than ordinary men are capable of.\r\n\u201CAh, there\u2019s people of one sort, and people of another, but that\r\nman\u2014bless your souls!\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel thought fit to change the subject. \u201CYou must be a very aged\r\nman, malter, to have sons growed mild and ancient,\u201D he remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201CFather\u2019s so old that \u2019a can\u2019t mind his age, can ye, father?\u201D\r\ninterposed Jacob. \u201CAnd he\u2019s growed terrible crooked too, lately,\u201D Jacob\r\ncontinued, surveying his father\u2019s figure, which was rather more bowed\r\nthan his own. \u201CReally one may say that father there is three-double.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCrooked folk will last a long while,\u201D said the maltster, grimly, and\r\nnot in the best humour.\r\n\r\n\u201CShepherd would like to hear the pedigree of yer life, father\u2014wouldn\u2019t\r\nye, shepherd?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, that I should,\u201D said Gabriel with the heartiness of a man who had\r\nlonged to hear it for several months. \u201CWhat may your age be, malter?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe maltster cleared his throat in an exaggerated form for emphasis,\r\nand elongating his gaze to the remotest point of the ashpit, said, in\r\nthe slow speech justifiable when the importance of a subject is so\r\ngenerally felt that any mannerism must be tolerated in getting at it,\r\n\u201CWell, I don\u2019t mind the year I were born in, but perhaps I can reckon\r\nup the places I\u2019ve lived at, and so get it that way. I bode at Upper\r\nLongpuddle across there\u201D (nodding to the north) \u201Ctill I were eleven. I\r\nbode seven at Kingsbere\u201D (nodding to the east) \u201Cwhere I took to\r\nmalting. I went therefrom to Norcombe, and malted there two-and-twenty\r\nyears, and-two-and-twenty years I was there turnip-hoeing and\r\nharvesting. Ah, I knowed that old place, Norcombe, years afore you were\r\nthought of, Master Oak\u201D (Oak smiled sincere belief in the fact). \u201CThen\r\nI malted at Durnover four year, and four year turnip-hoeing; and I was\r\nfourteen times eleven months at Millpond St. Jude\u2019s\u201D (nodding\r\nnorth-west-by-north). \u201COld Twills wouldn\u2019t hire me for more than eleven\r\nmonths at a time, to keep me from being chargeable to the parish if so\r\nbe I was disabled. Then I was three year at Mellstock, and I\u2019ve been\r\nhere one-and-thirty year come Candlemas. How much is that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHundred and seventeen,\u201D chuckled another old gentleman, given to\r\nmental arithmetic and little conversation, who had hitherto sat\r\nunobserved in a corner.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, then, that\u2019s my age,\u201D said the maltster, emphatically.\r\n\r\n\u201CO no, father!\u201D said Jacob. \u201CYour turnip-hoeing were in the summer and\r\nyour malting in the winter of the same years, and ye don\u2019t ought to\r\ncount-both halves, father.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CChok\u2019 it all! I lived through the summers, didn\u2019t I? That\u2019s my\r\nquestion. I suppose ye\u2019ll say next I be no age at all to speak of?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSure we shan\u2019t,\u201D said Gabriel, soothingly.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe be a very old aged person, malter,\u201D attested Jan Coggan, also\r\nsoothingly. \u201CWe all know that, and ye must have a wonderful talented\r\nconstitution to be able to live so long, mustn\u2019t he, neighbours?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue, true; ye must, malter, wonderful,\u201D said the meeting unanimously.\r\n\r\nThe maltster, being now pacified, was even generous enough to\r\nvoluntarily disparage in a slight degree the virtue of having lived a\r\ngreat many years, by mentioning that the cup they were drinking out of\r\nwas three years older than he.\r\n\r\nWhile the cup was being examined, the end of Gabriel Oak\u2019s flute became\r\nvisible over his smock-frock pocket, and Henery Fray exclaimed,\r\n\u201CSurely, shepherd, I seed you blowing into a great flute by now at\r\nCasterbridge?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou did,\u201D said Gabriel, blushing faintly. \u201CI\u2019ve been in great trouble,\r\nneighbours, and was driven to it. I used not to be so poor as I be\r\nnow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever mind, heart!\u201D said Mark Clark. \u201CYou should take it\r\ncareless-like, shepherd, and your time will come. But we could thank ye\r\nfor a tune, if ye bain\u2019t too tired?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNeither drum nor trumpet have I heard since Christmas,\u201D said Jan\r\nCoggan. \u201CCome, raise a tune, Master Oak!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, that I will,\u201D said Gabriel, pulling out his flute and putting it\r\ntogether. \u201CA poor tool, neighbours; but such as I can do ye shall have\r\nand welcome.\u201D\r\n\r\nOak then struck up \u201CJockey to the Fair,\u201D and played that sparkling\r\nmelody three times through, accenting the notes in the third round in a\r\nmost artistic and lively manner by bending his body in small jerks and\r\ntapping with his foot to beat time.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe can blow the flute very well\u2014that \u2019a can,\u201D said a young married\r\nman, who having no individuality worth mentioning was known as \u201CSusan\r\nTall\u2019s husband.\u201D He continued, \u201CI\u2019d as lief as not be able to blow into\r\na flute as well as that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s a clever man, and \u2019tis a true comfort for us to have such a\r\nshepherd,\u201D murmured Joseph Poorgrass, in a soft cadence. \u201CWe ought to\r\nfeel full o\u2019 thanksgiving that he\u2019s not a player of ba\u2019dy songs instead\r\nof these merry tunes; for \u2019twould have been just as easy for God to\r\nhave made the shepherd a loose low man\u2014a man of iniquity, so to speak\r\nit\u2014as what he is. Yes, for our wives\u2019 and daughters\u2019 sakes we should\r\nfeel real thanksgiving.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue, true,\u2014real thanksgiving!\u201D dashed in Mark Clark conclusively, not\r\nfeeling it to be of any consequence to his opinion that he had only\r\nheard about a word and three-quarters of what Joseph had said.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D added Joseph, beginning to feel like a man in the Bible; \u201Cfor\r\nevil do thrive so in these times that ye may be as much deceived in the\r\ncleanest shaved and whitest shirted man as in the raggedest tramp upon\r\nthe turnpike, if I may term it so.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, I can mind yer face now, shepherd,\u201D said Henery Fray, criticising\r\nGabriel with misty eyes as he entered upon his second tune. \u201CYes\u2014now I\r\nsee \u2019ee blowing into the flute I know \u2019ee to be the same man I see play\r\nat Casterbridge, for yer mouth were scrimped up and yer eyes a-staring\r\nout like a strangled man\u2019s\u2014just as they be now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis a pity that playing the flute should make a man look such a\r\nscarecrow,\u201D observed Mr. Mark Clark, with additional criticism of\r\nGabriel\u2019s countenance, the latter person jerking out, with the ghastly\r\ngrimace required by the instrument, the chorus of \u201CDame Durden:\u201D\u2014\r\n\r\n\u2019Twas Moll\u2019 and Bet\u2019, and Doll\u2019 and Kate\u2019,\r\nAnd Dor\u2019-othy Drag\u2019-gle Tail\u2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CI hope you don\u2019t mind that young man\u2019s bad manners in naming your\r\nfeatures?\u201D whispered Joseph to Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot at all,\u201D said Mr. Oak.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor by nature ye be a very handsome man, shepherd,\u201D continued Joseph\r\nPoorgrass, with winning sauvity.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, that ye be, shepard,\u201D said the company.\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you very much,\u201D said Oak, in the modest tone good manners\r\ndemanded, thinking, however, that he would never let Bathsheba see him\r\nplaying the flute; in this resolve showing a discretion equal to that\r\nrelated to its sagacious inventress, the divine Minerva herself.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, when I and my wife were married at Norcombe Church,\u201D said the old\r\nmaltster, not pleased at finding himself left out of the subject, \u201Cwe\r\nwere called the handsomest couple in the neighbourhood\u2014everybody said\r\nso.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDanged if ye bain\u2019t altered now, malter,\u201D said a voice with the vigour\r\nnatural to the enunciation of a remarkably evident truism. It came from\r\nthe old man in the background, whose offensiveness and spiteful ways\r\nwere barely atoned for by the occasional chuckle he contributed to\r\ngeneral laughs.\r\n\r\n\u201CO no, no,\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t ye play no more shepherd\u201D said Susan Tall\u2019s husband, the young\r\nmarried man who had spoken once before. \u201CI must be moving and when\r\nthere\u2019s tunes going on I seem as if hung in wires. If I thought after\r\nI\u2019d left that music was still playing, and I not there, I should be\r\nquite melancholy-like.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s yer hurry then, Laban?\u201D inquired Coggan. \u201CYou used to bide as\r\nlate as the latest.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, ye see, neighbours, I was lately married to a woman, and she\u2019s\r\nmy vocation now, and so ye see\u2014\u201D The young man halted lamely.\r\n\r\n\u201CNew Lords new laws, as the saying is, I suppose,\u201D remarked Coggan.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, \u2019a b\u2019lieve\u2014ha, ha!\u201D said Susan Tall\u2019s husband, in a tone intended\r\nto imply his habitual reception of jokes without minding them at all.\r\nThe young man then wished them good-night and withdrew.\r\n\r\nHenery Fray was the first to follow. Then Gabriel arose and went off\r\nwith Jan Coggan, who had offered him a lodging. A few minutes later,\r\nwhen the remaining ones were on their legs and about to depart, Fray\r\ncame back again in a hurry. Flourishing his finger ominously he threw a\r\ngaze teeming with tidings just where his eye alighted by accident,\r\nwhich happened to be in Joseph Poorgrass\u2019s face.\r\n\r\n\u201CO\u2014what\u2019s the matter, what\u2019s the matter, Henery?\u201D said Joseph, starting\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s a-brewing, Henery?\u201D asked Jacob and Mark Clark.\r\n\r\n\u201CBaily Pennyways\u2014Baily Pennyways\u2014I said so; yes, I said so!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat, found out stealing anything?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CStealing it is. The news is, that after Miss Everdene got home she\r\nwent out again to see all was safe, as she usually do, and coming in\r\nfound Baily Pennyways creeping down the granary steps with half a\r\nbushel of barley. She fleed at him like a cat\u2014never such a tomboy as\r\nshe is\u2014of course I speak with closed doors?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou do\u2014you do, Henery.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe fleed at him, and, to cut a long story short, he owned to having\r\ncarried off five sack altogether, upon her promising not to persecute\r\nhim. Well, he\u2019s turned out neck and crop, and my question is, who\u2019s\r\ngoing to be baily now?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe question was such a profound one that Henery was obliged to drink\r\nthere and then from the large cup till the bottom was distinctly\r\nvisible inside. Before he had replaced it on the table, in came the\r\nyoung man, Susan Tall\u2019s husband, in a still greater hurry.\r\n\r\n\u201CHave ye heard the news that\u2019s all over parish?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAbout Baily Pennyways?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut besides that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo\u2014not a morsel of it!\u201D they replied, looking into the very midst of\r\nLaban Tall as if to meet his words half-way down his throat.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a night of horrors!\u201D murmured Joseph Poorgrass, waving his hands\r\nspasmodically. \u201CI\u2019ve had the news-bell ringing in my left ear quite bad\r\nenough for a murder, and I\u2019ve seen a magpie all alone!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFanny Robin\u2014Miss Everdene\u2019s youngest servant\u2014can\u2019t be found. They\u2019ve\r\nbeen wanting to lock up the door these two hours, but she isn\u2019t come\r\nin. And they don\u2019t know what to do about going to bed for fear of\r\nlocking her out. They wouldn\u2019t be so concerned if she hadn\u2019t been\r\nnoticed in such low spirits these last few days, and Maryann d\u2019 think\r\nthe beginning of a crowner\u2019s inquest has happened to the poor girl.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh\u2014\u2019tis burned\u2014\u2019tis burned!\u201D came from Joseph Poorgrass\u2019s dry lips.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo\u2014\u2019tis drowned!\u201D said Tall.\r\n\r\n\u201COr \u2019tis her father\u2019s razor!\u201D suggested Billy Smallbury, with a vivid\r\nsense of detail.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell\u2014Miss Everdene wants to speak to one or two of us before we go to\r\nbed. What with this trouble about the baily, and now about the girl,\r\nmis\u2019ess is almost wild.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey all hastened up the lane to the farmhouse, excepting the old\r\nmaltster, whom neither news, fire, rain, nor thunder could draw from\r\nhis hole. There, as the others\u2019 footsteps died away he sat down again\r\nand continued gazing as usual into the furnace with his red, bleared\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nFrom the bedroom window above their heads Bathsheba\u2019s head and\r\nshoulders, robed in mystic white, were dimly seen extended into the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre any of my men among you?\u201D she said anxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, ma\u2019am, several,\u201D said Susan Tall\u2019s husband.\r\n\r\n\u201CTo-morrow morning I wish two or three of you to make inquiries in the\r\nvillages round if they have seen such a person as Fanny Robin. Do it\r\nquietly; there is no reason for alarm as yet. She must have left whilst\r\nwe were all at the fire.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI beg yer pardon, but had she any young man courting her in the\r\nparish, ma\u2019am?\u201D asked Jacob Smallbury.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve never heard of any such thing, ma\u2019am,\u201D said two or three.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is hardly likely, either,\u201D continued Bathsheba. \u201CFor any lover of\r\nhers might have come to the house if he had been a respectable lad. The\r\nmost mysterious matter connected with her absence\u2014indeed, the only\r\nthing which gives me serious alarm\u2014is that she was seen to go out of\r\nthe house by Maryann with only her indoor working gown on\u2014not even a\r\nbonnet.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you mean, ma\u2019am, excusing my words, that a young woman would\r\nhardly go to see her young man without dressing up,\u201D said Jacob,\r\nturning his mental vision upon past experiences. \u201CThat\u2019s true\u2014she would\r\nnot, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe had, I think, a bundle, though I couldn\u2019t see very well,\u201D said a\r\nfemale voice from another window, which seemed that of Maryann. \u201CBut\r\nshe had no young man about here. Hers lives in Casterbridge, and I\r\nbelieve he\u2019s a soldier.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know his name?\u201D Bathsheba said.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, mistress; she was very close about it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps I might be able to find out if I went to Casterbridge\r\nbarracks,\u201D said William Smallbury.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well; if she doesn\u2019t return to-morrow, mind you go there and try\r\nto discover which man it is, and see him. I feel more responsible than\r\nI should if she had had any friends or relations alive. I do hope she\r\nhas come to no harm through a man of that kind.... And then there\u2019s\r\nthis disgraceful affair of the bailiff\u2014but I can\u2019t speak of him now.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba had so many reasons for uneasiness that it seemed she did not\r\nthink it worth while to dwell upon any particular one. \u201CDo as I told\r\nyou, then,\u201D she said in conclusion, closing the casement.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, ay, mistress; we will,\u201D they replied, and moved away.\r\n\r\nThat night at Coggan\u2019s, Gabriel Oak, beneath the screen of closed\r\neyelids, was busy with fancies, and full of movement, like a river\r\nflowing rapidly under its ice. Night had always been the time at which\r\nhe saw Bathsheba most vividly, and through the slow hours of shadow he\r\ntenderly regarded her image now. It is rarely that the pleasures of the\r\nimagination will compensate for the pain of sleeplessness, but they\r\npossibly did with Oak to-night, for the delight of merely seeing her\r\neffaced for the time his perception of the great difference between\r\nseeing and possessing.\r\n\r\nHe also thought of plans for fetching his few utensils and books from\r\nNorcombe. _The Young Man\u2019s Best Companion_, _The Farrier\u2019s Sure Guide_,\r\n_The Veterinary Surgeon_, _Paradise Lost_, _The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress_,\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_, Ash\u2019s _Dictionary_, and Walkingame\u2019s _Arithmetic_,\r\nconstituted his library; and though a limited series, it was one from\r\nwhich he had acquired more sound information by diligent perusal than\r\nmany a man of opportunities has done from a furlong of laden shelves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nTHE HOMESTEAD\u2014A VISITOR\u2014HALF-CONFIDENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nBy daylight, the bower of Oak\u2019s new-found mistress, Bathsheba Everdene,\r\npresented itself as a hoary building, of the early stage of Classic\r\nRenaissance as regards its architecture, and of a proportion which told\r\nat a glance that, as is so frequently the case, it had once been the\r\nmemorial hall upon a small estate around it, now altogether effaced as\r\na distinct property, and merged in the vast tract of a non-resident\r\nlandlord, which comprised several such modest demesnes.\r\n\r\nFluted pilasters, worked from the solid stone, decorated its front, and\r\nabove the roof the chimneys were panelled or columnar, some coped\r\ngables with finials and like features still retaining traces of their\r\nGothic extraction. Soft brown mosses, like faded velveteen, formed\r\ncushions upon the stone tiling, and tufts of the houseleek or sengreen\r\nsprouted from the eaves of the low surrounding buildings. A gravel walk\r\nleading from the door to the road in front was encrusted at the sides\r\nwith more moss\u2014here it was a silver-green variety, the nut-brown of the\r\ngravel being visible to the width of only a foot or two in the centre.\r\nThis circumstance, and the generally sleepy air of the whole prospect\r\nhere, together with the animated and contrasting state of the reverse\r\nfa\u00E7ade, suggested to the imagination that on the adaptation of the\r\nbuilding for farming purposes the vital principle of the house had\r\nturned round inside its body to face the other way. Reversals of this\r\nkind, strange deformities, tremendous paralyses, are often seen to be\r\ninflicted by trade upon edifices\u2014either individual or in the aggregate\r\nas streets and towns\u2014which were originally planned for pleasure alone.\r\n\r\nLively voices were heard this morning in the upper rooms, the main\r\nstaircase to which was of hard oak, the balusters, heavy as bed-posts,\r\nbeing turned and moulded in the quaint fashion of their century, the\r\nhandrail as stout as a parapet-top, and the stairs themselves\r\ncontinually twisting round like a person trying to look over his\r\nshoulder. Going up, the floors above were found to have a very\r\nirregular surface, rising to ridges, sinking into valleys; and being\r\njust then uncarpeted, the face of the boards was seen to be eaten into\r\ninnumerable vermiculations. Every window replied by a clang to the\r\nopening and shutting of every door, a tremble followed every bustling\r\nmovement, and a creak accompanied a walker about the house, like a\r\nspirit, wherever he went.\r\n\r\nIn the room from which the conversation proceeded Bathsheba and her\r\nservant-companion, Liddy Smallbury, were to be discovered sitting upon\r\nthe floor, and sorting a complication of papers, books, bottles, and\r\nrubbish spread out thereon\u2014remnants from the household stores of the\r\nlate occupier. Liddy, the maltster\u2019s great-granddaughter, was about\r\nBathsheba\u2019s equal in age, and her face was a prominent advertisement of\r\nthe light-hearted English country girl. The beauty her features might\r\nhave lacked in form was amply made up for by perfection of hue, which\r\nat this winter-time was the softened ruddiness on a surface of high\r\nrotundity that we meet with in a Terburg or a Gerard Douw; and, like\r\nthe presentations of those great colourists, it was a face which kept\r\nwell back from the boundary between comeliness and the ideal. Though\r\nelastic in nature she was less daring than Bathsheba, and occasionally\r\nshowed some earnestness, which consisted half of genuine feeling, and\r\nhalf of mannerliness superadded by way of duty.\r\n\r\nThrough a partly-opened door the noise of a scrubbing-brush led up to\r\nthe charwoman, Maryann Money, a person who for a face had a circular\r\ndisc, furrowed less by age than by long gazes of perplexity at distant\r\nobjects. To think of her was to get good-humoured; to speak of her was\r\nto raise the image of a dried Normandy pippin.\r\n\r\n\u201CStop your scrubbing a moment,\u201D said Bathsheba through the door to her.\r\n\u201CI hear something.\u201D\r\n\r\nMaryann suspended the brush.\r\n\r\nThe tramp of a horse was apparent, approaching the front of the\r\nbuilding. The paces slackened, turned in at the wicket, and, what was\r\nmost unusual, came up the mossy path close to the door. The door was\r\ntapped with the end of a crop or stick.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat impertinence!\u201D said Liddy, in a low voice. \u201CTo ride up the\r\nfootpath like that! Why didn\u2019t he stop at the gate? Lord! \u2019Tis a\r\ngentleman! I see the top of his hat.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBe quiet!\u201D said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nThe further expression of Liddy\u2019s concern was continued by aspect\r\ninstead of narrative.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy doesn\u2019t Mrs. Coggan go to the door?\u201D Bathsheba continued.\r\n\r\nRat-tat-tat-tat resounded more decisively from Bathsheba\u2019s oak.\r\n\r\n\u201CMaryann, you go!\u201D said she, fluttering under the onset of a crowd of\r\nromantic possibilities.\r\n\r\n\u201COh ma\u2019am\u2014see, here\u2019s a mess!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe argument was unanswerable after a glance at Maryann.\r\n\r\n\u201CLiddy\u2014you must,\u201D said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nLiddy held up her hands and arms, coated with dust from the rubbish\r\nthey were sorting, and looked imploringly at her mistress.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2014Mrs. Coggan is going!\u201D said Bathsheba, exhaling her relief in\r\nthe form of a long breath which had lain in her bosom a minute or more.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and a deep voice said\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CIs Miss Everdene at home?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll see, sir,\u201D said Mrs. Coggan, and in a minute appeared in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\u201CDear, what a thirtover place this world is!\u201D continued Mrs. Coggan (a\r\nwholesome-looking lady who had a voice for each class of remark\r\naccording to the emotion involved; who could toss a pancake or twirl a\r\nmop with the accuracy of pure mathematics, and who at this moment\r\nshowed hands shaggy with fragments of dough and arms encrusted with\r\nflour). \u201CI am never up to my elbows, Miss, in making a pudding but one\r\nof two things do happen\u2014either my nose must needs begin tickling, and I\r\ncan\u2019t live without scratching it, or somebody knocks at the door.\r\nHere\u2019s Mr. Boldwood wanting to see you, Miss Everdene.\u201D\r\n\r\nA woman\u2019s dress being a part of her countenance, and any disorder in\r\nthe one being of the same nature with a malformation or wound in the\r\nother, Bathsheba said at once\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t see him in this state. Whatever shall I do?\u201D\r\n\r\nNot-at-homes were hardly naturalized in Weatherbury farmhouses, so\r\nLiddy suggested\u2014\u201CSay you\u2019re a fright with dust, and can\u2019t come down.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014that sounds very well,\u201D said Mrs. Coggan, critically.\r\n\r\n\u201CSay I can\u2019t see him\u2014that will do.\u201D\r\n\r\nMrs. Coggan went downstairs, and returned the answer as requested,\r\nadding, however, on her own responsibility, \u201CMiss is dusting bottles,\r\nsir, and is quite a object\u2014that\u2019s why \u2019tis.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, very well,\u201D said the deep voice indifferently. \u201CAll I wanted to\r\nask was, if anything had been heard of Fanny Robin?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNothing, sir\u2014but we may know to-night. William Smallbury is gone to\r\nCasterbridge, where her young man lives, as is supposed, and the other\r\nmen be inquiring about everywhere.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe horse\u2019s tramp then recommenced and retreated, and the door closed.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho is Mr. Boldwood?\u201D said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\u201CA gentleman-farmer at Little Weatherbury.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMarried?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, miss.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow old is he?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CForty, I should say\u2014very handsome\u2014rather stern-looking\u2014and rich.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a bother this dusting is! I am always in some unfortunate plight\r\nor other,\u201D Bathsheba said, complainingly. \u201CWhy should he inquire about\r\nFanny?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, because, as she had no friends in her childhood, he took her and\r\nput her to school, and got her her place here under your uncle. He\u2019s a\r\nvery kind man that way, but Lord\u2014there!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever was such a hopeless man for a woman! He\u2019s been courted by sixes\r\nand sevens\u2014all the girls, gentle and simple, for miles round, have\r\ntried him. Jane Perkins worked at him for two months like a slave, and\r\nthe two Miss Taylors spent a year upon him, and he cost Farmer Ives\u2019s\r\ndaughter nights of tears and twenty pounds\u2019 worth of new clothes; but\r\nLord\u2014the money might as well have been thrown out of the window.\u201D\r\n\r\nA little boy came up at this moment and looked in upon them. This child\r\nwas one of the Coggans, who, with the Smallburys, were as common among\r\nthe families of this district as the Avons and Derwents among our\r\nrivers. He always had a loosened tooth or a cut finger to show to\r\nparticular friends, which he did with an air of being thereby elevated\r\nabove the common herd of afflictionless humanity\u2014to which exhibition\r\npeople were expected to say \u201CPoor child!\u201D with a dash of congratulation\r\nas well as pity.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve got a pen-nee!\u201D said Master Coggan in a scanning measure.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell\u2014who gave it you, Teddy?\u201D said Liddy.\r\n\r\n\u201CMis-terr Bold-wood! He gave it to me for opening the gate.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat did he say?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe said, \u2018Where are you going, my little man?\u2019 and I said, \u2018To Miss\r\nEverdene\u2019s please,\u2019 and he said, \u2018She is a staid woman, isn\u2019t she, my\r\nlittle man?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou naughty child! What did you say that for?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Cause he gave me the penny!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a pucker everything is in!\u201D said Bathsheba, discontentedly when\r\nthe child had gone. \u201CGet away, Maryann, or go on with your scrubbing,\r\nor do something! You ought to be married by this time, and not here\r\ntroubling me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, mistress\u2014so I did. But what between the poor men I won\u2019t have, and\r\nthe rich men who won\u2019t have me, I stand as a pelican in the\r\nwilderness!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDid anybody ever want to marry you miss?\u201D Liddy ventured to ask when\r\nthey were again alone. \u201CLots of \u2019em, I daresay?\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba paused, as if about to refuse a reply, but the temptation to\r\nsay yes, since it was really in her power was irresistible by aspiring\r\nvirginity, in spite of her spleen at having been published as old.\r\n\r\n\u201CA man wanted to once,\u201D she said, in a highly experienced tone, and the\r\nimage of Gabriel Oak, as the farmer, rose before her.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow nice it must seem!\u201D said Liddy, with the fixed features of mental\r\nrealization. \u201CAnd you wouldn\u2019t have him?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe wasn\u2019t quite good enough for me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow sweet to be able to disdain, when most of us are glad to say,\r\n\u2018Thank you!\u2019 I seem I hear it. \u2018No, sir\u2014I\u2019m your better.\u2019 or \u2018Kiss my\r\nfoot, sir; my face is for mouths of consequence.\u2019 And did you love him,\r\nmiss?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, no. But I rather liked him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you now?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf course not\u2014what footsteps are those I hear?\u201D\r\n\r\nLiddy looked from a back window into the courtyard behind, which was\r\nnow getting low-toned and dim with the earliest films of night. A\r\ncrooked file of men was approaching the back door. The whole string of\r\ntrailing individuals advanced in the completest balance of intention,\r\nlike the remarkable creatures known as Chain Salp\u00E6, which, distinctly\r\norganized in other respects, have one will common to a whole family.\r\nSome were, as usual, in snow-white smock-frocks of Russia duck, and\r\nsome in whitey-brown ones of drabbet\u2014marked on the wrists, breasts,\r\nbacks, and sleeves with honeycomb-work. Two or three women in pattens\r\nbrought up the rear.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Philistines be upon us,\u201D said Liddy, making her nose white against\r\nthe glass.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, very well. Maryann, go down and keep them in the kitchen till I am\r\ndressed, and then show them in to me in the hall.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nMISTRESS AND MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour later Bathsheba, in finished dress, and followed by Liddy,\r\nentered the upper end of the old hall to find that her men had all\r\ndeposited themselves on a long form and a settle at the lower\r\nextremity. She sat down at a table and opened the time-book, pen in her\r\nhand, with a canvas money-bag beside her. From this she poured a small\r\nheap of coin. Liddy chose a position at her elbow and began to sew,\r\nsometimes pausing and looking round, or, with the air of a privileged\r\nperson, taking up one of the half-sovereigns lying before her and\r\nsurveying it merely as a work of art, while strictly preventing her\r\ncountenance from expressing any wish to possess it as money.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow before I begin, men,\u201D said Bathsheba, \u201CI have two matters to speak\r\nof. The first is that the bailiff is dismissed for thieving, and that I\r\nhave formed a resolution to have no bailiff at all, but to manage\r\neverything with my own head and hands.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe men breathed an audible breath of amazement.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe next matter is, have you heard anything of Fanny?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNothing, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you done anything?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI met Farmer Boldwood,\u201D said Jacob Smallbury, \u201Cand I went with him and\r\ntwo of his men, and dragged Newmill Pond, but we found nothing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd the new shepherd have been to Buck\u2019s Head, by Yalbury, thinking\r\nshe had gone there, but nobody had seed her,\u201D said Laban Tall.\r\n\r\n\u201CHasn\u2019t William Smallbury been to Casterbridge?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, ma\u2019am, but he\u2019s not yet come home. He promised to be back by\r\nsix.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt wants a quarter to six at present,\u201D said Bathsheba, looking at her\r\nwatch. \u201CI daresay he\u2019ll be in directly. Well, now then\u201D\u2014she looked into\r\nthe book\u2014\u201CJoseph Poorgrass, are you there?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, sir\u2014ma\u2019am I mane,\u201D said the person addressed. \u201CI be the personal\r\nname of Poorgrass.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what are you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNothing in my own eye. In the eye of other people\u2014well, I don\u2019t say\r\nit; though public thought will out.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you do on the farm?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do do carting things all the year, and in seed time I shoots the\r\nrooks and sparrows, and helps at pig-killing, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow much to you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPlease nine and ninepence and a good halfpenny where \u2019twas a bad one,\r\nsir\u2014ma\u2019am I mane.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CQuite correct. Now here are ten shillings in addition as a small\r\npresent, as I am a new comer.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba blushed slightly at the sense of being generous in public,\r\nand Henery Fray, who had drawn up towards her chair, lifted his\r\neyebrows and fingers to express amazement on a small scale.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow much do I owe you\u2014that man in the corner\u2014what\u2019s your name?\u201D\r\ncontinued Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\u201CMatthew Moon, ma\u2019am,\u201D said a singular framework of clothes with\r\nnothing of any consequence inside them, which advanced with the toes in\r\nno definite direction forwards, but turned in or out as they chanced to\r\nswing.\r\n\r\n\u201CMatthew Mark, did you say?\u2014speak out\u2014I shall not hurt you,\u201D inquired\r\nthe young farmer, kindly.\r\n\r\n\u201CMatthew Moon, mem,\u201D said Henery Fray, correctingly, from behind her\r\nchair, to which point he had edged himself.\r\n\r\n\u201CMatthew Moon,\u201D murmured Bathsheba, turning her bright eyes to the\r\nbook. \u201CTen and twopence halfpenny is the sum put down to you, I see?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, mis\u2019ess,\u201D said Matthew, as the rustle of wind among dead leaves.\r\n\r\n\u201CHere it is, and ten shillings. Now the next\u2014Andrew Randle, you are a\r\nnew man, I hear. How come you to leave your last farm?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CP-p-p-p-p-pl-pl-pl-pl-l-l-l-l-ease, ma\u2019am, p-p-p-p-pl-pl-\r\npl-pl-please, ma\u2019am-please\u2019m-please\u2019m\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019A\u2019s a stammering man, mem,\u201D said Henery Fray in an undertone, \u201Cand\r\nthey turned him away because the only time he ever did speak plain he\r\nsaid his soul was his own, and other iniquities, to the squire. \u2019A can\r\ncuss, mem, as well as you or I, but \u2019a can\u2019t speak a common speech to\r\nsave his life.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAndrew Randle, here\u2019s yours\u2014finish thanking me in a day or two.\r\nTemperance Miller\u2014oh, here\u2019s another, Soberness\u2014both women I suppose?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2019m. Here we be, \u2019a b\u2019lieve,\u201D was echoed in shrill unison.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat have you been doing?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTending thrashing-machine and wimbling haybonds, and saying \u2018Hoosh!\u2019\r\nto the cocks and hens when they go upon your seeds, and planting Early\r\nFlourballs and Thompson\u2019s Wonderfuls with a dibble.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014I see. Are they satisfactory women?\u201D she inquired softly of Henery\r\nFray.\r\n\r\n\u201COh mem\u2014don\u2019t ask me! Yielding women\u2014as scarlet a pair as ever was!\u201D\r\ngroaned Henery under his breath.\r\n\r\n\u201CSit down.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho, mem?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSit down.\u201D\r\n\r\nJoseph Poorgrass, in the background twitched, and his lips became dry\r\nwith fear of some terrible consequences, as he saw Bathsheba summarily\r\nspeaking, and Henery slinking off to a corner.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow the next. Laban Tall, you\u2019ll stay on working for me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFor you or anybody that pays me well, ma\u2019am,\u201D replied the young\r\nmarried man.\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue\u2014the man must live!\u201D said a woman in the back quarter, who had\r\njust entered with clicking pattens.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat woman is that?\u201D Bathsheba asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CI be his lawful wife!\u201D continued the voice with greater prominence of\r\nmanner and tone. This lady called herself five-and-twenty, looked\r\nthirty, passed as thirty-five, and was forty. She was a woman who\r\nnever, like some newly married, showed conjugal tenderness in public,\r\nperhaps because she had none to show.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, you are,\u201D said Bathsheba. \u201CWell, Laban, will you stay on?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, he\u2019ll stay, ma\u2019am!\u201D said again the shrill tongue of Laban\u2019s\r\nlawful wife.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, he can speak for himself, I suppose.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh Lord, not he, ma\u2019am! A simple tool. Well enough, but a poor\r\ngawkhammer mortal,\u201D the wife replied.\r\n\r\n\u201CHeh-heh-heh!\u201D laughed the married man with a hideous effort of\r\nappreciation, for he was as irrepressibly good-humoured under ghastly\r\nsnubs as a parliamentary candidate on the hustings.\r\n\r\nThe names remaining were called in the same manner.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow I think I have done with you,\u201D said Bathsheba, closing the book\r\nand shaking back a stray twine of hair. \u201CHas William Smallbury\r\nreturned?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe new shepherd will want a man under him,\u201D suggested Henery Fray,\r\ntrying to make himself official again by a sideway approach towards her\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\u201COh\u2014he will. Who can he have?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYoung Cain Ball is a very good lad,\u201D Henery said, \u201Cand Shepherd Oak\r\ndon\u2019t mind his youth?\u201D he added, turning with an apologetic smile to\r\nthe shepherd, who had just appeared on the scene, and was now leaning\r\nagainst the doorpost with his arms folded.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, I don\u2019t mind that,\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow did Cain come by such a name?\u201D asked Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\u201COh you see, mem, his pore mother, not being a Scripture-read woman,\r\nmade a mistake at his christening, thinking \u2019twas Abel killed Cain, and\r\ncalled en Cain, meaning Abel all the time. The parson put it right, but\r\n\u2019twas too late, for the name could never be got rid of in the parish.\r\n\u2019Tis very unfortunate for the boy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is rather unfortunate.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. However, we soften it down as much as we can, and call him Cainy.\r\nAh, pore widow-woman! she cried her heart out about it almost. She was\r\nbrought up by a very heathen father and mother, who never sent her to\r\nchurch or school, and it shows how the sins of the parents are visited\r\nupon the children, mem.\u201D\r\n\r\nMr. Fray here drew up his features to the mild degree of melancholy\r\nrequired when the persons involved in the given misfortune do not\r\nbelong to your own family.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well then, Cainey Ball to be under-shepherd. And you quite\r\nunderstand your duties?\u2014you I mean, Gabriel Oak?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CQuite well, I thank you, Miss Everdene,\u201D said Shepherd Oak from the\r\ndoorpost. \u201CIf I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll inquire.\u201D Gabriel was rather staggered by\r\nthe remarkable coolness of her manner. Certainly nobody without\r\nprevious information would have dreamt that Oak and the handsome woman\r\nbefore whom he stood had ever been other than strangers. But perhaps\r\nher air was the inevitable result of the social rise which had advanced\r\nher from a cottage to a large house and fields. The case is not\r\nunexampled in high places. When, in the writings of the later poets,\r\nJove and his family are found to have moved from their cramped quarters\r\non the peak of Olympus into the wide sky above it, their words show a\r\nproportionate increase of arrogance and reserve.\r\n\r\nFootsteps were heard in the passage, combining in their character the\r\nqualities both of weight and measure, rather at the expense of\r\nvelocity.\r\n\r\n(All.) \u201CHere\u2019s Billy Smallbury come from Casterbridge.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what\u2019s the news?\u201D said Bathsheba, as William, after marching to\r\nthe middle of the hall, took a handkerchief from his hat and wiped his\r\nforehead from its centre to its remoter boundaries.\r\n\r\n\u201CI should have been sooner, miss,\u201D he said, \u201Cif it hadn\u2019t been for the\r\nweather.\u201D He then stamped with each foot severely, and on looking down\r\nhis boots were perceived to be clogged with snow.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome at last, is it?\u201D said Henery.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, what about Fanny?\u201D said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, ma\u2019am, in round numbers, she\u2019s run away with the soldiers,\u201D said\r\nWilliam.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; not a steady girl like Fanny!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll tell ye all particulars. When I got to Casterbridge Barracks,\r\nthey said, \u2018The Eleventh Dragoon-Guards be gone away, and new troops\r\nhave come.\u2019 The Eleventh left last week for Melchester and onwards. The\r\nRoute came from Government like a thief in the night, as is his nature\r\nto, and afore the Eleventh knew it almost, they were on the march. They\r\npassed near here.\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel had listened with interest. \u201CI saw them go,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D continued William, \u201Cthey pranced down the street playing \u2018The\r\nGirl I Left Behind Me,\u2019 so \u2019tis said, in glorious notes of triumph.\r\nEvery looker-on\u2019s inside shook with the blows of the great drum to his\r\ndeepest vitals, and there was not a dry eye throughout the town among\r\nthe public-house people and the nameless women!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut they\u2019re not gone to any war?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, ma\u2019am; but they be gone to take the places of them who may, which\r\nis very close connected. And so I said to myself, Fanny\u2019s young man was\r\none of the regiment, and she\u2019s gone after him. There, ma\u2019am, that\u2019s it\r\nin black and white.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you find out his name?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; nobody knew it. I believe he was higher in rank than a private.\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel remained musing and said nothing, for he was in doubt.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, we are not likely to know more to-night, at any rate,\u201D said\r\nBathsheba. \u201CBut one of you had better run across to Farmer Boldwood\u2019s\r\nand tell him that much.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe then rose; but before retiring, addressed a few words to them with\r\na pretty dignity, to which her mourning dress added a soberness that\r\nwas hardly to be found in the words themselves.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow mind, you have a mistress instead of a master. I don\u2019t yet know my\r\npowers or my talents in farming; but I shall do my best, and if you\r\nserve me well, so shall I serve you. Don\u2019t any unfair ones among you\r\n(if there are any such, but I hope not) suppose that because I\u2019m a\r\nwoman I don\u2019t understand the difference between bad goings-on and\r\ngood.\u201D\r\n\r\n(All.) \u201CNo\u2019m!\u201D\r\n\r\n(Liddy.) \u201CExcellent well said.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI shall be up before you are awake; I shall be afield before you are\r\nup; and I shall have breakfasted before you are afield. In short, I\r\nshall astonish you all.\u201D\r\n\r\n(All.) \u201CYes\u2019m!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd so good-night.\u201D\r\n\r\n(All.) \u201CGood-night, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen this small thesmothete stepped from the table, and surged out of\r\nthe hall, her black silk dress licking up a few straws and dragging\r\nthem along with a scratching noise upon the floor. Liddy, elevating her\r\nfeelings to the occasion from a sense of grandeur, floated off behind\r\nBathsheba with a milder dignity not entirely free from travesty, and\r\nthe door was closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nOUTSIDE THE BARRACKS\u2014SNOW\u2014A MEETING\r\n\r\n\r\nFor dreariness nothing could surpass a prospect in the outskirts of a\r\ncertain town and military station, many miles north of Weatherbury, at\r\na later hour on this same snowy evening\u2014if that may be called a\r\nprospect of which the chief constituent was darkness.\r\n\r\nIt was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing\r\nany great sense of incongruity: when, with impressible persons, love\r\nbecomes solicitousness, hope sinks to misgiving, and faith to hope:\r\nwhen the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at\r\nopportunities for ambition that have been passed by, and anticipation\r\ndoes not prompt to enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe scene was a public path, bordered on the left hand by a river,\r\nbehind which rose a high wall. On the right was a tract of land, partly\r\nmeadow and partly moor, reaching, at its remote verge, to a wide\r\nundulating upland.\r\n\r\nThe changes of the seasons are less obtrusive on spots of this kind\r\nthan amid woodland scenery. Still, to a close observer, they are just\r\nas perceptible; the difference is that their media of manifestation are\r\nless trite and familiar than such well-known ones as the bursting of\r\nthe buds or the fall of the leaf. Many are not so stealthy and gradual\r\nas we may be apt to imagine in considering the general torpidity of a\r\nmoor or waste. Winter, in coming to the country hereabout, advanced in\r\nwell-marked stages, wherein might have been successively observed the\r\nretreat of the snakes, the transformation of the ferns, the filling of\r\nthe pools, a rising of fogs, the embrowning by frost, the collapse of\r\nthe fungi, and an obliteration by snow.\r\n\r\nThis climax of the series had been reached to-night on the aforesaid\r\nmoor, and for the first time in the season its irregularities were\r\nforms without features; suggestive of anything, proclaiming nothing,\r\nand without more character than that of being the limit of something\r\nelse\u2014the lowest layer of a firmament of snow. From this chaotic skyful\r\nof crowding flakes the mead and moor momentarily received additional\r\nclothing, only to appear momentarily more naked thereby. The vast arch\r\nof cloud above was strangely low, and formed as it were the roof of a\r\nlarge dark cavern, gradually sinking in upon its floor; for the\r\ninstinctive thought was that the snow lining the heavens and that\r\nencrusting the earth would soon unite into one mass without any\r\nintervening stratum of air at all.\r\n\r\nWe turn our attention to the left-hand characteristics; which were\r\nflatness in respect of the river, verticality in respect of the wall\r\nbehind it, and darkness as to both. These features made up the mass. If\r\nanything could be darker than the sky, it was the wall, and if any\r\nthing could be gloomier than the wall it was the river beneath. The\r\nindistinct summit of the fa\u00E7ade was notched and pronged by chimneys\r\nhere and there, and upon its face were faintly signified the oblong\r\nshapes of windows, though only in the upper part. Below, down to the\r\nwater\u2019s edge, the flat was unbroken by hole or projection.\r\n\r\nAn indescribable succession of dull blows, perplexing in their\r\nregularity, sent their sound with difficulty through the fluffy\r\natmosphere. It was a neighbouring clock striking ten. The bell was in\r\nthe open air, and being overlaid with several inches of muffling snow,\r\nhad lost its voice for the time.\r\n\r\nAbout this hour the snow abated: ten flakes fell where twenty had\r\nfallen, then one had the room of ten. Not long after a form moved by\r\nthe brink of the river.\r\n\r\nBy its outline upon the colourless background, a close observer might\r\nhave seen that it was small. This was all that was positively\r\ndiscoverable, though it seemed human.\r\n\r\nThe shape went slowly along, but without much exertion, for the snow,\r\nthough sudden, was not as yet more than two inches deep. At this time\r\nsome words were spoken aloud:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201COne. Two. Three. Four. Five.\u201D\r\n\r\nBetween each utterance the little shape advanced about half a dozen\r\nyards. It was evident now that the windows high in the wall were being\r\ncounted. The word \u201CFive\u201D represented the fifth window from the end of\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\nHere the spot stopped, and dwindled smaller. The figure was stooping.\r\nThen a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the fifth window.\r\nIt smacked against the wall at a point several yards from its mark. The\r\nthrow was the idea of a man conjoined with the execution of a woman. No\r\nman who had ever seen bird, rabbit, or squirrel in his childhood, could\r\npossibly have thrown with such utter imbecility as was shown here.\r\n\r\nAnother attempt, and another; till by degrees the wall must have become\r\npimpled with the adhering lumps of snow. At last one fragment struck\r\nthe fifth window.\r\n\r\nThe river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort\r\nwhich races middle and sides with the same gliding precision, any\r\nirregularities of speed being immediately corrected by a small\r\nwhirlpool. Nothing was heard in reply to the signal but the gurgle and\r\ncluck of one of these invisible wheels\u2014together with a few small sounds\r\nwhich a sad man would have called moans, and a happy man\r\nlaughter\u2014caused by the flapping of the waters against trifling objects\r\nin other parts of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe window was struck again in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThen a noise was heard, apparently produced by the opening of the\r\nwindow. This was followed by a voice from the same quarter.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho\u2019s there?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe tones were masculine, and not those of surprise. The high wall\r\nbeing that of a barrack, and marriage being looked upon with disfavour\r\nin the army, assignations and communications had probably been made\r\nacross the river before to-night.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs it Sergeant Troy?\u201D said the blurred spot in the snow, tremulously.\r\n\r\nThis person was so much like a mere shade upon the earth, and the other\r\nspeaker so much a part of the building, that one would have said the\r\nwall was holding a conversation with the snow.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D came suspiciously from the shadow. \u201CWhat girl are you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Frank\u2014don\u2019t you know me?\u201D said the spot. \u201CYour wife, Fanny Robin.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFanny!\u201D said the wall, in utter astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said the girl, with a half-suppressed gasp of emotion.\r\n\r\nThere was something in the woman\u2019s tone which is not that of the wife,\r\nand there was a manner in the man which is rarely a husband\u2019s. The\r\ndialogue went on:\r\n\r\n\u201CHow did you come here?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI asked which was your window. Forgive me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI did not expect you to-night. Indeed, I did not think you would come\r\nat all. It was a wonder you found me here. I am orderly to-morrow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou said I was to come.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell\u2014I said that you might.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I mean that I might. You are glad to see me, Frank?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh yes\u2014of course.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCan you\u2014come to me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy dear Fan, no! The bugle has sounded, the barrack gates are closed,\r\nand I have no leave. We are all of us as good as in the county gaol\r\ntill to-morrow morning.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen I shan\u2019t see you till then!\u201D The words were in a faltering tone\r\nof disappointment.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow did you get here from Weatherbury?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI walked\u2014some part of the way\u2014the rest by the carriers.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am surprised.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014so am I. And Frank, when will it be?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat you promised.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t quite recollect.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CO you do! Don\u2019t speak like that. It weighs me to the earth. It makes\r\nme say what ought to be said first by you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever mind\u2014say it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CO, must I?\u2014it is, when shall we be married, Frank?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, I see. Well\u2014you have to get proper clothes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have money. Will it be by banns or license?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBanns, I should think.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd we live in two parishes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo we? What then?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy lodgings are in St. Mary\u2019s, and this is not. So they will have to\r\nbe published in both.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that the law?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. O Frank\u2014you think me forward, I am afraid! Don\u2019t, dear Frank\u2014will\r\nyou\u2014for I love you so. And you said lots of times you would marry me,\r\nand\u2014and\u2014I\u2014I\u2014I\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t cry, now! It is foolish. If I said so, of course I will.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd shall I put up the banns in my parish, and will you in yours?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTo-morrow?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot to-morrow. We\u2019ll settle in a few days.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou have the permission of the officers?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, not yet.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CO\u2014how is it? You said you almost had before you left Casterbridge.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe fact is, I forgot to ask. Your coming like this is so sudden and\r\nunexpected.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014yes\u2014it is. It was wrong of me to worry you. I\u2019ll go away now. Will\r\nyou come and see me to-morrow, at Mrs. Twills\u2019s, in North Street? I\r\ndon\u2019t like to come to the Barracks. There are bad women about, and they\r\nthink me one.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CQuite, so. I\u2019ll come to you, my dear. Good-night.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood-night, Frank\u2014good-night!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd the noise was again heard of a window closing. The little spot\r\nmoved away. When she passed the corner a subdued exclamation was heard\r\ninside the wall.\r\n\r\n\u201CHo\u2014ho\u2014Sergeant\u2014ho\u2014ho!\u201D An expostulation followed, but it was\r\nindistinct; and it became lost amid a low peal of laughter, which was\r\nhardly distinguishable from the gurgle of the tiny whirlpools outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nFARMERS\u2014A RULE\u2014AN EXCEPTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first public evidence of Bathsheba\u2019s decision to be a farmer in her\r\nown person and by proxy no more was her appearance the following\r\nmarket-day in the cornmarket at Casterbridge.\r\n\r\nThe low though extensive hall, supported by beams and pillars, and\r\nlatterly dignified by the name of Corn Exchange, was thronged with hot\r\nmen who talked among each other in twos and threes, the speaker of the\r\nminute looking sideways into his auditor\u2019s face and concentrating his\r\nargument by a contraction of one eyelid during delivery. The greater\r\nnumber carried in their hands ground-ash saplings, using them partly as\r\nwalking-sticks and partly for poking up pigs, sheep, neighbours with\r\ntheir backs turned, and restful things in general, which seemed to\r\nrequire such treatment in the course of their peregrinations. During\r\nconversations each subjected his sapling to great varieties of\r\nusage\u2014bending it round his back, forming an arch of it between his two\r\nhands, overweighting it on the ground till it reached nearly a\r\nsemicircle; or perhaps it was hastily tucked under the arm whilst the\r\nsample-bag was pulled forth and a handful of corn poured into the palm,\r\nwhich, after criticism, was flung upon the floor, an issue of events\r\nperfectly well known to half-a-dozen acute town-bred fowls which had as\r\nusual crept into the building unobserved, and waited the fulfilment of\r\ntheir anticipations with a high-stretched neck and oblique eye.\r\n\r\nAmong these heavy yeomen a feminine figure glided, the single one of\r\nher sex that the room contained. She was prettily and even daintily\r\ndressed. She moved between them as a chaise between carts, was heard\r\nafter them as a romance after sermons, was felt among them like a\r\nbreeze among furnaces. It had required a little determination\u2014far more\r\nthan she had at first imagined\u2014to take up a position here, for at her\r\nfirst entry the lumbering dialogues had ceased, nearly every face had\r\nbeen turned towards her, and those that were already turned rigidly\r\nfixed there.\r\n\r\nTwo or three only of the farmers were personally known to Bathsheba,\r\nand to these she had made her way. But if she was to be the practical\r\nwoman she had intended to show herself, business must be carried on,\r\nintroductions or none, and she ultimately acquired confidence enough to\r\nspeak and reply boldly to men merely known to her by hearsay. Bathsheba\r\ntoo had her sample-bags, and by degrees adopted the professional pour\r\ninto the hand\u2014holding up the grains in her narrow palm for inspection,\r\nin perfect Casterbridge manner.\r\n\r\nSomething in the exact arch of her upper unbroken row of teeth, and in\r\nthe keenly pointed corners of her red mouth when, with parted lips, she\r\nsomewhat defiantly turned up her face to argue a point with a tall man,\r\nsuggested that there was potentiality enough in that lithe slip of\r\nhumanity for alarming exploits of sex, and daring enough to carry them\r\nout. But her eyes had a softness\u2014invariably a softness\u2014which, had they\r\nnot been dark, would have seemed mistiness; as they were, it lowered an\r\nexpression that might have been piercing to simple clearness.\r\n\r\nStrange to say of a woman in full bloom and vigor, she always allowed\r\nher interlocutors to finish their statements before rejoining with\r\nhers. In arguing on prices, she held to her own firmly, as was natural\r\nin a dealer, and reduced theirs persistently, as was inevitable in a\r\nwoman. But there was an elasticity in her firmness which removed it\r\nfrom obstinacy, as there was a _na\u00EFvet\u00E9_ in her cheapening which saved\r\nit from meanness.\r\n\r\nThose of the farmers with whom she had no dealings (by far the greater\r\npart) were continually asking each other, \u201CWho is she?\u201D The reply would\r\nbe\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CFarmer Everdene\u2019s niece; took on Weatherbury Upper Farm; turned away\r\nthe baily, and swears she\u2019ll do everything herself.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe other man would then shake his head.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, \u2019tis a pity she\u2019s so headstrong,\u201D the first would say. \u201CBut we\r\nought to be proud of her here\u2014she lightens up the old place. \u2019Tis such\r\na shapely maid, however, that she\u2019ll soon get picked up.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt would be ungallant to suggest that the novelty of her engagement in\r\nsuch an occupation had almost as much to do with the magnetism as had\r\nthe beauty of her face and movements. However, the interest was\r\ngeneral, and this Saturday\u2019s _d\u00E9but_ in the forum, whatever it may have\r\nbeen to Bathsheba as the buying and selling farmer, was unquestionably\r\na triumph to her as the maiden. Indeed, the sensation was so pronounced\r\nthat her instinct on two or three occasions was merely to walk as a\r\nqueen among these gods of the fallow, like a little sister of a little\r\nJove, and to neglect closing prices altogether.\r\n\r\nThe numerous evidences of her power to attract were only thrown into\r\ngreater relief by a marked exception. Women seem to have eyes in their\r\nribbons for such matters as these. Bathsheba, without looking within a\r\nright angle of him, was conscious of a black sheep among the flock.\r\n\r\nIt perplexed her first. If there had been a respectable minority on\r\neither side, the case would have been most natural. If nobody had\r\nregarded her, she would have taken the matter indifferently\u2014such cases\r\nhad occurred. If everybody, this man included, she would have taken it\r\nas a matter of course\u2014people had done so before. But the smallness of\r\nthe exception made the mystery.\r\n\r\nShe soon knew thus much of the recusant\u2019s appearance. He was a\r\ngentlemanly man, with full and distinctly outlined Roman features, the\r\nprominences of which glowed in the sun with a bronze-like richness of\r\ntone. He was erect in attitude, and quiet in demeanour. One\r\ncharacteristic pre-eminently marked him\u2014dignity.\r\n\r\nApparently he had some time ago reached that entrance to middle age at\r\nwhich a man\u2019s aspect naturally ceases to alter for the term of a dozen\r\nyears or so; and, artificially, a woman\u2019s does likewise. Thirty-five\r\nand fifty were his limits of variation\u2014he might have been either, or\r\nanywhere between the two.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that married men of forty are usually ready and generous\r\nenough to fling passing glances at any specimen of moderate beauty they\r\nmay discern by the way. Probably, as with persons playing whist for\r\nlove, the consciousness of a certain immunity under any circumstances\r\nfrom that worst possible ultimate, the having to pay, makes them unduly\r\nspeculative. Bathsheba was convinced that this unmoved person was not a\r\nmarried man.\r\n\r\nWhen marketing was over, she rushed off to Liddy, who was waiting for\r\nher beside the yellow gig in which they had driven to town. The horse\r\nwas put in, and on they trotted\u2014Bathsheba\u2019s sugar, tea, and drapery\r\nparcels being packed behind, and expressing in some indescribable\r\nmanner, by their colour, shape, and general lineaments, that they were\r\nthat young lady-farmer\u2019s property, and the grocer\u2019s and draper\u2019s no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve been through it, Liddy, and it is over. I shan\u2019t mind it again,\r\nfor they will all have grown accustomed to seeing me there; but this\r\nmorning it was as bad as being married\u2014eyes everywhere!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI knowed it would be,\u201D Liddy said. \u201CMen be such a terrible class of\r\nsociety to look at a body.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut there was one man who had more sense than to waste his time upon\r\nme.\u201D The information was put in this form that Liddy might not for a\r\nmoment suppose her mistress was at all piqued. \u201CA very good-looking\r\nman,\u201D she continued, \u201Cupright; about forty, I should think. Do you know\r\nat all who he could be?\u201D\r\n\r\nLiddy couldn\u2019t think.\r\n\r\n\u201CCan\u2019t you guess at all?\u201D said Bathsheba with some disappointment.\r\n\r\n\u201CI haven\u2019t a notion; besides, \u2019tis no difference, since he took less\r\nnotice of you than any of the rest. Now, if he\u2019d taken more, it would\r\nhave mattered a great deal.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba was suffering from the reverse feeling just then, and they\r\nbowled along in silence. A low carriage, bowling along still more\r\nrapidly behind a horse of unimpeachable breed, overtook and passed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, there he is!\u201D she said.\r\n\r\nLiddy looked. \u201CThat! That\u2019s Farmer Boldwood\u2014of course \u2019tis\u2014the man you\r\ncouldn\u2019t see the other day when he called.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Farmer Boldwood,\u201D murmured Bathsheba, and looked at him as he\r\noutstripped them. The farmer had never turned his head once, but with\r\neyes fixed on the most advanced point along the road, passed as\r\nunconsciously and abstractedly as if Bathsheba and her charms were thin\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s an interesting man\u2014don\u2019t you think so?\u201D she remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201CO yes, very. Everybody owns it,\u201D replied Liddy.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wonder why he is so wrapt up and indifferent, and seemingly so far\r\naway from all he sees around him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is said\u2014but not known for certain\u2014that he met with some bitter\r\ndisappointment when he was a young man and merry. A woman jilted him,\r\nthey say.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPeople always say that\u2014and we know very well women scarcely ever jilt\r\nmen; \u2019tis the men who jilt us. I expect it is simply his nature to be\r\nso reserved.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSimply his nature\u2014I expect so, miss\u2014nothing else in the world.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CStill, \u2019tis more romantic to think he has been served cruelly, poor\r\nthing\u2019! Perhaps, after all, he has!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDepend upon it he has. Oh yes, miss, he has! I feel he must have.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHowever, we are very apt to think extremes of people. I shouldn\u2019t\r\nwonder after all if it wasn\u2019t a little of both\u2014just between the\r\ntwo\u2014rather cruelly used and rather reserved.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh dear no, miss\u2014I can\u2019t think it between the two!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s most likely.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, yes, so it is. I am convinced it is most likely. You may take my\r\nword, miss, that that\u2019s what\u2019s the matter with him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nSORTES SANCTORUM\u2014THE VALENTINE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday afternoon in the farmhouse, on the thirteenth of\r\nFebruary. Dinner being over, Bathsheba, for want of a better companion,\r\nhad asked Liddy to come and sit with her. The mouldy pile was dreary in\r\nwinter-time before the candles were lighted and the shutters closed;\r\nthe atmosphere of the place seemed as old as the walls; every nook\r\nbehind the furniture had a temperature of its own, for the fire was not\r\nkindled in this part of the house early in the day; and Bathsheba\u2019s new\r\npiano, which was an old one in other annals, looked particularly\r\nsloping and out of level on the warped floor before night threw a shade\r\nover its less prominent angles and hid the unpleasantness. Liddy, like\r\na little brook, though shallow, was always rippling; her presence had\r\nnot so much weight as to task thought, and yet enough to exercise it.\r\n\r\nOn the table lay an old quarto Bible, bound in leather. Liddy looking\r\nat it said,\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you ever find out, miss, who you are going to marry by means of\r\nthe Bible and key?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t be so foolish, Liddy. As if such things could be.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, there\u2019s a good deal in it, all the same.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNonsense, child.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd it makes your heart beat fearful. Some believe in it; some don\u2019t;\r\nI do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well, let\u2019s try it,\u201D said Bathsheba, bounding from her seat with\r\nthat total disregard of consistency which can be indulged in towards a\r\ndependent, and entering into the spirit of divination at once. \u201CGo and\r\nget the front door key.\u201D\r\n\r\nLiddy fetched it. \u201CI wish it wasn\u2019t Sunday,\u201D she said, on returning.\r\n\u201CPerhaps \u2019tis wrong.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s right week days is right Sundays,\u201D replied her mistress in a\r\ntone which was a proof in itself.\r\n\r\nThe book was opened\u2014the leaves, drab with age, being quite worn away at\r\nmuch-read verses by the forefingers of unpractised readers in former\r\ndays, where they were moved along under the line as an aid to the\r\nvision. The special verse in the Book of Ruth was sought out by\r\nBathsheba, and the sublime words met her eye. They slightly thrilled\r\nand abashed her. It was Wisdom in the abstract facing Folly in the\r\nconcrete. Folly in the concrete blushed, persisted in her intention,\r\nand placed the key on the book. A rusty patch immediately upon the\r\nverse, caused by previous pressure of an iron substance thereon, told\r\nthat this was not the first time the old volume had been used for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow keep steady, and be silent,\u201D said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nThe verse was repeated; the book turned round; Bathsheba blushed\r\nguiltily.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho did you try?\u201D said Liddy curiously.\r\n\r\n\u201CI shall not tell you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you notice Mr. Boldwood\u2019s doings in church this morning, miss?\u201D\r\nLiddy continued, adumbrating by the remark the track her thoughts had\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, indeed,\u201D said Bathsheba, with serene indifference.\r\n\r\n\u201CHis pew is exactly opposite yours, miss.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI know it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you did not see his goings on!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly I did not, I tell you.\u201D\r\n\r\nLiddy assumed a smaller physiognomy, and shut her lips decisively.\r\n\r\nThis move was unexpected, and proportionately disconcerting. \u201CWhat did\r\nhe do?\u201D Bathsheba said perforce.\r\n\r\n\u201CDidn\u2019t turn his head to look at you once all the service.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy should he?\u201D again demanded her mistress, wearing a nettled look.\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t ask him to.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh no. But everybody else was noticing you; and it was odd he didn\u2019t.\r\nThere, \u2019tis like him. Rich and gentlemanly, what does he care?\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba dropped into a silence intended to express that she had\r\nopinions on the matter too abstruse for Liddy\u2019s comprehension, rather\r\nthan that she had nothing to say.\r\n\r\n\u201CDear me\u2014I had nearly forgotten the valentine I bought yesterday,\u201D she\r\nexclaimed at length.\r\n\r\n\u201CValentine! who for, miss?\u201D said Liddy. \u201CFarmer Boldwood?\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was the single name among all possible wrong ones that just at this\r\nmoment seemed to Bathsheba more pertinent than the right.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, no. It is only for little Teddy Coggan. I have promised him\r\nsomething, and this will be a pretty surprise for him. Liddy, you may\r\nas well bring me my desk and I\u2019ll direct it at once.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba took from her desk a gorgeously illuminated and embossed\r\ndesign in post-octavo, which had been bought on the previous market-day\r\nat the chief stationer\u2019s in Casterbridge. In the centre was a small\r\noval enclosure; this was left blank, that the sender might insert\r\ntender words more appropriate to the special occasion than any\r\ngeneralities by a printer could possibly be.\r\n\r\n\u201CHere\u2019s a place for writing,\u201D said Bathsheba. \u201CWhat shall I put?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSomething of this sort, I should think,\u201D returned Liddy promptly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CThe rose is red,\r\nThe violet blue,\r\nCarnation\u2019s sweet,\r\nAnd so are you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, that shall be it. It just suits itself to a chubby-faced child\r\nlike him,\u201D said Bathsheba. She inserted the words in a small though\r\nlegible handwriting; enclosed the sheet in an envelope, and dipped her\r\npen for the direction.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat fun it would be to send it to the stupid old Boldwood, and how he\r\nwould wonder!\u201D said the irrepressible Liddy, lifting her eyebrows, and\r\nindulging in an awful mirth on the verge of fear as she thought of the\r\nmoral and social magnitude of the man contemplated.\r\n\r\nBathsheba paused to regard the idea at full length. Boldwood\u2019s had\r\nbegun to be a troublesome image\u2014a species of Daniel in her kingdom who\r\npersisted in kneeling eastward when reason and common sense said that\r\nhe might just as well follow suit with the rest, and afford her the\r\nofficial glance of admiration which cost nothing at all. She was far\r\nfrom being seriously concerned about his nonconformity. Still, it was\r\nfaintly depressing that the most dignified and valuable man in the\r\nparish should withhold his eyes, and that a girl like Liddy should talk\r\nabout it. So Liddy\u2019s idea was at first rather harassing than piquant.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, I won\u2019t do that. He wouldn\u2019t see any humour in it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019d worry to death,\u201D said the persistent Liddy.\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, I don\u2019t care particularly to send it to Teddy,\u201D remarked her\r\nmistress. \u201CHe\u2019s rather a naughty child sometimes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014that he is.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLet\u2019s toss as men do,\u201D said Bathsheba, idly. \u201CNow then, head,\r\nBoldwood; tail, Teddy. No, we won\u2019t toss money on a Sunday, that would\r\nbe tempting the devil indeed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CToss this hymn-book; there can\u2019t be no sinfulness in that, miss.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well. Open, Boldwood\u2014shut, Teddy. No; it\u2019s more likely to fall\r\nopen. Open, Teddy\u2014shut, Boldwood.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe book went fluttering in the air and came down shut.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, a small yawn upon her mouth, took the pen, and with off-hand\r\nserenity directed the missive to Boldwood.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow light a candle, Liddy. Which seal shall we use? Here\u2019s a unicorn\u2019s\r\nhead\u2014there\u2019s nothing in that. What\u2019s this?\u2014two doves\u2014no. It ought to be\r\nsomething extraordinary, ought it not, Liddy? Here\u2019s one with a motto\u2014I\r\nremember it is some funny one, but I can\u2019t read it. We\u2019ll try this, and\r\nif it doesn\u2019t do we\u2019ll have another.\u201D\r\n\r\nA large red seal was duly affixed. Bathsheba looked closely at the hot\r\nwax to discover the words.\r\n\r\n\u201CCapital!\u201D she exclaimed, throwing down the letter frolicsomely.\r\n\u201C\u2019Twould upset the solemnity of a parson and clerke too.\u201D\r\n\r\nLiddy looked at the words of the seal, and read\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CMARRY ME.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same evening the letter was sent, and was duly sorted in\r\nCasterbridge post-office that night, to be returned to Weatherbury\r\nagain in the morning.\r\n\r\nSo very idly and unreflectingly was this deed done. Of love as a\r\nspectacle Bathsheba had a fair knowledge; but of love subjectively she\r\nknew nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nEFFECT OF THE LETTER\u2014SUNRISE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt dusk, on the evening of St. Valentine\u2019s Day, Boldwood sat down to\r\nsupper as usual, by a beaming fire of aged logs. Upon the mantel-shelf\r\nbefore him was a time-piece, surmounted by a spread eagle, and upon the\r\neagle\u2019s wings was the letter Bathsheba had sent. Here the bachelor\u2019s\r\ngaze was continually fastening itself, till the large red seal became\r\nas a blot of blood on the retina of his eye; and as he ate and drank he\r\nstill read in fancy the words thereon, although they were too remote\r\nfor his sight\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CMARRY ME.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pert injunction was like those crystal substances which, colourless\r\nthemselves, assume the tone of objects about them. Here, in the quiet\r\nof Boldwood\u2019s parlour, where everything that was not grave was\r\nextraneous, and where the atmosphere was that of a Puritan Sunday\r\nlasting all the week, the letter and its dictum changed their tenor\r\nfrom the thoughtlessness of their origin to a deep solemnity, imbibed\r\nfrom their accessories now.\r\n\r\nSince the receipt of the missive in the morning, Boldwood had felt the\r\nsymmetry of his existence to be slowly getting distorted in the\r\ndirection of an ideal passion. The disturbance was as the first\r\nfloating weed to Columbus\u2014the contemptibly little suggesting\r\npossibilities of the infinitely great.\r\n\r\nThe letter must have had an origin and a motive. That the latter was of\r\nthe smallest magnitude compatible with its existence at all, Boldwood,\r\nof course, did not know. And such an explanation did not strike him as\r\na possibility even. It is foreign to a mystified condition of mind to\r\nrealize of the mystifier that the processes of approving a course\r\nsuggested by circumstance, and of striking out a course from inner\r\nimpulse, would look the same in the result. The vast difference between\r\nstarting a train of events, and directing into a particular groove a\r\nseries already started, is rarely apparent to the person confounded by\r\nthe issue.\r\n\r\nWhen Boldwood went to bed he placed the valentine in the corner of the\r\nlooking-glass. He was conscious of its presence, even when his back was\r\nturned upon it. It was the first time in Boldwood\u2019s life that such an\r\nevent had occurred. The same fascination that caused him to think it an\r\nact which had a deliberate motive prevented him from regarding it as an\r\nimpertinence. He looked again at the direction. The mysterious\r\ninfluences of night invested the writing with the presence of the\r\nunknown writer. Somebody\u2019s\u2014some _woman\u2019s_\u2014hand had travelled softly\r\nover the paper bearing his name; her unrevealed eyes had watched every\r\ncurve as she formed it; her brain had seen him in imagination the\r\nwhile. Why should she have imagined him? Her mouth\u2014were the lips red or\r\npale, plump or creased?\u2014had curved itself to a certain expression as\r\nthe pen went on\u2014the corners had moved with all their natural\r\ntremulousness: what had been the expression?\r\n\r\nThe vision of the woman writing, as a supplement to the words written,\r\nhad no individuality. She was a misty shape, and well she might be,\r\nconsidering that her original was at that moment sound asleep and\r\noblivious of all love and letter-writing under the sky. Whenever\r\nBoldwood dozed she took a form, and comparatively ceased to be a\r\nvision: when he awoke there was the letter justifying the dream.\r\n\r\nThe moon shone to-night, and its light was not of a customary kind. His\r\nwindow admitted only a reflection of its rays, and the pale sheen had\r\nthat reversed direction which snow gives, coming upward and lighting up\r\nhis ceiling in an unnatural way, casting shadows in strange places, and\r\nputting lights where shadows had used to be.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the epistle had occupied him but little in comparison\r\nwith the fact of its arrival. He suddenly wondered if anything more\r\nmight be found in the envelope than what he had withdrawn. He jumped\r\nout of bed in the weird light, took the letter, pulled out the flimsy\r\nsheet, shook the envelope\u2014searched it. Nothing more was there. Boldwood\r\nlooked, as he had a hundred times the preceding day, at the insistent\r\nred seal: \u201CMarry me,\u201D he said aloud.\r\n\r\nThe solemn and reserved yeoman again closed the letter, and stuck it in\r\nthe frame of the glass. In doing so he caught sight of his reflected\r\nfeatures, wan in expression, and insubstantial in form. He saw how\r\nclosely compressed was his mouth, and that his eyes were wide-spread\r\nand vacant. Feeling uneasy and dissatisfied with himself for this\r\nnervous excitability, he returned to bed.\r\n\r\nThen the dawn drew on. The full power of the clear heaven was not equal\r\nto that of a cloudy sky at noon, when Boldwood arose and dressed\r\nhimself. He descended the stairs and went out towards the gate of a\r\nfield to the east, leaning over which he paused and looked around.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the usual slow sunrises of this time of the year, and the\r\nsky, pure violet in the zenith, was leaden to the northward, and murky\r\nto the east, where, over the snowy down or ewe-lease on Weatherbury\r\nUpper Farm, and apparently resting upon the ridge, the only half of the\r\nsun yet visible burnt rayless, like a red and flameless fire shining\r\nover a white hearthstone. The whole effect resembled a sunset as\r\nchildhood resembles age.\r\n\r\nIn other directions, the fields and sky were so much of one colour by\r\nthe snow, that it was difficult in a hasty glance to tell whereabouts\r\nthe horizon occurred; and in general there was here, too, that\r\nbefore-mentioned preternatural inversion of light and shade which\r\nattends the prospect when the garish brightness commonly in the sky is\r\nfound on the earth, and the shades of earth are in the sky. Over the\r\nwest hung the wasting moon, now dull and greenish-yellow, like\r\ntarnished brass.\r\n\r\nBoldwood was listlessly noting how the frost had hardened and glazed\r\nthe surface of the snow, till it shone in the red eastern light with\r\nthe polish of marble; how, in some portions of the slope, withered\r\ngrass-bents, encased in icicles, bristled through the smooth wan\r\ncoverlet in the twisted and curved shapes of old Venetian glass; and\r\nhow the footprints of a few birds, which had hopped over the snow\r\nwhilst it lay in the state of a soft fleece, were now frozen to a short\r\npermanency. A half-muffled noise of light wheels interrupted him.\r\nBoldwood turned back into the road. It was the mail-cart\u2014a crazy,\r\ntwo-wheeled vehicle, hardly heavy enough to resist a puff of wind. The\r\ndriver held out a letter. Boldwood seized it and opened it, expecting\r\nanother anonymous one\u2014so greatly are people\u2019s ideas of probability a\r\nmere sense that precedent will repeat itself.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think it is for you, sir,\u201D said the man, when he saw\r\nBoldwood\u2019s action. \u201CThough there is no name, I think it is for your\r\nshepherd.\u201D\r\n\r\nBoldwood looked then at the address\u2014\r\n\r\nTo the New Shepherd,\r\nWeatherbury Farm,\r\nNear Casterbridge\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201COh\u2014what a mistake!\u2014it is not mine. Nor is it for my shepherd. It is\r\nfor Miss Everdene\u2019s. You had better take it on to him\u2014Gabriel Oak\u2014and\r\nsay I opened it in mistake.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this moment, on the ridge, up against the blazing sky, a figure was\r\nvisible, like the black snuff in the midst of a candle-flame. Then it\r\nmoved and began to bustle about vigorously from place to place,\r\ncarrying square skeleton masses, which were riddled by the same rays. A\r\nsmall figure on all fours followed behind. The tall form was that of\r\nGabriel Oak; the small one that of George; the articles in course of\r\ntransit were hurdles.\r\n\r\n\u201CWait,\u201D said Boldwood. \u201CThat\u2019s the man on the hill. I\u2019ll take the\r\nletter to him myself.\u201D\r\n\r\nTo Boldwood it was now no longer merely a letter to another man. It was\r\nan opportunity. Exhibiting a face pregnant with intention, he entered\r\nthe snowy field.\r\n\r\nGabriel, at that minute, descended the hill towards the right. The glow\r\nstretched down in this direction now, and touched the distant roof of\r\nWarren\u2019s Malthouse\u2014whither the shepherd was apparently bent: Boldwood\r\nfollowed at a distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nA MORNING MEETING\u2014THE LETTER AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scarlet and orange light outside the malthouse did not penetrate to\r\nits interior, which was, as usual, lighted by a rival glow of similar\r\nhue, radiating from the hearth.\r\n\r\nThe maltster, after having lain down in his clothes for a few hours,\r\nwas now sitting beside a three-legged table, breakfasting off bread and\r\nbacon. This was eaten on the plateless system, which is performed by\r\nplacing a slice of bread upon the table, the meat flat upon the bread,\r\na mustard plaster upon the meat, and a pinch of salt upon the whole,\r\nthen cutting them vertically downwards with a large pocket-knife till\r\nwood is reached, when the severed lump is impaled on the knife,\r\nelevated, and sent the proper way of food.\r\n\r\nThe maltster\u2019s lack of teeth appeared not to sensibly diminish his\r\npowers as a mill. He had been without them for so many years that\r\ntoothlessness was felt less to be a defect than hard gums an\r\nacquisition. Indeed, he seemed to approach the grave as a hyperbolic\r\ncurve approaches a straight line\u2014less directly as he got nearer, till\r\nit was doubtful if he would ever reach it at all.\r\n\r\nIn the ashpit was a heap of potatoes roasting, and a boiling pipkin of\r\ncharred bread, called \u201Ccoffee\u201D, for the benefit of whomsoever should\r\ncall, for Warren\u2019s was a sort of clubhouse, used as an alternative to\r\nthe inn.\r\n\r\n\u201CI say, says I, we get a fine day, and then down comes a snapper at\r\nnight,\u201D was a remark now suddenly heard spreading into the malthouse\r\nfrom the door, which had been opened the previous moment. The form of\r\nHenery Fray advanced to the fire, stamping the snow from his boots when\r\nabout half-way there. The speech and entry had not seemed to be at all\r\nan abrupt beginning to the maltster, introductory matter being often\r\nomitted in this neighbourhood, both from word and deed, and the\r\nmaltster having the same latitude allowed him, did not hurry to reply.\r\nHe picked up a fragment of cheese, by pecking upon it with his knife,\r\nas a butcher picks up skewers.\r\n\r\nHenery appeared in a drab kerseymere great-coat, buttoned over his\r\nsmock-frock, the white skirts of the latter being visible to the\r\ndistance of about a foot below the coat-tails, which, when you got used\r\nto the style of dress, looked natural enough, and even ornamental\u2014it\r\ncertainly was comfortable.\r\n\r\nMatthew Moon, Joseph Poorgrass, and other carters and waggoners\r\nfollowed at his heels, with great lanterns dangling from their hands,\r\nwhich showed that they had just come from the cart-horse stables, where\r\nthey had been busily engaged since four o\u2019clock that morning.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd how is she getting on without a baily?\u201D the maltster inquired.\r\nHenery shook his head, and smiled one of the bitter smiles, dragging\r\nall the flesh of his forehead into a corrugated heap in the centre.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019ll rue it\u2014surely, surely!\u201D he said. \u201CBenjy Pennyways were not a\r\ntrue man or an honest baily\u2014as big a betrayer as Judas Iscariot\r\nhimself. But to think she can carr\u2019 on alone!\u201D He allowed his head to\r\nswing laterally three or four times in silence. \u201CNever in all my\r\ncreeping up\u2014never!\u201D\r\n\r\nThis was recognized by all as the conclusion of some gloomy speech\r\nwhich had been expressed in thought alone during the shake of the head;\r\nHenery meanwhile retained several marks of despair upon his face, to\r\nimply that they would be required for use again directly he should go\r\non speaking.\r\n\r\n\u201CAll will be ruined, and ourselves too, or there\u2019s no meat in\r\ngentlemen\u2019s houses!\u201D said Mark Clark.\r\n\r\n\u201CA headstrong maid, that\u2019s what she is\u2014and won\u2019t listen to no advice at\r\nall. Pride and vanity have ruined many a cobbler\u2019s dog. Dear, dear,\r\nwhen I think o\u2019 it, I sorrows like a man in travel!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue, Henery, you do, I\u2019ve heard ye,\u201D said Joseph Poorgrass in a voice\r\nof thorough attestation, and with a wire-drawn smile of misery.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Twould do a martel man no harm to have what\u2019s under her bonnet,\u201D said\r\nBilly Smallbury, who had just entered, bearing his one tooth before\r\nhim. \u201CShe can spaik real language, and must have some sense somewhere.\r\nDo ye foller me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do, I do; but no baily\u2014I deserved that place,\u201D wailed Henery,\r\nsignifying wasted genius by gazing blankly at visions of a high destiny\r\napparently visible to him on Billy Smallbury\u2019s smock-frock. \u201CThere,\r\n\u2019twas to be, I suppose. Your lot is your lot, and Scripture is nothing;\r\nfor if you do good you don\u2019t get rewarded according to your works, but\r\nbe cheated in some mean way out of your recompense.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no; I don\u2019t agree with\u2019ee there,\u201D said Mark Clark. \u201CGod\u2019s a\r\nperfect gentleman in that respect.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood works good pay, so to speak it,\u201D attested Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\nA short pause ensued, and as a sort of _entr\u2019acte_ Henery turned and\r\nblew out the lanterns, which the increase of daylight rendered no\r\nlonger necessary even in the malthouse, with its one pane of glass.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wonder what a farmer-woman can want with a harpsichord, dulcimer,\r\npianner, or whatever \u2019tis they d\u2019call it?\u201D said the maltster. \u201CLiddy\r\nsaith she\u2019ve a new one.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGot a pianner?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy. Seems her old uncle\u2019s things were not good enough for her. She\u2019ve\r\nbought all but everything new. There\u2019s heavy chairs for the stout, weak\r\nand wiry ones for the slender; great watches, getting on to the size of\r\nclocks, to stand upon the chimbley-piece.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPictures, for the most part wonderful frames.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd long horse-hair settles for the drunk, with horse-hair pillows at\r\neach end,\u201D said Mr. Clark. \u201CLikewise looking-glasses for the pretty,\r\nand lying books for the wicked.\u201D\r\n\r\nA firm loud tread was now heard stamping outside; the door was opened\r\nabout six inches, and somebody on the other side exclaimed\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CNeighbours, have ye got room for a few new-born lambs?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, sure, shepherd,\u201D said the conclave.\r\n\r\nThe door was flung back till it kicked the wall and trembled from top\r\nto bottom with the blow. Mr. Oak appeared in the entry with a steaming\r\nface, hay-bands wound about his ankles to keep out the snow, a leather\r\nstrap round his waist outside the smock-frock, and looking altogether\r\nan epitome of the world\u2019s health and vigour. Four lambs hung in various\r\nembarrassing attitudes over his shoulders, and the dog George, whom\r\nGabriel had contrived to fetch from Norcombe, stalked solemnly behind.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, Shepherd Oak, and how\u2019s lambing this year, if I mid say it?\u201D\r\ninquired Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\n\u201CTerrible trying,\u201D said Oak. \u201CI\u2019ve been wet through twice a-day, either\r\nin snow or rain, this last fortnight. Cainy and I haven\u2019t tined our\r\neyes to-night.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA good few twins, too, I hear?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CToo many by half. Yes; \u2019tis a very queer lambing this year. We shan\u2019t\r\nhave done by Lady Day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd last year \u2019twer all over by Sexajessamine Sunday,\u201D Joseph\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\u201CBring on the rest Cain,\u201D said Gabriel, \u201Cand then run back to the ewes.\r\nI\u2019ll follow you soon.\u201D\r\n\r\nCainy Ball\u2014a cheery-faced young lad, with a small circular orifice by\r\nway of mouth, advanced and deposited two others, and retired as he was\r\nbidden. Oak lowered the lambs from their unnatural elevation, wrapped\r\nthem in hay, and placed them round the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ve no lambing-hut here, as I used to have at Norcombe,\u201D said\r\nGabriel, \u201Cand \u2019tis such a plague to bring the weakly ones to a house.\r\nIf \u2019twasn\u2019t for your place here, malter, I don\u2019t know what I should do\r\ni\u2019 this keen weather. And how is it with you to-day, malter?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, neither sick nor sorry, shepherd; but no younger.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy\u2014I understand.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSit down, Shepherd Oak,\u201D continued the ancient man of malt. \u201CAnd how\r\nwas the old place at Norcombe, when ye went for your dog? I should like\r\nto see the old familiar spot; but faith, I shouldn\u2019t know a soul there\r\nnow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI suppose you wouldn\u2019t. \u2019Tis altered very much.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs it true that Dicky Hill\u2019s wooden cider-house is pulled down?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh yes\u2014years ago, and Dicky\u2019s cottage just above it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, to be sure!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; and Tompkins\u2019s old apple-tree is rooted that used to bear two\r\nhogsheads of cider; and no help from other trees.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CRooted?\u2014you don\u2019t say it! Ah! stirring times we live in\u2014stirring\r\ntimes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you can mind the old well that used to be in the middle of the\r\nplace? That\u2019s turned into a solid iron pump with a large stone trough,\r\nand all complete.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDear, dear\u2014how the face of nations alter, and what we live to see\r\nnowadays! Yes\u2014and \u2019tis the same here. They\u2019ve been talking but now of\r\nthe mis\u2019ess\u2019s strange doings.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat have you been saying about her?\u201D inquired Oak, sharply turning to\r\nthe rest, and getting very warm.\r\n\r\n\u201CThese middle-aged men have been pulling her over the coals for pride\r\nand vanity,\u201D said Mark Clark; \u201Cbut I say, let her have rope enough.\r\nBless her pretty face\u2014shouldn\u2019t I like to do so\u2014upon her cherry lips!\u201D\r\nThe gallant Mark Clark here made a peculiar and well known sound with\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\n\u201CMark,\u201D said Gabriel, sternly, \u201Cnow you mind this! none of that\r\ndalliance-talk\u2014that smack-and-coddle style of yours\u2014about Miss\r\nEverdene. I don\u2019t allow it. Do you hear?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWith all my heart, as I\u2019ve got no chance,\u201D replied Mr. Clark,\r\ncordially.\r\n\r\n\u201CI suppose you\u2019ve been speaking against her?\u201D said Oak, turning to\r\nJoseph Poorgrass with a very grim look.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no\u2014not a word I\u2014\u2019tis a real joyful thing that she\u2019s no worse,\r\nthat\u2019s what I say,\u201D said Joseph, trembling and blushing with terror.\r\n\u201CMatthew just said\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMatthew Moon, what have you been saying?\u201D asked Oak.\r\n\r\n\u201CI? Why ye know I wouldn\u2019t harm a worm\u2014no, not one underground worm?\u201D\r\nsaid Matthew Moon, looking very uneasy.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, somebody has\u2014and look here, neighbours,\u201D Gabriel, though one of\r\nthe quietest and most gentle men on earth, rose to the occasion, with\r\nmartial promptness and vigour. \u201CThat\u2019s my fist.\u201D Here he placed his\r\nfist, rather smaller in size than a common loaf, in the mathematical\r\ncentre of the maltster\u2019s little table, and with it gave a bump or two\r\nthereon, as if to ensure that their eyes all thoroughly took in the\r\nidea of fistiness before he went further. \u201CNow\u2014the first man in the\r\nparish that I hear prophesying bad of our mistress, why\u201D (here the fist\r\nwas raised and let fall as Thor might have done with his hammer in\r\nassaying it)\u2014\u201Che\u2019ll smell and taste that\u2014or I\u2019m a Dutchman.\u201D\r\n\r\nAll earnestly expressed by their features that their minds did not\r\nwander to Holland for a moment on account of this statement, but were\r\ndeploring the difference which gave rise to the figure; and Mark Clark\r\ncried \u201CHear, hear; just what I should ha\u2019 said.\u201D The dog George looked\r\nup at the same time after the shepherd\u2019s menace, and though he\r\nunderstood English but imperfectly, began to growl.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, don\u2019t ye take on so, shepherd, and sit down!\u201D said Henery, with a\r\ndeprecating peacefulness equal to anything of the kind in Christianity.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe hear that ye be a extraordinary good and clever man, shepherd,\u201D\r\nsaid Joseph Poorgrass with considerable anxiety from behind the\r\nmaltster\u2019s bedstead, whither he had retired for safety. \u201C\u2019Tis a great\r\nthing to be clever, I\u2019m sure,\u201D he added, making movements associated\r\nwith states of mind rather than body; \u201Cwe wish we were, don\u2019t we,\r\nneighbours?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, that we do, sure,\u201D said Matthew Moon, with a small anxious laugh\r\ntowards Oak, to show how very friendly disposed he was likewise.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho\u2019s been telling you I\u2019m clever?\u201D said Oak.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis blowed about from pillar to post quite common,\u201D said Matthew. \u201CWe\r\nhear that ye can tell the time as well by the stars as we can by the\r\nsun and moon, shepherd.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I can do a little that way,\u201D said Gabriel, as a man of medium\r\nsentiments on the subject.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd that ye can make sun-dials, and prent folks\u2019 names upon their\r\nwaggons almost like copper-plate, with beautiful flourishes, and great\r\nlong tails. A excellent fine thing for ye to be such a clever man,\r\nshepherd. Joseph Poorgrass used to prent to Farmer James Everdene\u2019s\r\nwaggons before you came, and \u2019a could never mind which way to turn the\r\nJ\u2019s and E\u2019s\u2014could ye, Joseph?\u201D Joseph shook his head to express how\r\nabsolute was the fact that he couldn\u2019t. \u201CAnd so you used to do \u2019em the\r\nwrong way, like this, didn\u2019t ye, Joseph?\u201D Matthew marked on the dusty\r\nfloor with his whip-handle\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The word J A M E S appears here with the \u201CJ\u201D, \u201CE\u201D, and\r\n\u201CS\u201D printed backwards]\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd how Farmer James would cuss, and call thee a fool, wouldn\u2019t he,\r\nJoseph, when \u2019a seed his name looking so inside-out-like?\u201D continued\r\nMatthew Moon with feeling.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy\u2014\u2019a would,\u201D said Joseph, meekly. \u201CBut, you see, I wasn\u2019t so much to\r\nblame, for them J\u2019s and E\u2019s be such trying sons o\u2019 witches for the\r\nmemory to mind whether they face backward or forward; and I always had\r\nsuch a forgetful memory, too.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis a very bad affliction for ye, being such a man of calamities in\r\nother ways.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, \u2019tis; but a happy Providence ordered that it should be no worse,\r\nand I feel my thanks. As to shepherd, there, I\u2019m sure mis\u2019ess ought to\r\nhave made ye her baily\u2014such a fitting man for\u2019t as you be.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t mind owning that I expected it,\u201D said Oak, frankly. \u201CIndeed, I\r\nhoped for the place. At the same time, Miss Everdene has a right to be\r\nher own baily if she choose\u2014and to keep me down to be a common shepherd\r\nonly.\u201D Oak drew a slow breath, looked sadly into the bright ashpit, and\r\nseemed lost in thoughts not of the most hopeful hue.\r\n\r\nThe genial warmth of the fire now began to stimulate the nearly\r\nlifeless lambs to bleat and move their limbs briskly upon the hay, and\r\nto recognize for the first time the fact that they were born. Their\r\nnoise increased to a chorus of baas, upon which Oak pulled the milk-can\r\nfrom before the fire, and taking a small tea-pot from the pocket of his\r\nsmock-frock, filled it with milk, and taught those of the helpless\r\ncreatures which were not to be restored to their dams how to drink from\r\nthe spout\u2014a trick they acquired with astonishing aptitude.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd she don\u2019t even let ye have the skins of the dead lambs, I hear?\u201D\r\nresumed Joseph Poorgrass, his eyes lingering on the operations of Oak\r\nwith the necessary melancholy.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t have them,\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe be very badly used, shepherd,\u201D hazarded Joseph again, in the hope\r\nof getting Oak as an ally in lamentation after all. \u201CI think she\u2019s took\r\nagainst ye\u2014that I do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh no\u2014not at all,\u201D replied Gabriel, hastily, and a sigh escaped him,\r\nwhich the deprivation of lamb skins could hardly have caused.\r\n\r\nBefore any further remark had been added a shade darkened the door, and\r\nBoldwood entered the malthouse, bestowing upon each a nod of a quality\r\nbetween friendliness and condescension.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! Oak, I thought you were here,\u201D he said. \u201CI met the mail-cart ten\r\nminutes ago, and a letter was put into my hand, which I opened without\r\nreading the address. I believe it is yours. You must excuse the\r\naccident please.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh yes\u2014not a bit of difference, Mr. Boldwood\u2014not a bit,\u201D said Gabriel,\r\nreadily. He had not a correspondent on earth, nor was there a possible\r\nletter coming to him whose contents the whole parish would not have\r\nbeen welcome to peruse.\r\n\r\nOak stepped aside, and read the following in an unknown hand:\u2014\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND,\u2014I do not know your name, but I think these few lines will\r\nreach you, which I wrote to thank you for your kindness to me the night\r\nI left Weatherbury in a reckless way. I also return the money I owe\r\nyou, which you will excuse my not keeping as a gift. All has ended\r\nwell, and I am happy to say I am going to be married to the young man\r\nwho has courted me for some time\u2014Sergeant Troy, of the 11th Dragoon\r\nGuards, now quartered in this town. He would, I know, object to my\r\nhaving received anything except as a loan, being a man of great\r\nrespectability and high honour\u2014indeed, a nobleman by blood.\r\n    I should be much obliged to you if you would keep the contents of\r\n    this letter a secret for the present, dear friend. We mean to\r\n    surprise Weatherbury by coming there soon as husband and wife,\r\n    though I blush to state it to one nearly a stranger. The sergeant\r\n    grew up in Weatherbury. Thanking you again for your kindness,\r\n\r\n\r\nI am, your sincere well-wisher,\r\nFANNY ROBIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you read it, Mr. Boldwood?\u201D said Gabriel; \u201Cif not, you had better\r\ndo so. I know you are interested in Fanny Robin.\u201D\r\n\r\nBoldwood read the letter and looked grieved.\r\n\r\n\u201CFanny\u2014poor Fanny! the end she is so confident of has not yet come, she\r\nshould remember\u2014and may never come. I see she gives no address.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat sort of a man is this Sergeant Troy?\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CH\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m afraid not one to build much hope upon in such a case as\r\nthis,\u201D the farmer murmured, \u201Cthough he\u2019s a clever fellow, and up to\r\neverything. A slight romance attaches to him, too. His mother was a\r\nFrench governess, and it seems that a secret attachment existed between\r\nher and the late Lord Severn. She was married to a poor medical man,\r\nand soon after an infant was born; and while money was forthcoming all\r\nwent on well. Unfortunately for her boy, his best friends died; and he\r\ngot then a situation as second clerk at a lawyer\u2019s in Casterbridge. He\r\nstayed there for some time, and might have worked himself into a\r\ndignified position of some sort had he not indulged in the wild freak\r\nof enlisting. I have much doubt if ever little Fanny will surprise us\r\nin the way she mentions\u2014very much doubt. A silly girl!\u2014silly girl!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe door was hurriedly burst open again, and in came running Cainy Ball\r\nout of breath, his mouth red and open, like the bell of a penny\r\ntrumpet, from which he coughed with noisy vigour and great distension\r\nof face.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, Cain Ball,\u201D said Oak, sternly, \u201Cwhy will you run so fast and lose\r\nyour breath so? I\u2019m always telling you of it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh\u2014I\u2014a puff of mee breath\u2014went\u2014the\u2014wrong way, please, Mister Oak, and\r\nmade me cough\u2014hok\u2014hok!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell\u2014what have you come for?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve run to tell ye,\u201D said the junior shepherd, supporting his\r\nexhausted youthful frame against the doorpost, \u201Cthat you must come\r\ndirectly. Two more ewes have twinned\u2014that\u2019s what\u2019s the matter, Shepherd\r\nOak.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, that\u2019s it,\u201D said Oak, jumping up, and dimissing for the present\r\nhis thoughts on poor Fanny. \u201CYou are a good boy to run and tell me,\r\nCain, and you shall smell a large plum pudding some day as a treat.\r\nBut, before we go, Cainy, bring the tarpot, and we\u2019ll mark this lot and\r\nhave done with \u2019em.\u201D\r\n\r\nOak took from his illimitable pockets a marking iron, dipped it into\r\nthe pot, and imprinted on the buttocks of the infant sheep the initials\r\nof her he delighted to muse on\u2014\u201CB. E.,\u201D which signified to all the\r\nregion round that henceforth the lambs belonged to Farmer Bathsheba\r\nEverdene, and to no one else.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, Cainy, shoulder your two, and off. Good morning, Mr. Boldwood.\u201D\r\nThe shepherd lifted the sixteen large legs and four small bodies he had\r\nhimself brought, and vanished with them in the direction of the lambing\r\nfield hard by\u2014their frames being now in a sleek and hopeful state,\r\npleasantly contrasting with their death\u2019s-door plight of half an hour\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nBoldwood followed him a little way up the field, hesitated, and turned\r\nback. He followed him again with a last resolve, annihilating return.\r\nOn approaching the nook in which the fold was constructed, the farmer\r\ndrew out his pocket-book, unfastened it, and allowed it to lie open on\r\nhis hand. A letter was revealed\u2014Bathsheba\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\u201CI was going to ask you, Oak,\u201D he said, with unreal carelessness, \u201Cif\r\nyou know whose writing this is?\u201D\r\n\r\nOak glanced into the book, and replied instantly, with a flushed face,\r\n\u201CMiss Everdene\u2019s.\u201D\r\n\r\nOak had coloured simply at the consciousness of sounding her name. He\r\nnow felt a strangely distressing qualm from a new thought. The letter\r\ncould of course be no other than anonymous, or the inquiry would not\r\nhave been necessary.\r\n\r\nBoldwood mistook his confusion: sensitive persons are always ready with\r\ntheir \u201CIs it I?\u201D in preference to objective reasoning.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe question was perfectly fair,\u201D he returned\u2014and there was something\r\nincongruous in the serious earnestness with which he applied himself to\r\nan argument on a valentine. \u201CYou know it is always expected that privy\r\ninquiries will be made: that\u2019s where the\u2014fun lies.\u201D If the word \u201Cfun\u201D\r\nhad been \u201Ctorture,\u201D it could not have been uttered with a more\r\nconstrained and restless countenance than was Boldwood\u2019s then.\r\n\r\nSoon parting from Gabriel, the lonely and reserved man returned to his\r\nhouse to breakfast\u2014feeling twinges of shame and regret at having so far\r\nexposed his mood by those fevered questions to a stranger. He again\r\nplaced the letter on the mantelpiece, and sat down to think of the\r\ncircumstances attending it by the light of Gabriel\u2019s information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nALL SAINTS\u2019 AND ALL SOULS\u2019\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a week-day morning a small congregation, consisting mainly of women\r\nand girls, rose from its knees in the mouldy nave of a church called\r\nAll Saints\u2019, in the distant barrack-town before-mentioned, at the end\r\nof a service without a sermon. They were about to disperse, when a\r\nsmart footstep, entering the porch and coming up the central passage,\r\narrested their attention. The step echoed with a ring unusual in a\r\nchurch; it was the clink of spurs. Everybody looked. A young cavalry\r\nsoldier in a red uniform, with the three chevrons of a sergeant upon\r\nhis sleeve, strode up the aisle, with an embarrassment which was only\r\nthe more marked by the intense vigour of his step, and by the\r\ndetermination upon his face to show none. A slight flush had mounted\r\nhis cheek by the time he had run the gauntlet between these women; but,\r\npassing on through the chancel arch, he never paused till he came close\r\nto the altar railing. Here for a moment he stood alone.\r\n\r\nThe officiating curate, who had not yet doffed his surplice, perceived\r\nthe new-comer, and followed him to the communion-space. He whispered to\r\nthe soldier, and then beckoned to the clerk, who in his turn whispered\r\nto an elderly woman, apparently his wife, and they also went up the\r\nchancel steps.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis a wedding!\u201D murmured some of the women, brightening. \u201CLet\u2019s\r\nwait!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe majority again sat down.\r\n\r\nThere was a creaking of machinery behind, and some of the young ones\r\nturned their heads. From the interior face of the west wall of the\r\ntower projected a little canopy with a quarter-jack and small bell\r\nbeneath it, the automaton being driven by the same clock machinery that\r\nstruck the large bell in the tower. Between the tower and the church\r\nwas a close screen, the door of which was kept shut during services,\r\nhiding this grotesque clockwork from sight. At present, however, the\r\ndoor was open, and the egress of the jack, the blows on the bell, and\r\nthe mannikin\u2019s retreat into the nook again, were visible to many, and\r\naudible throughout the church.\r\n\r\nThe jack had struck half-past eleven.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere\u2019s the woman?\u201D whispered some of the spectators.\r\n\r\nThe young sergeant stood still with the abnormal rigidity of the old\r\npillars around. He faced the south-east, and was as silent as he was\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nThe silence grew to be a noticeable thing as the minutes went on, and\r\nnobody else appeared, and not a soul moved. The rattle of the\r\nquarter-jack again from its niche, its blows for three-quarters, its\r\nfussy retreat, were almost painfully abrupt, and caused many of the\r\ncongregation to start palpably.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wonder where the woman is!\u201D a voice whispered again.\r\n\r\nThere began now that slight shifting of feet, that artificial coughing\r\namong several, which betrays a nervous suspense. At length there was a\r\ntitter. But the soldier never moved. There he stood, his face to the\r\nsouth-east, upright as a column, his cap in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe clock ticked on. The women threw off their nervousness, and titters\r\nand giggling became more frequent. Then came a dead silence. Every one\r\nwas waiting for the end. Some persons may have noticed how\r\nextraordinarily the striking of quarters seems to quicken the flight of\r\ntime. It was hardly credible that the jack had not got wrong with the\r\nminutes when the rattle began again, the puppet emerged, and the four\r\nquarters were struck fitfully as before. One could almost be positive\r\nthat there was a malicious leer upon the hideous creature\u2019s face, and a\r\nmischievous delight in its twitchings. Then followed the dull and\r\nremote resonance of the twelve heavy strokes in the tower above. The\r\nwomen were impressed, and there was no giggle this time.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman glided into the vestry, and the clerk vanished. The\r\nsergeant had not yet turned; every woman in the church was waiting to\r\nsee his face, and he appeared to know it. At last he did turn, and\r\nstalked resolutely down the nave, braving them all, with a compressed\r\nlip. Two bowed and toothless old almsmen then looked at each other and\r\nchuckled, innocently enough; but the sound had a strange weird effect\r\nin that place.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the church was a paved square, around which several\r\noverhanging wood buildings of old time cast a picturesque shade. The\r\nyoung man on leaving the door went to cross the square, when, in the\r\nmiddle, he met a little woman. The expression of her face, which had\r\nbeen one of intense anxiety, sank at the sight of his nearly to terror.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell?\u201D he said, in a suppressed passion, fixedly looking at her.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Frank\u2014I made a mistake!\u2014I thought that church with the spire was\r\nAll Saints\u2019, and I was at the door at half-past eleven to a minute as\r\nyou said. I waited till a quarter to twelve, and found then that I was\r\nin All Souls\u2019. But I wasn\u2019t much frightened, for I thought it could be\r\nto-morrow as well.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou fool, for so fooling me! But say no more.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShall it be to-morrow, Frank?\u201D she asked blankly.\r\n\r\n\u201CTo-morrow!\u201D and he gave vent to a hoarse laugh. \u201CI don\u2019t go through\r\nthat experience again for some time, I warrant you!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut after all,\u201D she expostulated in a trembling voice, \u201Cthe mistake\r\nwas not such a terrible thing! Now, dear Frank, when shall it be?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, when? God knows!\u201D he said, with a light irony, and turning from\r\nher walked rapidly away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\nIN THE MARKET-PLACE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Saturday Boldwood was in Casterbridge market house as usual, when\r\nthe disturber of his dreams entered and became visible to him. Adam had\r\nawakened from his deep sleep, and behold! there was Eve. The farmer\r\ntook courage, and for the first time really looked at her.\r\n\r\nMaterial causes and emotional effects are not to be arranged in regular\r\nequation. The result from capital employed in the production of any\r\nmovement of a mental nature is sometimes as tremendous as the cause\r\nitself is absurdly minute. When women are in a freakish mood, their\r\nusual intuition, either from carelessness or inherent defect, seemingly\r\nfails to teach them this, and hence it was that Bathsheba was fated to\r\nbe astonished to-day.\r\n\r\nBoldwood looked at her\u2014not slily, critically, or understandingly, but\r\nblankly at gaze, in the way a reaper looks up at a passing train\u2014as\r\nsomething foreign to his element, and but dimly understood. To Boldwood\r\nwomen had been remote phenomena rather than necessary\r\ncomplements\u2014comets of such uncertain aspect, movement, and permanence,\r\nthat whether their orbits were as geometrical, unchangeable, and as\r\nsubject to laws as his own, or as absolutely erratic as they\r\nsuperficially appeared, he had not deemed it his duty to consider.\r\n\r\nHe saw her black hair, her correct facial curves and profile, and the\r\nroundness of her chin and throat. He saw then the side of her eyelids,\r\neyes, and lashes, and the shape of her ear. Next he noticed her figure,\r\nher skirt, and the very soles of her shoes.\r\n\r\nBoldwood thought her beautiful, but wondered whether he was right in\r\nhis thought, for it seemed impossible that this romance in the flesh,\r\nif so sweet as he imagined, could have been going on long without\r\ncreating a commotion of delight among men, and provoking more inquiry\r\nthan Bathsheba had done, even though that was not a little. To the best\r\nof his judgement neither nature nor art could improve this perfect one\r\nof an imperfect many. His heart began to move within him. Boldwood, it\r\nmust be remembered, though forty years of age, had never before\r\ninspected a woman with the very centre and force of his glance; they\r\nhad struck upon all his senses at wide angles.\r\n\r\nWas she really beautiful? He could not assure himself that his opinion\r\nwas true even now. He furtively said to a neighbour, \u201CIs Miss Everdene\r\nconsidered handsome?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh yes; she was a good deal noticed the first time she came, if you\r\nremember. A very handsome girl indeed.\u201D\r\n\r\nA man is never more credulous than in receiving favourable opinions on\r\nthe beauty of a woman he is half, or quite, in love with; a mere\r\nchild\u2019s word on the point has the weight of an R.A.\u2019s. Boldwood was\r\nsatisfied now.\r\n\r\nAnd this charming woman had in effect said to him, \u201CMarry me.\u201D Why\r\nshould she have done that strange thing? Boldwood\u2019s blindness to the\r\ndifference between approving of what circumstances suggest, and\r\noriginating what they do not suggest, was well matched by Bathsheba\u2019s\r\ninsensibility to the possibly great issues of little beginnings.\r\n\r\nShe was at this moment coolly dealing with a dashing young farmer,\r\nadding up accounts with him as indifferently as if his face had been\r\nthe pages of a ledger. It was evident that such a nature as his had no\r\nattraction for a woman of Bathsheba\u2019s taste. But Boldwood grew hot down\r\nto his hands with an incipient jealousy; he trod for the first time the\r\nthreshold of \u201Cthe injured lover\u2019s hell.\u201D His first impulse was to go\r\nand thrust himself between them. This could be done, but only in one\r\nway\u2014by asking to see a sample of her corn. Boldwood renounced the idea.\r\nHe could not make the request; it was debasing loveliness to ask it to\r\nbuy and sell, and jarred with his conceptions of her.\r\n\r\nAll this time Bathsheba was conscious of having broken into that\r\ndignified stronghold at last. His eyes, she knew, were following her\r\neverywhere. This was a triumph; and had it come naturally, such a\r\ntriumph would have been the sweeter to her for this piquing delay. But\r\nit had been brought about by misdirected ingenuity, and she valued it\r\nonly as she valued an artificial flower or a wax fruit.\r\n\r\nBeing a woman with some good sense in reasoning on subjects wherein her\r\nheart was not involved, Bathsheba genuinely repented that a freak which\r\nhad owed its existence as much to Liddy as to herself, should ever have\r\nbeen undertaken, to disturb the placidity of a man she respected too\r\nhighly to deliberately tease.\r\n\r\nShe that day nearly formed the intention of begging his pardon on the\r\nvery next occasion of their meeting. The worst features of this\r\narrangement were that, if he thought she ridiculed him, an apology\r\nwould increase the offence by being disbelieved; and if he thought she\r\nwanted him to woo her, it would read like additional evidence of her\r\nforwardness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\nBoldwood in Meditation\u2014Regret\r\n\r\n\r\nBoldwood was tenant of what was called Little Weatherbury Farm, and his\r\nperson was the nearest approach to aristocracy that this remoter\r\nquarter of the parish could boast of. Genteel strangers, whose god was\r\ntheir town, who might happen to be compelled to linger about this nook\r\nfor a day, heard the sound of light wheels, and prayed to see good\r\nsociety, to the degree of a solitary lord, or squire at the very least,\r\nbut it was only Mr. Boldwood going out for the day. They heard the\r\nsound of wheels yet once more, and were re-animated to expectancy: it\r\nwas only Mr. Boldwood coming home again.\r\n\r\nHis house stood recessed from the road, and the stables, which are to a\r\nfarm what a fireplace is to a room, were behind, their lower portions\r\nbeing lost amid bushes of laurel. Inside the blue door, open half-way\r\ndown, were to be seen at this time the backs and tails of half-a-dozen\r\nwarm and contented horses standing in their stalls; and as thus viewed,\r\nthey presented alternations of roan and bay, in shapes like a Moorish\r\narch, the tail being a streak down the midst of each. Over these, and\r\nlost to the eye gazing in from the outer light, the mouths of the same\r\nanimals could be heard busily sustaining the above-named warmth and\r\nplumpness by quantities of oats and hay. The restless and shadowy\r\nfigure of a colt wandered about a loose-box at the end, whilst the\r\nsteady grind of all the eaters was occasionally diversified by the\r\nrattle of a rope or the stamp of a foot.\r\n\r\nPacing up and down at the heels of the animals was Farmer Boldwood\r\nhimself. This place was his almonry and cloister in one: here, after\r\nlooking to the feeding of his four-footed dependants, the celibate\r\nwould walk and meditate of an evening till the moon\u2019s rays streamed in\r\nthrough the cobwebbed windows, or total darkness enveloped the scene.\r\n\r\nHis square-framed perpendicularity showed more fully now than in the\r\ncrowd and bustle of the market-house. In this meditative walk his foot\r\nmet the floor with heel and toe simultaneously, and his fine\r\nreddish-fleshed face was bent downwards just enough to render obscure\r\nthe still mouth and the well-rounded though rather prominent and broad\r\nchin. A few clear and thread-like horizontal lines were the only\r\ninterruption to the otherwise smooth surface of his large forehead.\r\n\r\nThe phases of Boldwood\u2019s life were ordinary enough, but his was not an\r\nordinary nature. That stillness, which struck casual observers more\r\nthan anything else in his character and habit, and seemed so precisely\r\nlike the rest of inanition, may have been the perfect balance of\r\nenormous antagonistic forces\u2014positives and negatives in fine\r\nadjustment. His equilibrium disturbed, he was in extremity at once. If\r\nan emotion possessed him at all, it ruled him; a feeling not mastering\r\nhim was entirely latent. Stagnant or rapid, it was never slow. He was\r\nalways hit mortally, or he was missed.\r\n\r\nHe had no light and careless touches in his constitution, either for\r\ngood or for evil. Stern in the outlines of action, mild in the details,\r\nhe was serious throughout all. He saw no absurd sides to the follies of\r\nlife, and thus, though not quite companionable in the eyes of merry men\r\nand scoffers, and those to whom all things show life as a jest, he was\r\nnot intolerable to the earnest and those acquainted with grief. Being a\r\nman who read all the dramas of life seriously, if he failed to please\r\nwhen they were comedies, there was no frivolous treatment to reproach\r\nhim for when they chanced to end tragically.\r\n\r\nBathsheba was far from dreaming that the dark and silent shape upon\r\nwhich she had so carelessly thrown a seed was a hotbed of tropic\r\nintensity. Had she known Boldwood\u2019s moods, her blame would have been\r\nfearful, and the stain upon her heart ineradicable. Moreover, had she\r\nknown her present power for good or evil over this man, she would have\r\ntrembled at her responsibility. Luckily for her present, unluckily for\r\nher future tranquillity, her understanding had not yet told her what\r\nBoldwood was. Nobody knew entirely; for though it was possible to form\r\nguesses concerning his wild capabilities from old floodmarks faintly\r\nvisible, he had never been seen at the high tides which caused them.\r\n\r\nFarmer Boldwood came to the stable-door and looked forth across the\r\nlevel fields. Beyond the first enclosure was a hedge, and on the other\r\nside of this a meadow belonging to Bathsheba\u2019s farm.\r\n\r\nIt was now early spring\u2014the time of going to grass with the sheep, when\r\nthey have the first feed of the meadows, before these are laid up for\r\nmowing. The wind, which had been blowing east for several weeks, had\r\nveered to the southward, and the middle of spring had come\r\nabruptly\u2014almost without a beginning. It was that period in the vernal\r\nquarter when we may suppose the Dryads to be waking for the season. The\r\nvegetable world begins to move and swell and the saps to rise, till in\r\nthe completest silence of lone gardens and trackless plantations, where\r\neverything seems helpless and still after the bond and slavery of\r\nfrost, there are bustlings, strainings, united thrusts, and\r\npulls-all-together, in comparison with which the powerful tugs of\r\ncranes and pulleys in a noisy city are but pigmy efforts.\r\n\r\nBoldwood, looking into the distant meadows, saw there three figures.\r\nThey were those of Miss Everdene, Shepherd Oak, and Cainy Ball.\r\n\r\nWhen Bathsheba\u2019s figure shone upon the farmer\u2019s eyes it lighted him up\r\nas the moon lights up a great tower. A man\u2019s body is as the shell, or\r\nthe tablet, of his soul, as he is reserved or ingenuous, overflowing or\r\nself-contained. There was a change in Boldwood\u2019s exterior from its\r\nformer impassibleness; and his face showed that he was now living\r\noutside his defences for the first time, and with a fearful sense of\r\nexposure. It is the usual experience of strong natures when they love.\r\n\r\nAt last he arrived at a conclusion. It was to go across and inquire\r\nboldly of her.\r\n\r\nThe insulation of his heart by reserve during these many years, without\r\na channel of any kind for disposable emotion, had worked its effect. It\r\nhas been observed more than once that the causes of love are chiefly\r\nsubjective, and Boldwood was a living testimony to the truth of the\r\nproposition. No mother existed to absorb his devotion, no sister for\r\nhis tenderness, no idle ties for sense. He became surcharged with the\r\ncompound, which was genuine lover\u2019s love.\r\n\r\nHe approached the gate of the meadow. Beyond it the ground was\r\nmelodious with ripples, and the sky with larks; the low bleating of the\r\nflock mingling with both. Mistress and man were engaged in the\r\noperation of making a lamb \u201Ctake,\u201D which is performed whenever an ewe\r\nhas lost her own offspring, one of the twins of another ewe being given\r\nher as a substitute. Gabriel had skinned the dead lamb, and was tying\r\nthe skin over the body of the live lamb, in the customary manner,\r\nwhilst Bathsheba was holding open a little pen of four hurdles, into\r\nwhich the mother and foisted lamb were driven, where they would remain\r\ntill the old sheep conceived an affection for the young one.\r\n\r\nBathsheba looked up at the completion of the man\u0153uvre and saw the\r\nfarmer by the gate, where he was overhung by a willow tree in full\r\nbloom. Gabriel, to whom her face was as the uncertain glory of an April\r\nday, was ever regardful of its faintest changes, and instantly\r\ndiscerned thereon the mark of some influence from without, in the form\r\nof a keenly self-conscious reddening. He also turned and beheld\r\nBoldwood.\r\n\r\nAt once connecting these signs with the letter Boldwood had shown him,\r\nGabriel suspected her of some coquettish procedure begun by that means,\r\nand carried on since, he knew not how.\r\n\r\nFarmer Boldwood had read the pantomime denoting that they were aware of\r\nhis presence, and the perception was as too much light turned upon his\r\nnew sensibility. He was still in the road, and by moving on he hoped\r\nthat neither would recognize that he had originally intended to enter\r\nthe field. He passed by with an utter and overwhelming sensation of\r\nignorance, shyness, and doubt. Perhaps in her manner there were signs\r\nthat she wished to see him\u2014perhaps not\u2014he could not read a woman. The\r\ncabala of this erotic philosophy seemed to consist of the subtlest\r\nmeanings expressed in misleading ways. Every turn, look, word, and\r\naccent contained a mystery quite distinct from its obvious import, and\r\nnot one had ever been pondered by him until now.\r\n\r\nAs for Bathsheba, she was not deceived into the belief that Farmer\r\nBoldwood had walked by on business or in idleness. She collected the\r\nprobabilities of the case, and concluded that she was herself\r\nresponsible for Boldwood\u2019s appearance there. It troubled her much to\r\nsee what a great flame a little wildfire was likely to kindle.\r\nBathsheba was no schemer for marriage, nor was she deliberately a\r\ntrifler with the affections of men, and a censor\u2019s experience on seeing\r\nan actual flirt after observing her would have been a feeling of\r\nsurprise that Bathsheba could be so different from such a one, and yet\r\nso like what a flirt is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nShe resolved never again, by look or by sign, to interrupt the steady\r\nflow of this man\u2019s life. But a resolution to avoid an evil is seldom\r\nframed till the evil is so far advanced as to make avoidance\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\nTHE SHEEP-WASHING\u2014THE OFFER\r\n\r\n\r\nBoldwood did eventually call upon her. She was not at home. \u201COf course\r\nnot,\u201D he murmured. In contemplating Bathsheba as a woman, he had\r\nforgotten the accidents of her position as an agriculturist\u2014that being\r\nas much of a farmer, and as extensive a farmer, as himself, her\r\nprobable whereabouts was out-of-doors at this time of the year. This,\r\nand the other oversights Boldwood was guilty of, were natural to the\r\nmood, and still more natural to the circumstances. The great aids to\r\nidealization in love were present here: occasional observation of her\r\nfrom a distance, and the absence of social intercourse with her\u2014visual\r\nfamiliarity, oral strangeness. The smaller human elements were kept out\r\nof sight; the pettinesses that enter so largely into all earthly living\r\nand doing were disguised by the accident of lover and loved-one not\r\nbeing on visiting terms; and there was hardly awakened a thought in\r\nBoldwood that sorry household realities appertained to her, or that\r\nshe, like all others, had moments of commonplace, when to be least\r\nplainly seen was to be most prettily remembered. Thus a mild sort of\r\napotheosis took place in his fancy, whilst she still lived and breathed\r\nwithin his own horizon, a troubled creature like himself.\r\n\r\nIt was the end of May when the farmer determined to be no longer\r\nrepulsed by trivialities or distracted by suspense. He had by this time\r\ngrown used to being in love; the passion now startled him less even\r\nwhen it tortured him more, and he felt himself adequate to the\r\nsituation. On inquiring for her at her house they had told him she was\r\nat the sheep-washing, and he went off to seek her there.\r\n\r\nThe sheep-washing pool was a perfectly circular basin of brickwork in\r\nthe meadows, full of the clearest water. To birds on the wing its\r\nglassy surface, reflecting the light sky, must have been visible for\r\nmiles around as a glistening Cyclops\u2019 eye in a green face. The grass\r\nabout the margin at this season was a sight to remember long\u2014in a minor\r\nsort of way. Its activity in sucking the moisture from the rich damp\r\nsod was almost a process observable by the eye. The outskirts of this\r\nlevel water-meadow were diversified by rounded and hollow pastures,\r\nwhere just now every flower that was not a buttercup was a daisy. The\r\nriver slid along noiselessly as a shade, the swelling reeds and sedge\r\nforming a flexible palisade upon its moist brink. To the north of the\r\nmead were trees, the leaves of which were new, soft, and moist, not yet\r\nhaving stiffened and darkened under summer sun and drought, their\r\ncolour being yellow beside a green\u2014green beside a yellow. From the\r\nrecesses of this knot of foliage the loud notes of three cuckoos were\r\nresounding through the still air.\r\n\r\nBoldwood went meditating down the slopes with his eyes on his boots,\r\nwhich the yellow pollen from the buttercups had bronzed in artistic\r\ngradations. A tributary of the main stream flowed through the basin of\r\nthe pool by an inlet and outlet at opposite points of its diameter.\r\nShepherd Oak, Jan Coggan, Moon, Poorgrass, Cain Ball, and several\r\nothers were assembled here, all dripping wet to the very roots of their\r\nhair, and Bathsheba was standing by in a new riding-habit\u2014the most\r\nelegant she had ever worn\u2014the reins of her horse being looped over her\r\narm. Flagons of cider were rolling about upon the green. The meek sheep\r\nwere pushed into the pool by Coggan and Matthew Moon, who stood by the\r\nlower hatch, immersed to their waists; then Gabriel, who stood on the\r\nbrink, thrust them under as they swam along, with an instrument like a\r\ncrutch, formed for the purpose, and also for assisting the exhausted\r\nanimals when the wool became saturated and they began to sink. They\r\nwere let out against the stream, and through the upper opening, all\r\nimpurities flowing away below. Cainy Ball and Joseph, who performed\r\nthis latter operation, were if possible wetter than the rest; they\r\nresembled dolphins under a fountain, every protuberance and angle of\r\ntheir clothes dribbling forth a small rill.\r\n\r\nBoldwood came close and bade her good morning, with such constraint\r\nthat she could not but think he had stepped across to the washing for\r\nits own sake, hoping not to find her there; more, she fancied his brow\r\nsevere and his eye slighting. Bathsheba immediately contrived to\r\nwithdraw, and glided along by the river till she was a stone\u2019s throw\r\noff. She heard footsteps brushing the grass, and had a consciousness\r\nthat love was encircling her like a perfume. Instead of turning or\r\nwaiting, Bathsheba went further among the high sedges, but Boldwood\r\nseemed determined, and pressed on till they were completely past the\r\nbend of the river. Here, without being seen, they could hear the\r\nsplashing and shouts of the washers above.\r\n\r\n\u201CMiss Everdene!\u201D said the farmer.\r\n\r\nShe trembled, turned, and said \u201CGood morning.\u201D His tone was so utterly\r\nremoved from all she had expected as a beginning. It was lowness and\r\nquiet accentuated: an emphasis of deep meanings, their form, at the\r\nsame time, being scarcely expressed. Silence has sometimes a remarkable\r\npower of showing itself as the disembodied soul of feeling wandering\r\nwithout its carcase, and it is then more impressive than speech. In the\r\nsame way, to say a little is often to tell more than to say a great\r\ndeal. Boldwood told everything in that word.\r\n\r\nAs the consciousness expands on learning that what was fancied to be\r\nthe rumble of wheels is the reverberation of thunder, so did\r\nBathsheba\u2019s at her intuitive conviction.\r\n\r\n\u201CI feel\u2014almost too much\u2014to think,\u201D he said, with a solemn simplicity.\r\n\u201CI have come to speak to you without preface. My life is not my own\r\nsince I have beheld you clearly, Miss Everdene\u2014I come to make you an\r\noffer of marriage.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba tried to preserve an absolutely neutral countenance, and all\r\nthe motion she made was that of closing lips which had previously been\r\na little parted.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am now forty-one years old,\u201D he went on. \u201CI may have been called a\r\nconfirmed bachelor, and I was a confirmed bachelor. I had never any\r\nviews of myself as a husband in my earlier days, nor have I made any\r\ncalculation on the subject since I have been older. But we all change,\r\nand my change, in this matter, came with seeing you. I have felt\r\nlately, more and more, that my present way of living is bad in every\r\nrespect. Beyond all things, I want you as my wife.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI feel, Mr. Boldwood, that though I respect you much, I do not\r\nfeel\u2014what would justify me to\u2014in accepting your offer,\u201D she stammered.\r\n\r\nThis giving back of dignity for dignity seemed to open the sluices of\r\nfeeling that Boldwood had as yet kept closed.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy life is a burden without you,\u201D he exclaimed, in a low voice. \u201CI\r\nwant you\u2014I want you to let me say I love you again and again!\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba answered nothing, and the horse upon her arm seemed so\r\nimpressed that instead of cropping the herbage she looked up.\r\n\r\n\u201CI think and hope you care enough for me to listen to what I have to\r\ntell!\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba\u2019s momentary impulse at hearing this was to ask why he thought\r\nthat, till she remembered that, far from being a conceited assumption\r\non Boldwood\u2019s part, it was but the natural conclusion of serious\r\nreflection based on deceptive premises of her own offering.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish I could say courteous flatteries to you,\u201D the farmer continued\r\nin an easier tone, \u201Cand put my rugged feeling into a graceful shape:\r\nbut I have neither power nor patience to learn such things. I want you\r\nfor my wife\u2014so wildly that no other feeling can abide in me; but I\r\nshould not have spoken out had I not been led to hope.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe valentine again! O that valentine!\u201D she said to herself, but not a\r\nword to him.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you can love me say so, Miss Everdene. If not\u2014don\u2019t say no!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMr. Boldwood, it is painful to have to say I am surprised, so that I\r\ndon\u2019t know how to answer you with propriety and respect\u2014but am only\r\njust able to speak out my feeling\u2014I mean my meaning; that I am afraid I\r\ncan\u2019t marry you, much as I respect you. You are too dignified for me to\r\nsuit you, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut, Miss Everdene!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2014I didn\u2019t\u2014I know I ought never to have dreamt of sending that\r\nvalentine\u2014forgive me, sir\u2014it was a wanton thing which no woman with any\r\nself-respect should have done. If you will only pardon my\r\nthoughtlessness, I promise never to\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, no. Don\u2019t say thoughtlessness! Make me think it was something\r\nmore\u2014that it was a sort of prophetic instinct\u2014the beginning of a\r\nfeeling that you would like me. You torture me to say it was done in\r\nthoughtlessness\u2014I never thought of it in that light, and I can\u2019t endure\r\nit. Ah! I wish I knew how to win you! but that I can\u2019t do\u2014I can only\r\nask if I have already got you. If I have not, and it is not true that\r\nyou have come unwittingly to me as I have to you, I can say no more.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have not fallen in love with you, Mr. Boldwood\u2014certainly I must say\r\nthat.\u201D She allowed a very small smile to creep for the first time over\r\nher serious face in saying this, and the white row of upper teeth, and\r\nkeenly-cut lips already noticed, suggested an idea of heartlessness,\r\nwhich was immediately contradicted by the pleasant eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you will just think\u2014in kindness and condescension think\u2014if you\r\ncannot bear with me as a husband! I fear I am too old for you, but\r\nbelieve me I will take more care of you than would many a man of your\r\nown age. I will protect and cherish you with all my strength\u2014I will\r\nindeed! You shall have no cares\u2014be worried by no household affairs, and\r\nlive quite at ease, Miss Everdene. The dairy superintendence shall be\r\ndone by a man\u2014I can afford it well\u2014you shall never have so much as to\r\nlook out of doors at haymaking time, or to think of weather in the\r\nharvest. I rather cling to the chaise, because it is the same my poor\r\nfather and mother drove, but if you don\u2019t like it I will sell it, and\r\nyou shall have a pony-carriage of your own. I cannot say how far above\r\nevery other idea and object on earth you seem to me\u2014nobody knows\u2014God\r\nonly knows\u2014how much you are to me!\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba\u2019s heart was young, and it swelled with sympathy for the\r\ndeep-natured man who spoke so simply.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t say it! don\u2019t! I cannot bear you to feel so much, and me to feel\r\nnothing. And I am afraid they will notice us, Mr. Boldwood. Will you\r\nlet the matter rest now? I cannot think collectedly. I did not know you\r\nwere going to say this to me. Oh, I am wicked to have made you suffer\r\nso!\u201D She was frightened as well as agitated at his vehemence.\r\n\r\n\u201CSay then, that you don\u2019t absolutely refuse. Do not quite refuse?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can do nothing. I cannot answer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI may speak to you again on the subject?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI may think of you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I suppose you may think of me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd hope to obtain you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo\u2014do not hope! Let us go on.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will call upon you again to-morrow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo\u2014please not. Give me time.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014I will give you any time,\u201D he said earnestly and gratefully. \u201CI am\r\nhappier now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo\u2014I beg you! Don\u2019t be happier if happiness only comes from my\r\nagreeing. Be neutral, Mr. Boldwood! I must think.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will wait,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nAnd then she turned away. Boldwood dropped his gaze to the ground, and\r\nstood long like a man who did not know where he was. Realities then\r\nreturned upon him like the pain of a wound received in an excitement\r\nwhich eclipses it, and he, too, then went on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\nPERPLEXITY\u2014GRINDING THE SHEARS\u2014A QUARREL\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is so disinterested and kind to offer me all that I can desire,\u201D\r\nBathsheba mused.\r\n\r\nYet Farmer Boldwood, whether by nature kind or the reverse to kind, did\r\nnot exercise kindness here. The rarest offerings of the purest loves\r\nare but a self-indulgence, and no generosity at all.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, not being the least in love with him, was eventually able to\r\nlook calmly at his offer. It was one which many women of her own\r\nstation in the neighbourhood, and not a few of higher rank, would have\r\nbeen wild to accept and proud to publish. In every point of view,\r\nranging from politic to passionate, it was desirable that she, a lonely\r\ngirl, should marry, and marry this earnest, well-to-do, and respected\r\nman. He was close to her doors: his standing was sufficient: his\r\nqualities were even supererogatory. Had she felt, which she did not,\r\nany wish whatever for the married state in the abstract, she could not\r\nreasonably have rejected him, being a woman who frequently appealed to\r\nher understanding for deliverance from her whims. Boldwood as a means\r\nto marriage was unexceptionable: she esteemed and liked him, yet she\r\ndid not want him. It appears that ordinary men take wives because\r\npossession is not possible without marriage, and that ordinary women\r\naccept husbands because marriage is not possible without possession;\r\nwith totally differing aims the method is the same on both sides. But\r\nthe understood incentive on the woman\u2019s part was wanting here. Besides,\r\nBathsheba\u2019s position as absolute mistress of a farm and house was a\r\nnovel one, and the novelty had not yet begun to wear off.\r\n\r\nBut a disquiet filled her which was somewhat to her credit, for it\r\nwould have affected few. Beyond the mentioned reasons with which she\r\ncombated her objections, she had a strong feeling that, having been the\r\none who began the game, she ought in honesty to accept the\r\nconsequences. Still the reluctance remained. She said in the same\r\nbreath that it would be ungenerous not to marry Boldwood, and that she\r\ncouldn\u2019t do it to save her life.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\u2019s was an impulsive nature under a deliberative aspect. An\r\nElizabeth in brain and a Mary Stuart in spirit, she often performed\r\nactions of the greatest temerity with a manner of extreme discretion.\r\nMany of her thoughts were perfect syllogisms; unluckily they always\r\nremained thoughts. Only a few were irrational assumptions; but,\r\nunfortunately, they were the ones which most frequently grew into\r\ndeeds.\r\n\r\nThe next day to that of the declaration she found Gabriel Oak at the\r\nbottom of her garden, grinding his shears for the sheep-shearing. All\r\nthe surrounding cottages were more or less scenes of the same\r\noperation; the scurr of whetting spread into the sky from all parts of\r\nthe village as from an armoury previous to a campaign. Peace and war\r\nkiss each other at their hours of preparation\u2014sickles, scythes, shears,\r\nand pruning-hooks, ranking with swords, bayonets, and lances, in their\r\ncommon necessity for point and edge.\r\n\r\nCainy Ball turned the handle of Gabriel\u2019s grindstone, his head\r\nperforming a melancholy see-saw up and down with each turn of the\r\nwheel. Oak stood somewhat as Eros is represented when in the act of\r\nsharpening his arrows: his figure slightly bent, the weight of his body\r\nthrown over on the shears, and his head balanced side-ways, with a\r\ncritical compression of the lips and contraction of the eyelids to\r\ncrown the attitude.\r\n\r\nHis mistress came up and looked upon them in silence for a minute or\r\ntwo; then she said\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CCain, go to the lower mead and catch the bay mare. I\u2019ll turn the winch\r\nof the grindstone. I want to speak to you, Gabriel.\u201D\r\n\r\nCain departed, and Bathsheba took the handle. Gabriel had glanced up in\r\nintense surprise, quelled its expression, and looked down again.\r\nBathsheba turned the winch, and Gabriel applied the shears.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar motion involved in turning a wheel has a wonderful\r\ntendency to benumb the mind. It is a sort of attenuated variety of\r\nIxion\u2019s punishment, and contributes a dismal chapter to the history of\r\ngaols. The brain gets muddled, the head grows heavy, and the body\u2019s\r\ncentre of gravity seems to settle by degrees in a leaden lump somewhere\r\nbetween the eyebrows and the crown. Bathsheba felt the unpleasant\r\nsymptoms after two or three dozen turns.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you turn, Gabriel, and let me hold the shears?\u201D she said. \u201CMy\r\nhead is in a whirl, and I can\u2019t talk.\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel turned. Bathsheba then began, with some awkwardness, allowing\r\nher thoughts to stray occasionally from her story to attend to the\r\nshears, which required a little nicety in sharpening.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wanted to ask you if the men made any observations on my going\r\nbehind the sedge with Mr. Boldwood yesterday?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, they did,\u201D said Gabriel. \u201CYou don\u2019t hold the shears right, miss\u2014I\r\nknew you wouldn\u2019t know the way\u2014hold like this.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe relinquished the winch, and inclosing her two hands completely in\r\nhis own (taking each as we sometimes slap a child\u2019s hand in teaching\r\nhim to write), grasped the shears with her. \u201CIncline the edge so,\u201D he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHands and shears were inclined to suit the words, and held thus for a\r\npeculiarly long time by the instructor as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat will do,\u201D exclaimed Bathsheba. \u201CLoose my hands. I won\u2019t have them\r\nheld! Turn the winch.\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel freed her hands quietly, retired to his handle, and the\r\ngrinding went on.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid the men think it odd?\u201D she said again.\r\n\r\n\u201COdd was not the idea, miss.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat did they say?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat Farmer Boldwood\u2019s name and your own were likely to be flung over\r\npulpit together before the year was out.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI thought so by the look of them! Why, there\u2019s nothing in it. A more\r\nfoolish remark was never made, and I want you to contradict it: that\u2019s\r\nwhat I came for.\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel looked incredulous and sad, but between his moments of\r\nincredulity, relieved.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey must have heard our conversation,\u201D she continued.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, then, Bathsheba!\u201D said Oak, stopping the handle, and gazing into\r\nher face with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201CMiss Everdene, you mean,\u201D she said, with dignity.\r\n\r\n\u201CI mean this, that if Mr. Boldwood really spoke of marriage, I bain\u2019t\r\ngoing to tell a story and say he didn\u2019t to please you. I have already\r\ntried to please you too much for my own good!\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba regarded him with round-eyed perplexity. She did not know\r\nwhether to pity him for disappointed love of her, or to be angry with\r\nhim for having got over it\u2014his tone being ambiguous.\r\n\r\n\u201CI said I wanted you just to mention that it was not true I was going\r\nto be married to him,\u201D she murmured, with a slight decline in her\r\nassurance.\r\n\r\n\u201CI can say that to them if you wish, Miss Everdene. And I could\r\nlikewise give an opinion to \u2019ee on what you have done.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI daresay. But I don\u2019t want your opinion.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI suppose not,\u201D said Gabriel bitterly, and going on with his turning,\r\nhis words rising and falling in a regular swell and cadence as he\r\nstooped or rose with the winch, which directed them, according to his\r\nposition, perpendicularly into the earth, or horizontally along the\r\ngarden, his eyes being fixed on a leaf upon the ground.\r\n\r\nWith Bathsheba a hastened act was a rash act; but, as does not always\r\nhappen, time gained was prudence insured. It must be added, however,\r\nthat time was very seldom gained. At this period the single opinion in\r\nthe parish on herself and her doings that she valued as sounder than\r\nher own was Gabriel Oak\u2019s. And the outspoken honesty of his character\r\nwas such that on any subject, even that of her love for, or marriage\r\nwith, another man, the same disinterestedness of opinion might be\r\ncalculated on, and be had for the asking. Thoroughly convinced of the\r\nimpossibility of his own suit, a high resolve constrained him not to\r\ninjure that of another. This is a lover\u2019s most stoical virtue, as the\r\nlack of it is a lover\u2019s most venial sin. Knowing he would reply truly\r\nshe asked the question, painful as she must have known the subject\r\nwould be. Such is the selfishness of some charming women. Perhaps it\r\nwas some excuse for her thus torturing honesty to her own advantage,\r\nthat she had absolutely no other sound judgment within easy reach.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, what is your opinion of my conduct,\u201D she said, quietly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat it is unworthy of any thoughtful, and meek, and comely woman.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn an instant Bathsheba\u2019s face coloured with the angry crimson of a\r\nDanby sunset. But she forbore to utter this feeling, and the reticence\r\nof her tongue only made the loquacity of her face the more noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe next thing Gabriel did was to make a mistake.\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps you don\u2019t like the rudeness of my reprimanding you, for I know\r\nit is rudeness; but I thought it would do good.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe instantly replied sarcastically\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201COn the contrary, my opinion of you is so low, that I see in your abuse\r\nthe praise of discerning people!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am glad you don\u2019t mind it, for I said it honestly and with every\r\nserious meaning.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI see. But, unfortunately, when you try not to speak in jest you are\r\namusing\u2014just as when you wish to avoid seriousness you sometimes say a\r\nsensible word.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was a hard hit, but Bathsheba had unmistakably lost her temper, and\r\non that account Gabriel had never in his life kept his own better. He\r\nsaid nothing. She then broke out\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CI may ask, I suppose, where in particular my unworthiness lies? In my\r\nnot marrying you, perhaps!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot by any means,\u201D said Gabriel quietly. \u201CI have long given up\r\nthinking of that matter.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COr wishing it, I suppose,\u201D she said; and it was apparent that she\r\nexpected an unhesitating denial of this supposition.\r\n\r\nWhatever Gabriel felt, he coolly echoed her words\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201COr wishing it either.\u201D\r\n\r\nA woman may be treated with a bitterness which is sweet to her, and\r\nwith a rudeness which is not offensive. Bathsheba would have submitted\r\nto an indignant chastisement for her levity had Gabriel protested that\r\nhe was loving her at the same time; the impetuosity of passion\r\nunrequited is bearable, even if it stings and anathematizes\u2014there is a\r\ntriumph in the humiliation, and a tenderness in the strife. This was\r\nwhat she had been expecting, and what she had not got. To be lectured\r\nbecause the lecturer saw her in the cold morning light of\r\nopen-shuttered disillusion was exasperating. He had not finished,\r\neither. He continued in a more agitated voice:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CMy opinion is (since you ask it) that you are greatly to blame for\r\nplaying pranks upon a man like Mr. Boldwood, merely as a pastime.\r\nLeading on a man you don\u2019t care for is not a praiseworthy action. And\r\neven, Miss Everdene, if you seriously inclined towards him, you might\r\nhave let him find it out in some way of true loving-kindness, and not\r\nby sending him a valentine\u2019s letter.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba laid down the shears.\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot allow any man to\u2014to criticise my private conduct!\u201D she\r\nexclaimed. \u201CNor will I for a minute. So you\u2019ll please leave the farm at\r\nthe end of the week!\u201D\r\n\r\nIt may have been a peculiarity\u2014at any rate it was a fact\u2014that when\r\nBathsheba was swayed by an emotion of an earthly sort her lower lip\r\ntrembled: when by a refined emotion, her upper or heavenward one. Her\r\nnether lip quivered now.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well, so I will,\u201D said Gabriel calmly. He had been held to her by\r\na beautiful thread which it pained him to spoil by breaking, rather\r\nthan by a chain he could not break. \u201CI should be even better pleased to\r\ngo at once,\u201D he added.\r\n\r\n\u201CGo at once then, in Heaven\u2019s name!\u201D said she, her eyes flashing at\r\nhis, though never meeting them. \u201CDon\u2019t let me see your face any more.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well, Miss Everdene\u2014so it shall be.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd he took his shears and went away from her in placid dignity, as\r\nMoses left the presence of Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\nTROUBLES IN THE FOLD\u2014A MESSAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nGabriel Oak had ceased to feed the Weatherbury flock for about\r\nfour-and-twenty hours, when on Sunday afternoon the elderly gentlemen\r\nJoseph Poorgrass, Matthew Moon, Fray, and half-a-dozen others, came\r\nrunning up to the house of the mistress of the Upper Farm.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhatever _is_ the matter, men?\u201D she said, meeting them at the door\r\njust as she was coming out on her way to church, and ceasing in a\r\nmoment from the close compression of her two red lips, with which she\r\nhad accompanied the exertion of pulling on a tight glove.\r\n\r\n\u201CSixty!\u201D said Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\n\u201CSeventy!\u201D said Moon.\r\n\r\n\u201CFifty-nine!\u201D said Susan Tall\u2019s husband.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014Sheep have broke fence,\u201D said Fray.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014And got into a field of young clover,\u201D said Tall.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014Young clover!\u201D said Moon.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014Clover!\u201D said Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd they be getting blasted,\u201D said Henery Fray.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat they be,\u201D said Joseph.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd will all die as dead as nits, if they bain\u2019t got out and cured!\u201D\r\nsaid Tall.\r\n\r\nJoseph\u2019s countenance was drawn into lines and puckers by his concern.\r\nFray\u2019s forehead was wrinkled both perpendicularly and crosswise, after\r\nthe pattern of a portcullis, expressive of a double despair. Laban\r\nTall\u2019s lips were thin, and his face was rigid. Matthew\u2019s jaws sank, and\r\nhis eyes turned whichever way the strongest muscle happened to pull\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Joseph, \u201Cand I was sitting at home, looking for Ephesians,\r\nand says I to myself, \u2018\u2019Tis nothing but Corinthians and Thessalonians\r\nin this danged Testament,\u2019 when who should come in but Henery there:\r\n\u2018Joseph,\u2019 he said, \u2018the sheep have blasted theirselves\u2014\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\nWith Bathsheba it was a moment when thought was speech and speech\r\nexclamation. Moreover, she had hardly recovered her equanimity since\r\nthe disturbance which she had suffered from Oak\u2019s remarks.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s enough\u2014that\u2019s enough!\u2014oh, you fools!\u201D she cried, throwing the\r\nparasol and Prayer-book into the passage, and running out of doors in\r\nthe direction signified. \u201CTo come to me, and not go and get them out\r\ndirectly! Oh, the stupid numskulls!\u201D\r\n\r\nHer eyes were at their darkest and brightest now. Bathsheba\u2019s beauty\r\nbelonging rather to the demonian than to the angelic school, she never\r\nlooked so well as when she was angry\u2014and particularly when the effect\r\nwas heightened by a rather dashing velvet dress, carefully put on\r\nbefore a glass.\r\n\r\nAll the ancient men ran in a jumbled throng after her to the\r\nclover-field, Joseph sinking down in the midst when about half-way,\r\nlike an individual withering in a world which was more and more\r\ninsupportable. Having once received the stimulus that her presence\r\nalways gave them they went round among the sheep with a will. The\r\nmajority of the afflicted animals were lying down, and could not be\r\nstirred. These were bodily lifted out, and the others driven into the\r\nadjoining field. Here, after the lapse of a few minutes, several more\r\nfell down, and lay helpless and livid as the rest.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, with a sad, bursting heart, looked at these primest\r\nspecimens of her prime flock as they rolled there\u2014\r\n\r\nSwoln with wind and the rank mist they drew.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of them foamed at the mouth, their breathing being quick and\r\nshort, whilst the bodies of all were fearfully distended.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, what can I do, what can I do!\u201D said Bathsheba, helplessly. \u201CSheep\r\nare such unfortunate animals!\u2014there\u2019s always something happening to\r\nthem! I never knew a flock pass a year without getting into some scrape\r\nor other.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s only one way of saving them,\u201D said Tall.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat way? Tell me quick!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey must be pierced in the side with a thing made on purpose.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCan you do it? Can I?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, ma\u2019am. We can\u2019t, nor you neither. It must be done in a particular\r\nspot. If ye go to the right or left but an inch you stab the ewe and\r\nkill her. Not even a shepherd can do it, as a rule.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen they must die,\u201D she said, in a resigned tone.\r\n\r\n\u201COnly one man in the neighbourhood knows the way,\u201D said Joseph, now\r\njust come up. \u201CHe could cure \u2019em all if he were here.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho is he? Let\u2019s get him!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShepherd Oak,\u201D said Matthew. \u201CAh, he\u2019s a clever man in talents!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, that he is so!\u201D said Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue\u2014he\u2019s the man,\u201D said Laban Tall.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow dare you name that man in my presence!\u201D she said excitedly. \u201CI\r\ntold you never to allude to him, nor shall you if you stay with me.\r\nAh!\u201D she added, brightening, \u201CFarmer Boldwood knows!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CO no, ma\u2019am\u201D said Matthew. \u201CTwo of his store ewes got into some\r\nvetches t\u2019other day, and were just like these. He sent a man on\r\nhorseback here post-haste for Gable, and Gable went and saved \u2019em.\r\nFarmer Boldwood hev got the thing they do it with. \u2019Tis a holler pipe,\r\nwith a sharp pricker inside. Isn\u2019t it, Joseph?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy\u2014a holler pipe,\u201D echoed Joseph. \u201CThat\u2019s what \u2019tis.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, sure\u2014that\u2019s the machine,\u201D chimed in Henery Fray, reflectively,\r\nwith an Oriental indifference to the flight of time.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D burst out Bathsheba, \u201Cdon\u2019t stand there with your \u2018ayes\u2019 and\r\nyour \u2018sures\u2019 talking at me! Get somebody to cure the sheep instantly!\u201D\r\n\r\nAll then stalked off in consternation, to get somebody as directed,\r\nwithout any idea of who it was to be. In a minute they had vanished\r\nthrough the gate, and she stood alone with the dying flock.\r\n\r\n\u201CNever will I send for him\u2014never!\u201D she said firmly.\r\n\r\nOne of the ewes here contracted its muscles horribly, extended itself,\r\nand jumped high into the air. The leap was an astonishing one. The ewe\r\nfell heavily, and lay still.\r\n\r\nBathsheba went up to it. The sheep was dead.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, what shall I do\u2014what shall I do!\u201D she again exclaimed, wringing\r\nher hands. \u201CI won\u2019t send for him. No, I won\u2019t!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe most vigorous expression of a resolution does not always coincide\r\nwith the greatest vigour of the resolution itself. It is often flung\r\nout as a sort of prop to support a decaying conviction which, whilst\r\nstrong, required no enunciation to prove it so. The \u201CNo, I won\u2019t\u201D of\r\nBathsheba meant virtually, \u201CI think I must.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe followed her assistants through the gate, and lifted her hand to\r\none of them. Laban answered to her signal.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere is Oak staying?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAcross the valley at Nest Cottage!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CJump on the bay mare, and ride across, and say he must return\r\ninstantly\u2014that I say so.\u201D\r\n\r\nTall scrambled off to the field, and in two minutes was on Poll, the\r\nbay, bare-backed, and with only a halter by way of rein. He diminished\r\ndown the hill.\r\n\r\nBathsheba watched. So did all the rest. Tall cantered along the\r\nbridle-path through Sixteen Acres, Sheeplands, Middle Field, The Flats,\r\nCappel\u2019s Piece, shrank almost to a point, crossed the bridge, and\r\nascended from the valley through Springmead and Whitepits on the other\r\nside. The cottage to which Gabriel had retired before taking his final\r\ndeparture from the locality was visible as a white spot on the opposite\r\nhill, backed by blue firs. Bathsheba walked up and down. The men\r\nentered the field and endeavoured to ease the anguish of the dumb\r\ncreatures by rubbing them. Nothing availed.\r\n\r\nBathsheba continued walking. The horse was seen descending the hill,\r\nand the wearisome series had to be repeated in reverse order:\r\nWhitepits, Springmead, Cappel\u2019s Piece, The Flats, Middle Field,\r\nSheeplands, Sixteen Acres. She hoped Tall had had presence of mind\r\nenough to give the mare up to Gabriel, and return himself on foot. The\r\nrider neared them. It was Tall.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, what folly!\u201D said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nGabriel was not visible anywhere.\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps he is already gone!\u201D she said.\r\n\r\nTall came into the inclosure, and leapt off, his face tragic as\r\nMorton\u2019s after the battle of Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell?\u201D said Bathsheba, unwilling to believe that her verbal\r\n_lettre-de-cachet_ could possibly have miscarried.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe says _beggars mustn\u2019t be choosers_,\u201D replied Laban.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat!\u201D said the young farmer, opening her eyes and drawing in her\r\nbreath for an outburst. Joseph Poorgrass retired a few steps behind a\r\nhurdle.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe says he shall not come onless you request en to come civilly and in\r\na proper manner, as becomes any \u2019ooman begging a favour.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, oh, that\u2019s his answer! Where does he get his airs? Who am I, then,\r\nto be treated like that? Shall I beg to a man who has begged to me?\u201D\r\n\r\nAnother of the flock sprang into the air, and fell dead.\r\n\r\nThe men looked grave, as if they suppressed opinion.\r\n\r\nBathsheba turned aside, her eyes full of tears. The strait she was in\r\nthrough pride and shrewishness could not be disguised longer: she burst\r\nout crying bitterly; they all saw it; and she attempted no further\r\nconcealment.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t cry about it, miss,\u201D said William Smallbury,\r\ncompassionately. \u201CWhy not ask him softer like? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d come then.\r\nGable is a true man in that way.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba checked her grief and wiped her eyes. \u201COh, it is a wicked\r\ncruelty to me\u2014it is\u2014it is!\u201D she murmured. \u201CAnd he drives me to do what\r\nI wouldn\u2019t; yes, he does!\u2014Tall, come indoors.\u201D\r\n\r\nAfter this collapse, not very dignified for the head of an\r\nestablishment, she went into the house, Tall at her heels. Here she sat\r\ndown and hastily scribbled a note between the small convulsive sobs of\r\nconvalescence which follow a fit of crying as a ground-swell follows a\r\nstorm. The note was none the less polite for being written in a hurry.\r\nShe held it at a distance, was about to fold it, then added these words\r\nat the bottom:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201C_Do not desert me, Gabriel!_\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nShe looked a little redder in refolding it, and closed her lips, as if\r\nthereby to suspend till too late the action of conscience in examining\r\nwhether such strategy were justifiable. The note was despatched as the\r\nmessage had been, and Bathsheba waited indoors for the result.\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious quarter of an hour that intervened between the\r\nmessenger\u2019s departure and the sound of the horse\u2019s tramp again outside.\r\nShe could not watch this time, but, leaning over the old bureau at\r\nwhich she had written the letter, closed her eyes, as if to keep out\r\nboth hope and fear.\r\n\r\nThe case, however, was a promising one. Gabriel was not angry: he was\r\nsimply neutral, although her first command had been so haughty. Such\r\nimperiousness would have damned a little less beauty; and on the other\r\nhand, such beauty would have redeemed a little less imperiousness.\r\n\r\nShe went out when the horse was heard, and looked up. A mounted figure\r\npassed between her and the sky, and drew on towards the field of sheep,\r\nthe rider turning his face in receding. Gabriel looked at her. It was a\r\nmoment when a woman\u2019s eyes and tongue tell distinctly opposite tales.\r\nBathsheba looked full of gratitude, and she said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Gabriel, how could you serve me so unkindly!\u201D\r\n\r\nSuch a tenderly-shaped reproach for his previous delay was the one\r\nspeech in the language that he could pardon for not being commendation\r\nof his readiness now.\r\n\r\nGabriel murmured a confused reply, and hastened on. She knew from the\r\nlook which sentence in her note had brought him. Bathsheba followed to\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nGabriel was already among the turgid, prostrate forms. He had flung off\r\nhis coat, rolled up his shirt-sleeves, and taken from his pocket the\r\ninstrument of salvation. It was a small tube or trochar, with a lance\r\npassing down the inside; and Gabriel began to use it with a dexterity\r\nthat would have graced a hospital surgeon. Passing his hand over the\r\nsheep\u2019s left flank, and selecting the proper point, he punctured the\r\nskin and rumen with the lance as it stood in the tube; then he suddenly\r\nwithdrew the lance, retaining the tube in its place. A current of air\r\nrushed up the tube, forcible enough to have extinguished a candle held\r\nat the orifice.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that mere ease after torment is delight for a time;\r\nand the countenances of these poor creatures expressed it now.\r\nForty-nine operations were successfully performed. Owing to the great\r\nhurry necessitated by the far-gone state of some of the flock, Gabriel\r\nmissed his aim in one case, and in one only\u2014striking wide of the mark,\r\nand inflicting a mortal blow at once upon the suffering ewe. Four had\r\ndied; three recovered without an operation. The total number of sheep\r\nwhich had thus strayed and injured themselves so dangerously was\r\nfifty-seven.\r\n\r\nWhen the love-led man had ceased from his labours, Bathsheba came and\r\nlooked him in the face.\r\n\r\n\u201CGabriel, will you stay on with me?\u201D she said, smiling winningly, and\r\nnot troubling to bring her lips quite together again at the end,\r\nbecause there was going to be another smile soon.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will,\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\nAnd she smiled on him again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\nTHE GREAT BARN AND THE SHEEP-SHEARERS\r\n\r\n\r\nMen thin away to insignificance and oblivion quite as often by not\r\nmaking the most of good spirits when they have them as by lacking good\r\nspirits when they are indispensable. Gabriel lately, for the first time\r\nsince his prostration by misfortune, had been independent in thought\r\nand vigorous in action to a marked extent\u2014conditions which, powerless\r\nwithout an opportunity as an opportunity without them is barren, would\r\nhave given him a sure lift upwards when the favourable conjunction\r\nshould have occurred. But this incurable loitering beside Bathsheba\r\nEverdene stole his time ruinously. The spring tides were going by\r\nwithout floating him off, and the neap might soon come which could not.\r\n\r\nIt was the first day of June, and the sheep-shearing season culminated,\r\nthe landscape, even to the leanest pasture, being all health and\r\ncolour. Every green was young, every pore was open, and every stalk was\r\nswollen with racing currents of juice. God was palpably present in the\r\ncountry, and the devil had gone with the world to town. Flossy catkins\r\nof the later kinds, fern-sprouts like bishops\u2019 croziers, the\r\nsquare-headed moschatel, the odd cuckoo-pint,\u2014like an apoplectic saint\r\nin a niche of malachite,\u2014snow-white ladies\u2019-smocks, the toothwort,\r\napproximating to human flesh, the enchanter\u2019s night-shade, and the\r\nblack-petaled doleful-bells, were among the quainter objects of the\r\nvegetable world in and about Weatherbury at this teeming time; and of\r\nthe animal, the metamorphosed figures of Mr. Jan Coggan, the\r\nmaster-shearer; the second and third shearers, who travelled in the\r\nexercise of their calling, and do not require definition by name;\r\nHenery Fray the fourth shearer, Susan Tall\u2019s husband the fifth, Joseph\r\nPoorgrass the sixth, young Cain Ball as assistant-shearer, and Gabriel\r\nOak as general supervisor. None of these were clothed to any extent\r\nworth mentioning, each appearing to have hit in the matter of raiment\r\nthe decent mean between a high and low caste Hindoo. An angularity of\r\nlineament, and a fixity of facial machinery in general, proclaimed that\r\nserious work was the order of the day.\r\n\r\nThey sheared in the great barn, called for the nonce the Shearing-barn,\r\nwhich on ground-plan resembled a church with transepts. It not only\r\nemulated the form of the neighbouring church of the parish, but vied\r\nwith it in antiquity. Whether the barn had ever formed one of a group\r\nof conventual buildings nobody seemed to be aware; no trace of such\r\nsurroundings remained. The vast porches at the sides, lofty enough to\r\nadmit a waggon laden to its highest with corn in the sheaf, were\r\nspanned by heavy-pointed arches of stone, broadly and boldly cut, whose\r\nvery simplicity was the origin of a grandeur not apparent in erections\r\nwhere more ornament has been attempted. The dusky, filmed, chestnut\r\nroof, braced and tied in by huge collars, curves, and diagonals, was\r\nfar nobler in design, because more wealthy in material, than\r\nnine-tenths of those in our modern churches. Along each side wall was a\r\nrange of striding buttresses, throwing deep shadows on the spaces\r\nbetween them, which were perforated by lancet openings, combining in\r\ntheir proportions the precise requirements both of beauty and\r\nventilation.\r\n\r\nOne could say about this barn, what could hardly be said of either the\r\nchurch or the castle, akin to it in age and style, that the purpose\r\nwhich had dictated its original erection was the same with that to\r\nwhich it was still applied. Unlike and superior to either of those two\r\ntypical remnants of medi\u00E6valism, the old barn embodied practices which\r\nhad suffered no mutilation at the hands of time. Here at least the\r\nspirit of the ancient builders was at one with the spirit of the modern\r\nbeholder. Standing before this abraded pile, the eye regarded its\r\npresent usage, the mind dwelt upon its past history, with a satisfied\r\nsense of functional continuity throughout\u2014a feeling almost of\r\ngratitude, and quite of pride, at the permanence of the idea which had\r\nheaped it up. The fact that four centuries had neither proved it to be\r\nfounded on a mistake, inspired any hatred of its purpose, nor given\r\nrise to any reaction that had battered it down, invested this simple\r\ngrey effort of old minds with a repose, if not a grandeur, which a too\r\ncurious reflection was apt to disturb in its ecclesiastical and\r\nmilitary compeers. For once medi\u00E6valism and modernism had a common\r\nstand-point. The lanceolate windows, the time-eaten archstones and\r\nchamfers, the orientation of the axis, the misty chestnut work of the\r\nrafters, referred to no exploded fortifying art or worn-out religious\r\ncreed. The defence and salvation of the body by daily bread is still a\r\nstudy, a religion, and a desire.\r\n\r\nTo-day the large side doors were thrown open towards the sun to admit a\r\nbountiful light to the immediate spot of the shearers\u2019 operations,\r\nwhich was the wood threshing-floor in the centre, formed of thick oak,\r\nblack with age and polished by the beating of flails for many\r\ngenerations, till it had grown as slippery and as rich in hue as the\r\nstate-room floors of an Elizabethan mansion. Here the shearers knelt,\r\nthe sun slanting in upon their bleached shirts, tanned arms, and the\r\npolished shears they flourished, causing these to bristle with a\r\nthousand rays strong enough to blind a weak-eyed man. Beneath them a\r\ncaptive sheep lay panting, quickening its pants as misgiving merged in\r\nterror, till it quivered like the hot landscape outside.\r\n\r\nThis picture of to-day in its frame of four hundred years ago did not\r\nproduce that marked contrast between ancient and modern which is\r\nimplied by the contrast of date. In comparison with cities, Weatherbury\r\nwas immutable. The citizen\u2019s _Then_ is the rustic\u2019s _Now_. In London,\r\ntwenty or thirty-years ago are old times; in Paris ten years, or five;\r\nin Weatherbury three or four score years were included in the mere\r\npresent, and nothing less than a century set a mark on its face or\r\ntone. Five decades hardly modified the cut of a gaiter, the embroidery\r\nof a smock-frock, by the breadth of a hair. Ten generations failed to\r\nalter the turn of a single phrase. In these Wessex nooks the busy\r\noutsider\u2019s ancient times are only old; his old times are still new; his\r\npresent is futurity.\r\n\r\nSo the barn was natural to the shearers, and the shearers were in\r\nharmony with the barn.\r\n\r\nThe spacious ends of the building, answering ecclesiastically to nave\r\nand chancel extremities, were fenced off with hurdles, the sheep being\r\nall collected in a crowd within these two enclosures; and in one angle\r\na catching-pen was formed, in which three or four sheep were\r\ncontinuously kept ready for the shearers to seize without loss of time.\r\nIn the background, mellowed by tawny shade, were the three women,\r\nMaryann Money, and Temperance and Soberness Miller, gathering up the\r\nfleeces and twisting ropes of wool with a wimble for tying them round.\r\nThey were indifferently well assisted by the old maltster, who, when\r\nthe malting season from October to April had passed, made himself\r\nuseful upon any of the bordering farmsteads.\r\n\r\nBehind all was Bathsheba, carefully watching the men to see that there\r\nwas no cutting or wounding through carelessness, and that the animals\r\nwere shorn close. Gabriel, who flitted and hovered under her bright\r\neyes like a moth, did not shear continuously, half his time being spent\r\nin attending to the others and selecting the sheep for them. At the\r\npresent moment he was engaged in handing round a mug of mild liquor,\r\nsupplied from a barrel in the corner, and cut pieces of bread and\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, after throwing a glance here, a caution there, and lecturing\r\none of the younger operators who had allowed his last finished sheep to\r\ngo off among the flock without re-stamping it with her initials, came\r\nagain to Gabriel, as he put down the luncheon to drag a frightened ewe\r\nto his shear-station, flinging it over upon its back with a dexterous\r\ntwist of the arm. He lopped off the tresses about its head, and opened\r\nup the neck and collar, his mistress quietly looking on.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe blushes at the insult,\u201D murmured Bathsheba, watching the pink\r\nflush which arose and overspread the neck and shoulders of the ewe\r\nwhere they were left bare by the clicking shears\u2014a flush which was\r\nenviable, for its delicacy, by many queens of coteries, and would have\r\nbeen creditable, for its promptness, to any woman in the world.\r\n\r\nPoor Gabriel\u2019s soul was fed with a luxury of content by having her over\r\nhim, her eyes critically regarding his skilful shears, which apparently\r\nwere going to gather up a piece of the flesh at every close, and yet\r\nnever did so. Like Guildenstern, Oak was happy in that he was not over\r\nhappy. He had no wish to converse with her: that his bright lady and\r\nhimself formed one group, exclusively their own, and containing no\r\nothers in the world, was enough.\r\n\r\nSo the chatter was all on her side. There is a loquacity that tells\r\nnothing, which was Bathsheba\u2019s; and there is a silence which says much:\r\nthat was Gabriel\u2019s. Full of this dim and temperate bliss, he went on to\r\nfling the ewe over upon her other side, covering her head with his\r\nknee, gradually running the shears line after line round her dewlap;\r\nthence about her flank and back, and finishing over the tail.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell done, and done quickly!\u201D said Bathsheba, looking at her watch as\r\nthe last snip resounded.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow long, miss?\u201D said Gabriel, wiping his brow.\r\n\r\n\u201CThree-and-twenty minutes and a half since you took the first lock from\r\nits forehead. It is the first time that I have ever seen one done in\r\nless than half an hour.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe clean, sleek creature arose from its fleece\u2014how perfectly like\r\nAphrodite rising from the foam should have been seen to be\r\nrealized\u2014looking startled and shy at the loss of its garment, which lay\r\non the floor in one soft cloud, united throughout, the portion visible\r\nbeing the inner surface only, which, never before exposed, was white as\r\nsnow, and without flaw or blemish of the minutest kind.\r\n\r\n\u201CCain Ball!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, Mister Oak; here I be!\u201D\r\n\r\nCainy now runs forward with the tar-pot. \u201CB. E.\u201D is newly stamped upon\r\nthe shorn skin, and away the simple dam leaps, panting, over the board\r\ninto the shirtless flock outside. Then up comes Maryann; throws the\r\nloose locks into the middle of the fleece, rolls it up, and carries it\r\ninto the background as three-and-a-half pounds of unadulterated warmth\r\nfor the winter enjoyment of persons unknown and far away, who will,\r\nhowever, never experience the superlative comfort derivable from the\r\nwool as it here exists, new and pure\u2014before the unctuousness of its\r\nnature whilst in a living state has dried, stiffened, and been washed\r\nout\u2014rendering it just now as superior to anything _woollen_ as cream is\r\nsuperior to milk-and-water.\r\n\r\nBut heartless circumstance could not leave entire Gabriel\u2019s happiness\r\nof this morning. The rams, old ewes, and two-shear ewes had duly\r\nundergone their stripping, and the men were proceeding with the\r\nshearlings and hogs, when Oak\u2019s belief that she was going to stand\r\npleasantly by and time him through another performance was painfully\r\ninterrupted by Farmer Boldwood\u2019s appearance in the extremest corner of\r\nthe barn. Nobody seemed to have perceived his entry, but there he\r\ncertainly was. Boldwood always carried with him a social atmosphere of\r\nhis own, which everybody felt who came near him; and the talk, which\r\nBathsheba\u2019s presence had somewhat suppressed, was now totally\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nHe crossed over towards Bathsheba, who turned to greet him with a\r\ncarriage of perfect ease. He spoke to her in low tones, and she\r\ninstinctively modulated her own to the same pitch, and her voice\r\nultimately even caught the inflection of his. She was far from having a\r\nwish to appear mysteriously connected with him; but woman at the\r\nimpressionable age gravitates to the larger body not only in her choice\r\nof words, which is apparent every day, but even in her shades of tone\r\nand humour, when the influence is great.\r\n\r\nWhat they conversed about was not audible to Gabriel, who was too\r\nindependent to get near, though too concerned to disregard. The issue\r\nof their dialogue was the taking of her hand by the courteous farmer to\r\nhelp her over the spreading-board into the bright June sunlight\r\noutside. Standing beside the sheep already shorn, they went on talking\r\nagain. Concerning the flock? Apparently not. Gabriel theorized, not\r\nwithout truth, that in quiet discussion of any matter within reach of\r\nthe speakers\u2019 eyes, these are usually fixed upon it. Bathsheba demurely\r\nregarded a contemptible straw lying upon the ground, in a way which\r\nsuggested less ovine criticism than womanly embarrassment. She became\r\nmore or less red in the cheek, the blood wavering in uncertain flux and\r\nreflux over the sensitive space between ebb and flood. Gabriel sheared\r\non, constrained and sad.\r\n\r\nShe left Boldwood\u2019s side, and he walked up and down alone for nearly a\r\nquarter of an hour. Then she reappeared in her new riding-habit of\r\nmyrtle green, which fitted her to the waist as a rind fits its fruit;\r\nand young Bob Coggan led on her mare, Boldwood fetching his own horse\r\nfrom the tree under which it had been tied.\r\n\r\nOak\u2019s eyes could not forsake them; and in endeavouring to continue his\r\nshearing at the same time that he watched Boldwood\u2019s manner, he snipped\r\nthe sheep in the groin. The animal plunged; Bathsheba instantly gazed\r\ntowards it, and saw the blood.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Gabriel!\u201D she exclaimed, with severe remonstrance, \u201Cyou who are so\r\nstrict with the other men\u2014see what you are doing yourself!\u201D\r\n\r\nTo an outsider there was not much to complain of in this remark; but to\r\nOak, who knew Bathsheba to be well aware that she herself was the cause\r\nof the poor ewe\u2019s wound, because she had wounded the ewe\u2019s shearer in a\r\nstill more vital part, it had a sting which the abiding sense of his\r\ninferiority to both herself and Boldwood was not calculated to heal.\r\nBut a manly resolve to recognize boldly that he had no longer a lover\u2019s\r\ninterest in her, helped him occasionally to conceal a feeling.\r\n\r\n\u201CBottle!\u201D he shouted, in an unmoved voice of routine. Cainy Ball ran\r\nup, the wound was anointed, and the shearing continued.\r\n\r\nBoldwood gently tossed Bathsheba into the saddle, and before they\r\nturned away she again spoke out to Oak with the same dominative and\r\ntantalizing graciousness.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am going now to see Mr. Boldwood\u2019s Leicesters. Take my place in the\r\nbarn, Gabriel, and keep the men carefully to their work.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe horses\u2019 heads were put about, and they trotted away.\r\n\r\nBoldwood\u2019s deep attachment was a matter of great interest among all\r\naround him; but, after having been pointed out for so many years as the\r\nperfect exemplar of thriving bachelorship, his lapse was an anticlimax\r\nsomewhat resembling that of St. John Long\u2019s death by consumption in the\r\nmidst of his proofs that it was not a fatal disease.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat means matrimony,\u201D said Temperance Miller, following them out of\r\nsight with her eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201CI reckon that\u2019s the size o\u2019t,\u201D said Coggan, working along without\r\nlooking up.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, better wed over the mixen than over the moor,\u201D said Laban Tall,\r\nturning his sheep.\r\n\r\nHenery Fray spoke, exhibiting miserable eyes at the same time: \u201CI don\u2019t\r\nsee why a maid should take a husband when she\u2019s bold enough to fight\r\nher own battles, and don\u2019t want a home; for \u2019tis keeping another woman\r\nout. But let it be, for \u2019tis a pity he and she should trouble two\r\nhouses.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs usual with decided characters, Bathsheba invariably provoked the\r\ncriticism of individuals like Henery Fray. Her emblazoned fault was to\r\nbe too pronounced in her objections, and not sufficiently overt in her\r\nlikings. We learn that it is not the rays which bodies absorb, but\r\nthose which they reject, that give them the colours they are known by;\r\nand in the same way people are specialized by their dislikes and\r\nantagonisms, whilst their goodwill is looked upon as no attribute at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nHenery continued in a more complaisant mood: \u201CI once hinted my mind to\r\nher on a few things, as nearly as a battered frame dared to do so to\r\nsuch a froward piece. You all know, neighbours, what a man I be, and\r\nhow I come down with my powerful words when my pride is boiling wi\u2019\r\nscarn?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe do, we do, Henery.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSo I said, \u2018Mistress Everdene, there\u2019s places empty, and there\u2019s\r\ngifted men willing; but the spite\u2019\u2014no, not the spite\u2014I didn\u2019t say\r\nspite\u2014\u2018but the villainy of the contrarikind,\u2019 I said (meaning\r\nwomankind), \u2018keeps \u2019em out.\u2019 That wasn\u2019t too strong for her, say?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPassably well put.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; and I would have said it, had death and salvation overtook me for\r\nit. Such is my spirit when I have a mind.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA true man, and proud as a lucifer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou see the artfulness? Why, \u2019twas about being baily really; but I\r\ndidn\u2019t put it so plain that she could understand my meaning, so I could\r\nlay it on all the stronger. That was my depth!... However, let her\r\nmarry an she will. Perhaps \u2019tis high time. I believe Farmer Boldwood\r\nkissed her behind the spear-bed at the sheep-washing t\u2019other day\u2014that I\r\ndo.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a lie!\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, neighbour Oak\u2014how\u2019st know?\u201D said, Henery, mildly.\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause she told me all that passed,\u201D said Oak, with a pharisaical\r\nsense that he was not as other shearers in this matter.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe have a right to believe it,\u201D said Henery, with dudgeon; \u201Ca very\r\ntrue right. But I mid see a little distance into things! To be\r\nlong-headed enough for a baily\u2019s place is a poor mere trifle\u2014yet a\r\ntrifle more than nothing. However, I look round upon life quite cool.\r\nDo you heed me, neighbours? My words, though made as simple as I can,\r\nmid be rather deep for some heads.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CO yes, Henery, we quite heed ye.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA strange old piece, goodmen\u2014whirled about from here to yonder, as if\r\nI were nothing! A little warped, too. But I have my depths; ha, and\r\neven my great depths! I might gird at a certain shepherd, brain to\r\nbrain. But no\u2014O no!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA strange old piece, ye say!\u201D interposed the maltster, in a querulous\r\nvoice. \u201CAt the same time ye be no old man worth naming\u2014no old man at\r\nall. Yer teeth bain\u2019t half gone yet; and what\u2019s a old man\u2019s standing if\r\nso be his teeth bain\u2019t gone? Weren\u2019t I stale in wedlock afore ye were\r\nout of arms? \u2019Tis a poor thing to be sixty, when there\u2019s people far\r\npast four-score\u2014a boast weak as water.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was the unvarying custom in Weatherbury to sink minor differences\r\nwhen the maltster had to be pacified.\r\n\r\n\u201CWeak as water! yes,\u201D said Jan Coggan. \u201CMalter, we feel ye to be a\r\nwonderful veteran man, and nobody can gainsay it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNobody,\u201D said Joseph Poorgrass. \u201CYe be a very rare old spectacle,\r\nmalter, and we all admire ye for that gift.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy, and as a young man, when my senses were in prosperity, I was\r\nlikewise liked by a good-few who knowed me,\u201D said the maltster.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Ithout doubt you was\u2014\u2019ithout doubt.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe bent and hoary man was satisfied, and so apparently was Henery\r\nFray. That matters should continue pleasant Maryann spoke, who, what\r\nwith her brown complexion, and the working wrapper of rusty linsey, had\r\nat present the mellow hue of an old sketch in oils\u2014notably some of\r\nNicholas Poussin\u2019s:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CDo anybody know of a crooked man, or a lame, or any second-hand fellow\r\nat all that would do for poor me?\u201D said Maryann. \u201CA perfect one I don\u2019t\r\nexpect to get at my time of life. If I could hear of such a thing\r\n\u2019twould do me more good than toast and ale.\u201D\r\n\r\nCoggan furnished a suitable reply. Oak went on with his shearing, and\r\nsaid not another word. Pestilent moods had come, and teased away his\r\nquiet. Bathsheba had shown indications of anointing him above his\r\nfellows by installing him as the bailiff that the farm imperatively\r\nrequired. He did not covet the post relatively to the farm: in relation\r\nto herself, as beloved by him and unmarried to another, he had coveted\r\nit. His readings of her seemed now to be vapoury and indistinct. His\r\nlecture to her was, he thought, one of the absurdest mistakes. Far from\r\ncoquetting with Boldwood, she had trifled with himself in thus feigning\r\nthat she had trifled with another. He was inwardly convinced that, in\r\naccordance with the anticipations of his easy-going and worse-educated\r\ncomrades, that day would see Boldwood the accepted husband of Miss\r\nEverdene. Gabriel at this time of his life had out-grown the\r\ninstinctive dislike which every Christian boy has for reading the\r\nBible, perusing it now quite frequently, and he inwardly said, \u201C\u2018I find\r\nmore bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets!\u2019\u201D This\r\nwas mere exclamation\u2014the froth of the storm. He adored Bathsheba just\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe workfolk shall have some lordly junketing to-night,\u201D said Cainy\r\nBall, casting forth his thoughts in a new direction. \u201CThis morning I\r\nsee \u2019em making the great puddens in the milking-pails\u2014lumps of fat as\r\nbig as yer thumb, Mister Oak! I\u2019ve never seed such splendid large knobs\r\nof fat before in the days of my life\u2014they never used to be bigger then\r\na horse-bean. And there was a great black crock upon the brandish with\r\nhis legs a-sticking out, but I don\u2019t know what was in within.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd there\u2019s two bushels of biffins for apple-pies,\u201D said Maryann.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I hope to do my duty by it all,\u201D said Joseph Poorgrass, in a\r\npleasant, masticating manner of anticipation. \u201CYes; victuals and drink\r\nis a cheerful thing, and gives nerves to the nerveless, if the form of\r\nwords may be used. \u2019Tis the gospel of the body, without which we\r\nperish, so to speak it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\nEVENTIDE\u2014A SECOND DECLARATION\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the shearing-supper a long table was placed on the grass-plot\r\nbeside the house, the end of the table being thrust over the sill of\r\nthe wide parlour window and a foot or two into the room. Miss Everdene\r\nsat inside the window, facing down the table. She was thus at the head\r\nwithout mingling with the men.\r\n\r\nThis evening Bathsheba was unusually excited, her red cheeks and lips\r\ncontrasting lustrously with the mazy skeins of her shadowy hair. She\r\nseemed to expect assistance, and the seat at the bottom of the table\r\nwas at her request left vacant until after they had begun the meal. She\r\nthen asked Gabriel to take the place and the duties appertaining to\r\nthat end, which he did with great readiness.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mr. Boldwood came in at the gate, and crossed the green\r\nto Bathsheba at the window. He apologized for his lateness: his arrival\r\nwas evidently by arrangement.\r\n\r\n\u201CGabriel,\u201D said she, \u201Cwill you move again, please, and let Mr. Boldwood\r\ncome there?\u201D\r\n\r\nOak moved in silence back to his original seat.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman-farmer was dressed in cheerful style, in a new coat and\r\nwhite waistcoat, quite contrasting with his usual sober suits of grey.\r\nInwardy, too, he was blithe, and consequently chatty to an exceptional\r\ndegree. So also was Bathsheba now that he had come, though the\r\nuninvited presence of Pennyways, the bailiff who had been dismissed for\r\ntheft, disturbed her equanimity for a while.\r\n\r\nSupper being ended, Coggan began on his own private account, without\r\nreference to listeners:\u2014\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve lost my love, and I care not,\r\nI\u2019ve lost my love, and I care not;\r\n    I shall soon have another\r\n    That\u2019s better than t\u2019other;\r\nI\u2019ve lost my love, and I care not.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lyric, when concluded, was received with a silently appreciative\r\ngaze at the table, implying that the performance, like a work by those\r\nestablished authors who are independent of notices in the papers, was a\r\nwell-known delight which required no applause.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, Master Poorgrass, your song!\u201D said Coggan.\r\n\r\n\u201CI be all but in liquor, and the gift is wanting in me,\u201D said Joseph,\r\ndiminishing himself.\r\n\r\n\u201CNonsense; wou\u2019st never be so ungrateful, Joseph\u2014never!\u201D said Coggan,\r\nexpressing hurt feelings by an inflection of voice. \u201CAnd mistress is\r\nlooking hard at ye, as much as to say, \u2018Sing at once, Joseph\r\nPoorgrass.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFaith, so she is; well, I must suffer it!... Just eye my features, and\r\nsee if the tell-tale blood overheats me much, neighbours?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, yer blushes be quite reasonable,\u201D said Coggan.\r\n\r\n\u201CI always tries to keep my colours from rising when a beauty\u2019s eyes get\r\nfixed on me,\u201D said Joseph, differently; \u201Cbut if so be \u2019tis willed they\r\ndo, they must.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, Joseph, your song, please,\u201D said Bathsheba, from the window.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, really, ma\u2019am,\u201D he replied, in a yielding tone, \u201CI don\u2019t know\r\nwhat to say. It would be a poor plain ballet of my own composure.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHear, hear!\u201D said the supper-party.\r\n\r\nPoorgrass, thus assured, trilled forth a flickering yet commendable\r\npiece of sentiment, the tune of which consisted of the key-note and\r\nanother, the latter being the sound chiefly dwelt upon. This was so\r\nsuccessful that he rashly plunged into a second in the same breath,\r\nafter a few false starts:\u2014\r\n\r\nI sow\u2032-ed th\u2032-e.....\r\nI sow\u2032-ed.....\r\nI sow\u2032-ed th\u2032-e seeds\u2032 of\u2032 love\u2032,\r\n    I-it was\u2032 all\u2032 i\u2032-in the\u2032-e spring\u2032,\r\nI-in A\u2032-pril\u2032, Ma\u2032-ay, a\u2032-nd sun\u2032-ny\u2032 June\u2032,\r\n    When sma\u2032-all bi\u2032-irds they\u2032 do\u2032 sing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CWell put out of hand,\u201D said Coggan, at the end of the verse. \u201C\u2018They do\r\nsing\u2019 was a very taking paragraph.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAy; and there was a pretty place at \u2018seeds of love.\u2019 and \u2019twas well\r\nheaved out. Though \u2018love\u2019 is a nasty high corner when a man\u2019s voice is\r\ngetting crazed. Next verse, Master Poorgrass.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut during this rendering young Bob Coggan exhibited one of those\r\nanomalies which will afflict little people when other persons are\r\nparticularly serious: in trying to check his laughter, he pushed down\r\nhis throat as much of the tablecloth as he could get hold of, when,\r\nafter continuing hermetically sealed for a short time, his mirth burst\r\nout through his nose. Joseph perceived it, and with hectic cheeks of\r\nindignation instantly ceased singing. Coggan boxed Bob\u2019s ears\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\u201CGo on, Joseph\u2014go on, and never mind the young scamp,\u201D said Coggan.\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis a very catching ballet. Now then again\u2014the next bar; I\u2019ll help ye\r\nto flourish up the shrill notes where yer wind is rather wheezy:\u2014\r\n\r\nOh the wi\u2032-il-lo\u2032-ow tree\u2032 will\u2032 twist\u2032,\r\nAnd the wil\u2032-low\u2032 tre\u2032-ee wi\u2032-ill twine\u2032.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the singer could not be set going again. Bob Coggan was sent home\r\nfor his ill manners, and tranquility was restored by Jacob Smallbury,\r\nwho volunteered a ballad as inclusive and interminable as that with\r\nwhich the worthy toper old Silenus amused on a similar occasion the\r\nswains Chromis and Mnasylus, and other jolly dogs of his day.\r\n\r\nIt was still the beaming time of evening, though night was stealthily\r\nmaking itself visible low down upon the ground, the western lines of\r\nlight raking the earth without alighting upon it to any extent, or\r\nilluminating the dead levels at all. The sun had crept round the tree\r\nas a last effort before death, and then began to sink, the shearers\u2019\r\nlower parts becoming steeped in embrowning twilight, whilst their heads\r\nand shoulders were still enjoying day, touched with a yellow of\r\nself-sustained brilliancy that seemed inherent rather than acquired.\r\n\r\nThe sun went down in an ochreous mist; but they sat, and talked on, and\r\ngrew as merry as the gods in Homer\u2019s heaven. Bathsheba still remained\r\nenthroned inside the window, and occupied herself in knitting, from\r\nwhich she sometimes looked up to view the fading scene outside. The\r\nslow twilight expanded and enveloped them completely before the signs\r\nof moving were shown.\r\n\r\nGabriel suddenly missed Farmer Boldwood from his place at the bottom of\r\nthe table. How long he had been gone Oak did not know; but he had\r\napparently withdrawn into the encircling dusk. Whilst he was thinking\r\nof this, Liddy brought candles into the back part of the room\r\noverlooking the shearers, and their lively new flames shone down the\r\ntable and over the men, and dispersed among the green shadows behind.\r\nBathsheba\u2019s form, still in its original position, was now again\r\ndistinct between their eyes and the light, which revealed that Boldwood\r\nhad gone inside the room, and was sitting near her.\r\n\r\nNext came the question of the evening. Would Miss Everdene sing to them\r\nthe song she always sang so charmingly\u2014\u201CThe Banks of Allan\r\nWater\u201D\u2014before they went home?\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\u2019s consideration Bathsheba assented, beckoning to\r\nGabriel, who hastened up into the coveted atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you brought your flute?\u201D she whispered.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, miss.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPlay to my singing, then.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe stood up in the window-opening, facing the men, the candles behind\r\nher, Gabriel on her right hand, immediately outside the sash-frame.\r\nBoldwood had drawn up on her left, within the room. Her singing was\r\nsoft and rather tremulous at first, but it soon swelled to a steady\r\nclearness. Subsequent events caused one of the verses to be remembered\r\nfor many months, and even years, by more than one of those who were\r\ngathered there:\u2014\r\n\r\nFor his bride a soldier sought her,\r\n    And a winning tongue had he:\r\nOn the banks of Allan Water\r\n    None was gay as she!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the dulcet piping of Gabriel\u2019s flute, Boldwood supplied\r\na bass in his customary profound voice, uttering his notes so softly,\r\nhowever, as to abstain entirely from making anything like an ordinary\r\nduet of the song; they rather formed a rich unexplored shadow, which\r\nthrew her tones into relief. The shearers reclined against each other\r\nas at suppers in the early ages of the world, and so silent and\r\nabsorbed were they that her breathing could almost be heard between the\r\nbars; and at the end of the ballad, when the last tone loitered on to\r\nan inexpressible close, there arose that buzz of pleasure which is the\r\nattar of applause.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that Gabriel could not avoid noting\r\nthe farmer\u2019s bearing to-night towards their entertainer. Yet there was\r\nnothing exceptional in his actions beyond what appertained to his time\r\nof performing them. It was when the rest were all looking away that\r\nBoldwood observed her; when they regarded her he turned aside; when\r\nthey thanked or praised he was silent; when they were inattentive he\r\nmurmured his thanks. The meaning lay in the difference between actions,\r\nnone of which had any meaning of itself; and the necessity of being\r\njealous, which lovers are troubled with, did not lead Oak to\r\nunderestimate these signs.\r\n\r\nBathsheba then wished them good-night, withdrew from the window, and\r\nretired to the back part of the room, Boldwood thereupon closing the\r\nsash and the shutters, and remaining inside with her. Oak wandered away\r\nunder the quiet and scented trees. Recovering from the softer\r\nimpressions produced by Bathsheba\u2019s voice, the shearers rose to leave,\r\nCoggan turning to Pennyways as he pushed back the bench to pass out:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CI like to give praise where praise is due, and the man deserves\r\nit\u2014that \u2019a do so,\u201D he remarked, looking at the worthy thief, as if he\r\nwere the masterpiece of some world-renowned artist.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure I should never have believed it if we hadn\u2019t proved it, so to\r\nallude,\u201D hiccupped Joseph Poorgrass, \u201Cthat every cup, every one of the\r\nbest knives and forks, and every empty bottle be in their place as\r\nperfect now as at the beginning, and not one stole at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t deserve half the praise you give me,\u201D said the\r\nvirtuous thief, grimly.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I\u2019ll say this for Pennyways,\u201D added Coggan, \u201Cthat whenever he do\r\nreally make up his mind to do a noble thing in the shape of a good\r\naction, as I could see by his face he did to-night afore sitting down,\r\nhe\u2019s generally able to carry it out. Yes, I\u2019m proud to say, neighbours,\r\nthat he\u2019s stole nothing at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, \u2019tis an honest deed, and we thank ye for it, Pennyways,\u201D said\r\nJoseph; to which opinion the remainder of the company subscribed\r\nunanimously.\r\n\r\nAt this time of departure, when nothing more was visible of the inside\r\nof the parlour than a thin and still chink of light between the\r\nshutters, a passionate scene was in course of enactment there.\r\n\r\nMiss Everdene and Boldwood were alone. Her cheeks had lost a great deal\r\nof their healthful fire from the very seriousness of her position; but\r\nher eye was bright with the excitement of a triumph\u2014though it was a\r\ntriumph which had rather been contemplated than desired.\r\n\r\nShe was standing behind a low arm-chair, from which she had just risen,\r\nand he was kneeling in it\u2014inclining himself over its back towards her,\r\nand holding her hand in both his own. His body moved restlessly, and it\r\nwas with what Keats daintily calls a too happy happiness. This unwonted\r\nabstraction by love of all dignity from a man of whom it had ever\r\nseemed the chief component, was, in its distressing incongruity, a pain\r\nto her which quenched much of the pleasure she derived from the proof\r\nthat she was idolized.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will try to love you,\u201D she was saying, in a trembling voice quite\r\nunlike her usual self-confidence. \u201CAnd if I can believe in any way that\r\nI shall make you a good wife I shall indeed be willing to marry you.\r\nBut, Mr. Boldwood, hesitation on so high a matter is honourable in any\r\nwoman, and I don\u2019t want to give a solemn promise to-night. I would\r\nrather ask you to wait a few weeks till I can see my situation better.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you have every reason to believe that _then_\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have every reason to hope that at the end of the five or six weeks,\r\nbetween this time and harvest, that you say you are going to be away\r\nfrom home, I shall be able to promise to be your wife,\u201D she said,\r\nfirmly. \u201CBut remember this distinctly, I don\u2019t promise yet.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is enough; I don\u2019t ask more. I can wait on those dear words. And\r\nnow, Miss Everdene, good-night!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood-night,\u201D she said, graciously\u2014almost tenderly; and Boldwood\r\nwithdrew with a serene smile.\r\n\r\nBathsheba knew more of him now; he had entirely bared his heart before\r\nher, even until he had almost worn in her eyes the sorry look of a\r\ngrand bird without the feathers that make it grand. She had been\r\nawe-struck at her past temerity, and was struggling to make amends\r\nwithout thinking whether the sin quite deserved the penalty she was\r\nschooling herself to pay. To have brought all this about her ears was\r\nterrible; but after a while the situation was not without a fearful\r\njoy. The facility with which even the most timid women sometimes\r\nacquire a relish for the dreadful when that is amalgamated with a\r\nlittle triumph, is marvellous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\nTHE SAME NIGHT\u2014THE FIR PLANTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the multifarious duties which Bathsheba had voluntarily imposed\r\nupon herself by dispensing with the services of a bailiff, was the\r\nparticular one of looking round the homestead before going to bed, to\r\nsee that all was right and safe for the night. Gabriel had almost\r\nconstantly preceded her in this tour every evening, watching her\r\naffairs as carefully as any specially appointed officer of surveillance\r\ncould have done; but this tender devotion was to a great extent unknown\r\nto his mistress, and as much as was known was somewhat thanklessly\r\nreceived. Women are never tired of bewailing man\u2019s fickleness in love,\r\nbut they only seem to snub his constancy.\r\n\r\nAs watching is best done invisibly, she usually carried a dark lantern\r\nin her hand, and every now and then turned on the light to examine\r\nnooks and corners with the coolness of a metropolitan policeman. This\r\ncoolness may have owed its existence not so much to her fearlessness of\r\nexpected danger as to her freedom from the suspicion of any; her worst\r\nanticipated discovery being that a horse might not be well bedded, the\r\nfowls not all in, or a door not closed.\r\n\r\nThis night the buildings were inspected as usual, and she went round to\r\nthe farm paddock. Here the only sounds disturbing the stillness were\r\nsteady munchings of many mouths, and stentorian breathings from all but\r\ninvisible noses, ending in snores and puffs like the blowing of bellows\r\nslowly. Then the munching would recommence, when the lively imagination\r\nmight assist the eye to discern a group of pink-white nostrils, shaped\r\nas caverns, and very clammy and humid on their surfaces, not exactly\r\npleasant to the touch until one got used to them; the mouths beneath\r\nhaving a great partiality for closing upon any loose end of Bathsheba\u2019s\r\napparel which came within reach of their tongues. Above each of these a\r\nstill keener vision suggested a brown forehead and two staring though\r\nnot unfriendly eyes, and above all a pair of whitish crescent-shaped\r\nhorns like two particularly new moons, an occasional stolid \u201Cmoo!\u201D\r\nproclaiming beyond the shade of a doubt that these phenomena were the\r\nfeatures and persons of Daisy, Whitefoot, Bonny-lass, Jolly-O, Spot,\r\nTwinkle-eye, etc., etc.\u2014the respectable dairy of Devon cows belonging\r\nto Bathsheba aforesaid.\r\n\r\nHer way back to the house was by a path through a young plantation of\r\ntapering firs, which had been planted some years earlier to shelter the\r\npremises from the north wind. By reason of the density of the\r\ninterwoven foliage overhead, it was gloomy there at cloudless noontide,\r\ntwilight in the evening, dark as midnight at dusk, and black as the\r\nninth plague of Egypt at midnight. To describe the spot is to call it a\r\nvast, low, naturally formed hall, the plumy ceiling of which was\r\nsupported by slender pillars of living wood, the floor being covered\r\nwith a soft dun carpet of dead spikelets and mildewed cones, with a\r\ntuft of grass-blades here and there.\r\n\r\nThis bit of the path was always the crux of the night\u2019s ramble, though,\r\nbefore starting, her apprehensions of danger were not vivid enough to\r\nlead her to take a companion. Slipping along here covertly as Time,\r\nBathsheba fancied she could hear footsteps entering the track at the\r\nopposite end. It was certainly a rustle of footsteps. Her own instantly\r\nfell as gently as snowflakes. She reassured herself by a remembrance\r\nthat the path was public, and that the traveller was probably some\r\nvillager returning home; regretting, at the same time, that the meeting\r\nshould be about to occur in the darkest point of her route, even though\r\nonly just outside her own door.\r\n\r\nThe noise approached, came close, and a figure was apparently on the\r\npoint of gliding past her when something tugged at her skirt and pinned\r\nit forcibly to the ground. The instantaneous check nearly threw\r\nBathsheba off her balance. In recovering she struck against warm\r\nclothes and buttons.\r\n\r\n\u201CA rum start, upon my soul!\u201D said a masculine voice, a foot or so above\r\nher head. \u201CHave I hurt you, mate?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Bathsheba, attempting to shrink away.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe have got hitched together somehow, I think.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you a woman?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA lady, I should have said.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am a man.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh!\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba softly tugged again, but to no purpose.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that a dark lantern you have? I fancy so,\u201D said the man.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you\u2019ll allow me I\u2019ll open it, and set you free.\u201D\r\n\r\nA hand seized the lantern, the door was opened, the rays burst out from\r\ntheir prison, and Bathsheba beheld her position with astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe man to whom she was hooked was brilliant in brass and scarlet. He\r\nwas a soldier. His sudden appearance was to darkness what the sound of\r\na trumpet is to silence. Gloom, the _genius loci_ at all times\r\nhitherto, was now totally overthrown, less by the lantern-light than by\r\nwhat the lantern lighted. The contrast of this revelation with her\r\nanticipations of some sinister figure in sombre garb was so great that\r\nit had upon her the effect of a fairy transformation.\r\n\r\nIt was immediately apparent that the military man\u2019s spur had become\r\nentangled in the gimp which decorated the skirt of her dress. He caught\r\na view of her face.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll unfasten you in one moment, miss,\u201D he said, with new-born\r\ngallantry.\r\n\r\n\u201COh no\u2014I can do it, thank you,\u201D she hastily replied, and stooped for\r\nthe performance.\r\n\r\nThe unfastening was not such a trifling affair. The rowel of the spur\r\nhad so wound itself among the gimp cords in those few moments, that\r\nseparation was likely to be a matter of time.\r\n\r\nHe too stooped, and the lantern standing on the ground betwixt them\r\nthrew the gleam from its open side among the fir-tree needles and the\r\nblades of long damp grass with the effect of a large glowworm. It\r\nradiated upwards into their faces, and sent over half the plantation\r\ngigantic shadows of both man and woman, each dusky shape becoming\r\ndistorted and mangled upon the tree-trunks till it wasted to nothing.\r\n\r\nHe looked hard into her eyes when she raised them for a moment;\r\nBathsheba looked down again, for his gaze was too strong to be received\r\npoint-blank with her own. But she had obliquely noticed that he was\r\nyoung and slim, and that he wore three chevrons upon his sleeve.\r\n\r\nBathsheba pulled again.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are a prisoner, miss; it is no use blinking the matter,\u201D said the\r\nsoldier, drily. \u201CI must cut your dress if you are in such a hurry.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes\u2014please do!\u201D she exclaimed, helplessly.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt wouldn\u2019t be necessary if you could wait a moment,\u201D and he unwound a\r\ncord from the little wheel. She withdrew her own hand, but, whether by\r\naccident or design, he touched it. Bathsheba was vexed; she hardly knew\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\nHis unravelling went on, but it nevertheless seemed coming to no end.\r\nShe looked at him again.\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you for the sight of such a beautiful face!\u201D said the young\r\nsergeant, without ceremony.\r\n\r\nShe coloured with embarrassment. \u201C\u2019Twas unwillingly shown,\u201D she\r\nreplied, stiffly, and with as much dignity\u2014which was very little\u2014as she\r\ncould infuse into a position of captivity.\r\n\r\n\u201CI like you the better for that incivility, miss,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CI should have liked\u2014I wish\u2014you had never shown yourself to me by\r\nintruding here!\u201D She pulled again, and the gathers of her dress began\r\nto give way like liliputian musketry.\r\n\r\n\u201CI deserve the chastisement your words give me. But why should such a\r\nfair and dutiful girl have such an aversion to her father\u2019s sex?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGo on your way, please.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat, Beauty, and drag you after me? Do but look; I never saw such a\r\ntangle!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, \u2019tis shameful of you; you have been making it worse on purpose to\r\nkeep me here\u2014you have!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed, I don\u2019t think so,\u201D said the sergeant, with a merry twinkle.\r\n\r\n\u201CI tell you you have!\u201D she exclaimed, in high temper. \u201CI insist upon\r\nundoing it. Now, allow me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly, miss; I am not of steel.\u201D He added a sigh which had as much\r\narchness in it as a sigh could possess without losing its nature\r\naltogether. \u201CI am thankful for beauty, even when \u2019tis thrown to me like\r\na bone to a dog. These moments will be over too soon!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe closed her lips in a determined silence.\r\n\r\nBathsheba was revolving in her mind whether by a bold and desperate\r\nrush she could free herself at the risk of leaving her skirt bodily\r\nbehind her. The thought was too dreadful. The dress\u2014which she had put\r\non to appear stately at the supper\u2014was the head and front of her\r\nwardrobe; not another in her stock became her so well. What woman in\r\nBathsheba\u2019s position, not naturally timid, and within call of her\r\nretainers, would have bought escape from a dashing soldier at so dear a\r\nprice?\r\n\r\n\u201CAll in good time; it will soon be done, I perceive,\u201D said her cool\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis trifling provokes, and\u2014and\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot too cruel!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014Insults me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is done in order that I may have the pleasure of apologizing to so\r\ncharming a woman, which I straightway do most humbly, madam,\u201D he said,\r\nbowing low.\r\n\r\nBathsheba really knew not what to say.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve seen a good many women in my time,\u201D continued the young man in a\r\nmurmur, and more thoughtfully than hitherto, critically regarding her\r\nbent head at the same time; \u201Cbut I\u2019ve never seen a woman so beautiful\r\nas you. Take it or leave it\u2014be offended or like it\u2014I don\u2019t care.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho are you, then, who can so well afford to despise opinion?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo stranger. Sergeant Troy. I am staying in this place.\u2014There! it is\r\nundone at last, you see. Your light fingers were more eager than mine.\r\nI wish it had been the knot of knots, which there\u2019s no untying!\u201D\r\n\r\nThis was worse and worse. She started up, and so did he. How to\r\ndecently get away from him\u2014that was her difficulty now. She sidled off\r\ninch by inch, the lantern in her hand, till she could see the redness\r\nof his coat no longer.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, Beauty; good-bye!\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nShe made no reply, and, reaching a distance of twenty or thirty yards,\r\nturned about, and ran indoors.\r\n\r\nLiddy had just retired to rest. In ascending to her own chamber,\r\nBathsheba opened the girl\u2019s door an inch or two, and, panting, said\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CLiddy, is any soldier staying in the village\u2014sergeant somebody\u2014rather\r\ngentlemanly for a sergeant, and good looking\u2014a red coat with blue\r\nfacings?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, miss.... No, I say; but really it might be Sergeant Troy home on\r\nfurlough, though I have not seen him. He was here once in that way when\r\nthe regiment was at Casterbridge.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; that\u2019s the name. Had he a moustache\u2014no whiskers or beard?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe had.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat kind of a person is he?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh! miss\u2014I blush to name it\u2014a gay man! But I know him to be very quick\r\nand trim, who might have made his thousands, like a squire. Such a\r\nclever young dandy as he is! He\u2019s a doctor\u2019s son by name, which is a\r\ngreat deal; and he\u2019s an earl\u2019s son by nature!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhich is a great deal more. Fancy! Is it true?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. And, he was brought up so well, and sent to Casterbridge Grammar\r\nSchool for years and years. Learnt all languages while he was there;\r\nand it was said he got on so far that he could take down Chinese in\r\nshorthand; but that I don\u2019t answer for, as it was only reported.\r\nHowever, he wasted his gifted lot, and listed a soldier; but even then\r\nhe rose to be a sergeant without trying at all. Ah! such a blessing it\r\nis to be high-born; nobility of blood will shine out even in the ranks\r\nand files. And is he really come home, miss?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI believe so. Good-night, Liddy.\u201D\r\n\r\nAfter all, how could a cheerful wearer of skirts be permanently\r\noffended with the man? There are occasions when girls like Bathsheba\r\nwill put up with a great deal of unconventional behaviour. When they\r\nwant to be praised, which is often, when they want to be mastered,\r\nwhich is sometimes; and when they want no nonsense, which is seldom.\r\nJust now the first feeling was in the ascendant with Bathsheba, with a\r\ndash of the second. Moreover, by chance or by devilry, the ministrant\r\nwas antecedently made interesting by being a handsome stranger who had\r\nevidently seen better days.\r\n\r\nSo she could not clearly decide whether it was her opinion that he had\r\ninsulted her or not.\r\n\r\n\u201CWas ever anything so odd!\u201D she at last exclaimed to herself, in her\r\nown room. \u201CAnd was ever anything so meanly done as what I did\u2014to skulk\r\naway like that from a man who was only civil and kind!\u201D Clearly she did\r\nnot think his barefaced praise of her person an insult now.\r\n\r\nIt was a fatal omission of Boldwood\u2019s that he had never once told her\r\nshe was beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\nTHE NEW ACQUAINTANCE DESCRIBED\r\n\r\n\r\nIdiosyncrasy and vicissitude had combined to stamp Sergeant Troy as an\r\nexceptional being.\r\n\r\nHe was a man to whom memories were an incumbrance, and anticipations a\r\nsuperfluity. Simply feeling, considering, and caring for what was\r\nbefore his eyes, he was vulnerable only in the present. His outlook\r\nupon time was as a transient flash of the eye now and then: that\r\nprojection of consciousness into days gone by and to come, which makes\r\nthe past a synonym for the pathetic and the future a word for\r\ncircumspection, was foreign to Troy. With him the past was yesterday;\r\nthe future, to-morrow; never, the day after.\r\n\r\nOn this account he might, in certain lights, have been regarded as one\r\nof the most fortunate of his order. For it may be argued with great\r\nplausibility that reminiscence is less an endowment than a disease, and\r\nthat expectation in its only comfortable form\u2014that of absolute faith\u2014is\r\npractically an impossibility; whilst in the form of hope and the\r\nsecondary compounds, patience, impatience, resolve, curiosity, it is a\r\nconstant fluctuation between pleasure and pain.\r\n\r\nSergeant Troy, being entirely innocent of the practice of expectation,\r\nwas never disappointed. To set against this negative gain there may\r\nhave been some positive losses from a certain narrowing of the higher\r\ntastes and sensations which it entailed. But limitation of the capacity\r\nis never recognized as a loss by the loser therefrom: in this attribute\r\nmoral or \u00E6sthetic poverty contrasts plausibly with material, since\r\nthose who suffer do not mind it, whilst those who mind it soon cease to\r\nsuffer. It is not a denial of anything to have been always without it,\r\nand what Troy had never enjoyed he did not miss; but, being fully\r\nconscious that what sober people missed he enjoyed, his capacity,\r\nthough really less, seemed greater than theirs.\r\n\r\nHe was moderately truthful towards men, but to women lied like a\r\nCretan\u2014a system of ethics above all others calculated to win popularity\r\nat the first flush of admission into lively society; and the\r\npossibility of the favour gained being transitory had reference only to\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nHe never passed the line which divides the spruce vices from the ugly;\r\nand hence, though his morals had hardly been applauded, disapproval of\r\nthem had frequently been tempered with a smile. This treatment had led\r\nto his becoming a sort of regrater of other men\u2019s gallantries, to his\r\nown aggrandizement as a Corinthian, rather than to the moral profit of\r\nhis hearers.\r\n\r\nHis reason and his propensities had seldom any reciprocating influence,\r\nhaving separated by mutual consent long ago: thence it sometimes\r\nhappened that, while his intentions were as honourable as could be\r\nwished, any particular deed formed a dark background which threw them\r\ninto fine relief. The sergeant\u2019s vicious phases being the offspring of\r\nimpulse, and his virtuous phases of cool meditation, the latter had a\r\nmodest tendency to be oftener heard of than seen.\r\n\r\nTroy was full of activity, but his activities were less of a locomotive\r\nthan a vegetative nature; and, never being based upon any original\r\nchoice of foundation or direction, they were exercised on whatever\r\nobject chance might place in their way. Hence, whilst he sometimes\r\nreached the brilliant in speech because that was spontaneous, he fell\r\nbelow the commonplace in action, from inability to guide incipient\r\neffort. He had a quick comprehension and considerable force of\r\ncharacter; but, being without the power to combine them, the\r\ncomprehension became engaged with trivialities whilst waiting for the\r\nwill to direct it, and the force wasted itself in useless grooves\r\nthrough unheeding the comprehension.\r\n\r\nHe was a fairly well-educated man for one of middle class\u2014exceptionally\r\nwell educated for a common soldier. He spoke fluently and unceasingly.\r\nHe could in this way be one thing and seem another: for instance, he\r\ncould speak of love and think of dinner; call on the husband to look at\r\nthe wife; be eager to pay and intend to owe.\r\n\r\nThe wondrous power of flattery in _passados_ at woman is a perception\r\nso universal as to be remarked upon by many people almost as\r\nautomatically as they repeat a proverb, or say that they are Christians\r\nand the like, without thinking much of the enormous corollaries which\r\nspring from the proposition. Still less is it acted upon for the good\r\nof the complemental being alluded to. With the majority such an opinion\r\nis shelved with all those trite aphorisms which require some\r\ncatastrophe to bring their tremendous meanings thoroughly home. When\r\nexpressed with some amount of reflectiveness it seems co-ordinate with\r\na belief that this flattery must be reasonable to be effective. It is\r\nto the credit of men that few attempt to settle the question by\r\nexperiment, and it is for their happiness, perhaps, that accident has\r\nnever settled it for them. Nevertheless, that a male dissembler who by\r\ndeluging her with untenable fictions charms the female wisely, may\r\nacquire powers reaching to the extremity of perdition, is a truth\r\ntaught to many by unsought and wringing occurrences. And some profess\r\nto have attained to the same knowledge by experiment as aforesaid, and\r\njauntily continue their indulgence in such experiments with terrible\r\neffect. Sergeant Troy was one.\r\n\r\nHe had been known to observe casually that in dealing with womankind\r\nthe only alternative to flattery was cursing and swearing. There was no\r\nthird method. \u201CTreat them fairly, and you are a lost man.\u201D he would\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nThis person\u2019s public appearance in Weatherbury promptly followed his\r\narrival there. A week or two after the shearing, Bathsheba, feeling a\r\nnameless relief of spirits on account of Boldwood\u2019s absence, approached\r\nher hayfields and looked over the hedge towards the haymakers. They\r\nconsisted in about equal proportions of gnarled and flexuous forms, the\r\nformer being the men, the latter the women, who wore tilt bonnets\r\ncovered with nankeen, which hung in a curtain upon their shoulders.\r\nCoggan and Mark Clark were mowing in a less forward meadow, Clark\r\nhumming a tune to the strokes of his scythe, to which Jan made no\r\nattempt to keep time with his. In the first mead they were already\r\nloading hay, the women raking it into cocks and windrows, and the men\r\ntossing it upon the waggon.\r\n\r\nFrom behind the waggon a bright scarlet spot emerged, and went on\r\nloading unconcernedly with the rest. It was the gallant sergeant, who\r\nhad come haymaking for pleasure; and nobody could deny that he was\r\ndoing the mistress of the farm real knight-service by this voluntary\r\ncontribution of his labour at a busy time.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had entered the field Troy saw her, and sticking his\r\npitchfork into the ground and picking up his crop or cane, he came\r\nforward. Bathsheba blushed with half-angry embarrassment, and adjusted\r\nher eyes as well as her feet to the direct line of her path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\nSCENE ON THE VERGE OF THE HAY-MEAD\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, Miss Everdene!\u201D said the sergeant, touching his diminutive cap.\r\n\u201CLittle did I think it was you I was speaking to the other night. And\r\nyet, if I had reflected, the \u2018Queen of the Corn-market\u2019 (truth is truth\r\nat any hour of the day or night, and I heard you so named in\r\nCasterbridge yesterday), the \u2018Queen of the Corn-market.\u2019 I say, could\r\nbe no other woman. I step across now to beg your forgiveness a thousand\r\ntimes for having been led by my feelings to express myself too strongly\r\nfor a stranger. To be sure I am no stranger to the place\u2014I am Sergeant\r\nTroy, as I told you, and I have assisted your uncle in these fields no\r\nend of times when I was a lad. I have been doing the same for you\r\nto-day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI suppose I must thank you for that, Sergeant Troy,\u201D said the Queen of\r\nthe Corn-market, in an indifferently grateful tone.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant looked hurt and sad. \u201CIndeed you must not, Miss Everdene,\u201D\r\nhe said. \u201CWhy could you think such a thing necessary?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am glad it is not.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy? if I may ask without offence.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause I don\u2019t much want to thank you for anything.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am afraid I have made a hole with my tongue that my heart will never\r\nmend. O these intolerable times: that ill-luck should follow a man for\r\nhonestly telling a woman she is beautiful! \u2019Twas the most I said\u2014you\r\nmust own that; and the least I could say\u2014that I own myself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is some talk I could do without more easily than money.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed. That remark is a sort of digression.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo. It means that I would rather have your room than your company.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd I would rather have curses from you than kisses from any other\r\nwoman; so I\u2019ll stay here.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba was absolutely speechless. And yet she could not help feeling\r\nthat the assistance he was rendering forbade a harsh repulse.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D continued Troy, \u201CI suppose there is a praise which is rudeness,\r\nand that may be mine. At the same time there is a treatment which is\r\ninjustice, and that may be yours. Because a plain blunt man, who has\r\nnever been taught concealment, speaks out his mind without exactly\r\nintending it, he\u2019s to be snapped off like the son of a sinner.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed there\u2019s no such case between us,\u201D she said, turning away. \u201CI\r\ndon\u2019t allow strangers to be bold and impudent\u2014even in praise of me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh\u2014it is not the fact but the method which offends you,\u201D he said,\r\ncarelessly. \u201CBut I have the sad satisfaction of knowing that my words,\r\nwhether pleasing or offensive, are unmistakably true. Would you have\r\nhad me look at you, and tell my acquaintance that you are quite a\r\ncommon-place woman, to save you the embarrassment of being stared at if\r\nthey come near you? Not I. I couldn\u2019t tell any such ridiculous lie\r\nabout a beauty to encourage a single woman in England in too excessive\r\na modesty.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is all pretence\u2014what you are saying!\u201D exclaimed Bathsheba, laughing\r\nin spite of herself at the sly method. \u201CYou have a rare invention,\r\nSergeant Troy. Why couldn\u2019t you have passed by me that night, and said\r\nnothing?\u2014that was all I meant to reproach you for.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause I wasn\u2019t going to. Half the pleasure of a feeling lies in\r\nbeing able to express it on the spur of the moment, and I let out mine.\r\nIt would have been just the same if you had been the reverse\r\nperson\u2014ugly and old\u2014I should have exclaimed about it in the same way.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow long is it since you have been so afflicted with strong feeling,\r\nthen?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, ever since I was big enough to know loveliness from deformity.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis to be hoped your sense of the difference you speak of doesn\u2019t\r\nstop at faces, but extends to morals as well.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t speak of morals or religion\u2014my own or anybody else\u2019s. Though\r\nperhaps I should have been a very good Christian if you pretty women\r\nhadn\u2019t made me an idolater.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba moved on to hide the irrepressible dimplings of merriment.\r\nTroy followed, whirling his crop.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut\u2014Miss Everdene\u2014you do forgive me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHardly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou say such things.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI said you were beautiful, and I\u2019ll say so still; for, by G\u2014\u2014 so you\r\nare! The most beautiful ever I saw, or may I fall dead this instant!\r\nWhy, upon my \u2014\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t! I won\u2019t listen to you\u2014you are so profane!\u201D she said, in a\r\nrestless state between distress at hearing him and a _penchant_ to hear\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\u201CI again say you are a most fascinating woman. There\u2019s nothing\r\nremarkable in my saying so, is there? I\u2019m sure the fact is evident\r\nenough. Miss Everdene, my opinion may be too forcibly let out to please\r\nyou, and, for the matter of that, too insignificant to convince you,\r\nbut surely it is honest, and why can\u2019t it be excused?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause it\u2014it isn\u2019t a correct one,\u201D she femininely murmured.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, fie\u2014fie! Am I any worse for breaking the third of that Terrible\r\nTen than you for breaking the ninth?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, it doesn\u2019t seem _quite_ true to me that I am fascinating,\u201D she\r\nreplied evasively.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot so to you: then I say with all respect that, if so, it is owing to\r\nyour modesty, Miss Everdene. But surely you must have been told by\r\neverybody of what everybody notices? And you should take their words\r\nfor it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey don\u2019t say so exactly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh yes, they must!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I mean to my face, as you do,\u201D she went on, allowing herself to\r\nbe further lured into a conversation that intention had rigorously\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you know they think so?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo\u2014that is\u2014I certainly have heard Liddy say they do, but\u2014\u201D She paused.\r\n\r\nCapitulation\u2014that was the purport of the simple reply, guarded as it\r\nwas\u2014capitulation, unknown to herself. Never did a fragile tailless\r\nsentence convey a more perfect meaning. The careless sergeant smiled\r\nwithin himself, and probably too the devil smiled from a loop-hole in\r\nTophet, for the moment was the turning-point of a career. Her tone and\r\nmien signified beyond mistake that the seed which was to lift the\r\nfoundation had taken root in the chink: the remainder was a mere\r\nquestion of time and natural changes.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere the truth comes out!\u201D said the soldier, in reply. \u201CNever tell me\r\nthat a young lady can live in a buzz of admiration without knowing\r\nsomething about it. Ah, well, Miss Everdene, you are\u2014pardon my blunt\r\nway\u2014you are rather an injury to our race than otherwise.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow\u2014indeed?\u201D she said, opening her eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, it is true enough. I may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb (an\r\nold country saying, not of much account, but it will do for a rough\r\nsoldier), and so I will speak my mind, regardless of your pleasure, and\r\nwithout hoping or intending to get your pardon. Why, Miss Everdene, it\r\nis in this manner that your good looks may do more harm than good in\r\nthe world.\u201D The sergeant looked down the mead in critical abstraction.\r\n\u201CProbably some one man on an average falls in love with each ordinary\r\nwoman. She can marry him: he is content, and leads a useful life. Such\r\nwomen as you a hundred men always covet\u2014your eyes will bewitch scores\r\non scores into an unavailing fancy for you\u2014you can only marry one of\r\nthat many. Out of these say twenty will endeavour to drown the\r\nbitterness of despised love in drink; twenty more will mope away their\r\nlives without a wish or attempt to make a mark in the world, because\r\nthey have no ambition apart from their attachment to you; twenty\r\nmore\u2014the susceptible person myself possibly among them\u2014will be always\r\ndraggling after you, getting where they may just see you, doing\r\ndesperate things. Men are such constant fools! The rest may try to get\r\nover their passion with more or less success. But all these men will be\r\nsaddened. And not only those ninety-nine men, but the ninety-nine women\r\nthey might have married are saddened with them. There\u2019s my tale. That\u2019s\r\nwhy I say that a woman so charming as yourself, Miss Everdene, is\r\nhardly a blessing to her race.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe handsome sergeant\u2019s features were during this speech as rigid and\r\nstern as John Knox\u2019s in addressing his gay young queen.\r\n\r\nSeeing she made no reply, he said, \u201CDo you read French?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo; I began, but when I got to the verbs, father died,\u201D she said\r\nsimply.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do\u2014when I have an opportunity, which latterly has not been often (my\r\nmother was a Parisienne)\u2014and there\u2019s a proverb they have, _Qui aime\r\nbien, ch\u00E2tie bien_\u2014\u2018He chastens who loves well.\u2019 Do you understand me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D she replied, and there was even a little tremulousness in the\r\nusually cool girl\u2019s voice; \u201Cif you can only fight half as winningly as\r\nyou can talk, you are able to make a pleasure of a bayonet wound!\u201D And\r\nthen poor Bathsheba instantly perceived her slip in making this\r\nadmission: in hastily trying to retrieve it, she went from bad to\r\nworse. \u201CDon\u2019t, however, suppose that _I_ derive any pleasure from what\r\nyou tell me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI know you do not\u2014I know it perfectly,\u201D said Troy, with much hearty\r\nconviction on the exterior of his face: and altering the expression to\r\nmoodiness; \u201Cwhen a dozen men are ready to speak tenderly to you, and\r\ngive the admiration you deserve without adding the warning you need, it\r\nstands to reason that my poor rough-and-ready mixture of praise and\r\nblame cannot convey much pleasure. Fool as I may be, I am not so\r\nconceited as to suppose that!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI think you\u2014are conceited, nevertheless,\u201D said Bathsheba, looking\r\naskance at a reed she was fitfully pulling with one hand, having lately\r\ngrown feverish under the soldier\u2019s system of procedure\u2014not because the\r\nnature of his cajolery was entirely unperceived, but because its vigour\r\nwas overwhelming.\r\n\r\n\u201CI would not own it to anybody else\u2014nor do I exactly to you. Still,\r\nthere might have been some self-conceit in my foolish supposition the\r\nother night. I knew that what I said in admiration might be an opinion\r\ntoo often forced upon you to give any pleasure, but I certainly did\r\nthink that the kindness of your nature might prevent you judging an\r\nuncontrolled tongue harshly\u2014which you have done\u2014and thinking badly of\r\nme and wounding me this morning, when I am working hard to save your\r\nhay.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, you need not think more of that: perhaps you did not mean to be\r\nrude to me by speaking out your mind: indeed, I believe you did not,\u201D\r\nsaid the shrewd woman, in painfully innocent earnest. \u201CAnd I thank you\r\nfor giving help here. But\u2014but mind you don\u2019t speak to me again in that\r\nway, or in any other, unless I speak to you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Miss Bathsheba! That is too hard!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, it isn\u2019t. Why is it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou will never speak to me; for I shall not be here long. I am soon\r\ngoing back again to the miserable monotony of drill\u2014and perhaps our\r\nregiment will be ordered out soon. And yet you take away the one little\r\newe-lamb of pleasure that I have in this dull life of mine. Well,\r\nperhaps generosity is not a woman\u2019s most marked characteristic.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen are you going from here?\u201D she asked, with some interest.\r\n\r\n\u201CIn a month.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut how can it give you pleasure to speak to me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCan you ask Miss Everdene\u2014knowing as you do\u2014what my offence is based\r\non?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you do care so much for a silly trifle of that kind, then, I don\u2019t\r\nmind doing it,\u201D she uncertainly and doubtingly answered. \u201CBut you can\u2019t\r\nreally care for a word from me? you only say so\u2014I think you only say\r\nso.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s unjust\u2014but I won\u2019t repeat the remark. I am too gratified to get\r\nsuch a mark of your friendship at any price to cavil at the tone. I\r\n_do_, Miss Everdene, care for it. You may think a man foolish to want a\r\nmere word\u2014just a good morning. Perhaps he is\u2014I don\u2019t know. But you have\r\nnever been a man looking upon a woman, and that woman yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen you know nothing of what such an experience is like\u2014and Heaven\r\nforbid that you ever should!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNonsense, flatterer! What is it like? I am interested in knowing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPut shortly, it is not being able to think, hear, or look in any\r\ndirection except one without wretchedness, nor there without torture.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, sergeant, it won\u2019t do\u2014you are pretending!\u201D she said, shaking her\r\nhead. \u201CYour words are too dashing to be true.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am not, upon the honour of a soldier.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut _why_ is it so?\u2014Of course I ask for mere pastime.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause you are so distracting\u2014and I am so distracted.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou look like it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am indeed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, you only saw me the other night!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat makes no difference. The lightning works instantaneously. I loved\r\nyou then, at once\u2014as I do now.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba surveyed him curiously, from the feet upward, as high as she\r\nliked to venture her glance, which was not quite so high as his eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou cannot and you don\u2019t,\u201D she said demurely. \u201CThere is no such sudden\r\nfeeling in people. I won\u2019t listen to you any longer. Hear me, I wish I\r\nknew what o\u2019clock it is\u2014I am going\u2014I have wasted too much time here\r\nalready!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe sergeant looked at his watch and told her. \u201CWhat, haven\u2019t you a\r\nwatch, miss?\u201D he inquired.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have not just at present\u2014I am about to get a new one.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo. You shall be given one. Yes\u2014you shall. A gift, Miss Everdene\u2014a\r\ngift.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd before she knew what the young man was intending, a heavy gold\r\nwatch was in her hand.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is an unusually good one for a man like me to possess,\u201D he quietly\r\nsaid. \u201CThat watch has a history. Press the spring and open the back.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe did so.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you see?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA crest and a motto.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA coronet with five points, and beneath, _Cedit amor rebus_\u2014\u2018Love\r\nyields to circumstance.\u2019 It\u2019s the motto of the Earls of Severn. That\r\nwatch belonged to the last lord, and was given to my mother\u2019s husband,\r\na medical man, for his use till I came of age, when it was to be given\r\nto me. It was all the fortune that ever I inherited. That watch has\r\nregulated imperial interests in its time\u2014the stately ceremonial, the\r\ncourtly assignation, pompous travels, and lordly sleeps. Now it is\r\nyours.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut, Sergeant Troy, I cannot take this\u2014I cannot!\u201D she exclaimed, with\r\nround-eyed wonder. \u201CA gold watch! What are you doing? Don\u2019t be such a\r\ndissembler!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe sergeant retreated to avoid receiving back his gift, which she held\r\nout persistently towards him. Bathsheba followed as he retired.\r\n\r\n\u201CKeep it\u2014do, Miss Everdene\u2014keep it!\u201D said the erratic child of impulse.\r\n\u201CThe fact of your possessing it makes it worth ten times as much to me.\r\nA more plebeian one will answer my purpose just as well, and the\r\npleasure of knowing whose heart my old one beats against\u2014well, I won\u2019t\r\nspeak of that. It is in far worthier hands than ever it has been in\r\nbefore.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut indeed I can\u2019t have it!\u201D she said, in a perfect simmer of\r\ndistress. \u201COh, how can you do such a thing; that is if you really mean\r\nit! Give me your dead father\u2019s watch, and such a valuable one! You\r\nshould not be so reckless, indeed, Sergeant Troy!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI loved my father: good; but better, I love you more. That\u2019s how I can\r\ndo it,\u201D said the sergeant, with an intonation of such exquisite\r\nfidelity to nature that it was evidently not all acted now. Her beauty,\r\nwhich, whilst it had been quiescent, he had praised in jest, had in its\r\nanimated phases moved him to earnest; and though his seriousness was\r\nless than she imagined, it was probably more than he imagined himself.\r\n\r\nBathsheba was brimming with agitated bewilderment, and she said, in\r\nhalf-suspicious accents of feeling, \u201CCan it be! Oh, how can it be, that\r\nyou care for me, and so suddenly! You have seen so little of me: I may\r\nnot be really so\u2014so nice-looking as I seem to you. Please, do take it;\r\nOh, do! I cannot and will not have it. Believe me, your generosity is\r\ntoo great. I have never done you a single kindness, and why should you\r\nbe so kind to me?\u201D\r\n\r\nA factitious reply had been again upon his lips, but it was again\r\nsuspended, and he looked at her with an arrested eye. The truth was,\r\nthat as she now stood\u2014excited, wild, and honest as the day\u2014her alluring\r\nbeauty bore out so fully the epithets he had bestowed upon it that he\r\nwas quite startled at his temerity in advancing them as false. He said\r\nmechanically, \u201CAh, why?\u201D and continued to look at her.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd my workfolk see me following you about the field, and are\r\nwondering. Oh, this is dreadful!\u201D she went on, unconscious of the\r\ntransmutation she was effecting.\r\n\r\n\u201CI did not quite mean you to accept it at first, for it was my one poor\r\npatent of nobility,\u201D he broke out, bluntly; \u201Cbut, upon my soul, I wish\r\nyou would now. Without any shamming, come! Don\u2019t deny me the happiness\r\nof wearing it for my sake? But you are too lovely even to care to be\r\nkind as others are.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no; don\u2019t say so! I have reasons for reserve which I cannot\r\nexplain.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLet it be, then, let it be,\u201D he said, receiving back the watch at\r\nlast; \u201CI must be leaving you now. And will you speak to me for these\r\nfew weeks of my stay?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed I will. Yet, I don\u2019t know if I will! Oh, why did you come and\r\ndisturb me so!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps in setting a gin, I have caught myself. Such things have\r\nhappened. Well, will you let me work in your fields?\u201D he coaxed.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I suppose so; if it is any pleasure to you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMiss Everdene, I thank you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood-bye!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe sergeant brought his hand to the cap on the slope of his head,\r\nsaluted, and returned to the distant group of haymakers.\r\n\r\nBathsheba could not face the haymakers now. Her heart erratically\r\nflitting hither and thither from perplexed excitement, hot, and almost\r\ntearful, she retreated homeward, murmuring, \u201COh, what have I done! What\r\ndoes it mean! I wish I knew how much of it was true!\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\nHIVING THE BEES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Weatherbury bees were late in their swarming this year. It was in\r\nthe latter part of June, and the day after the interview with Troy in\r\nthe hayfield, that Bathsheba was standing in her garden, watching a\r\nswarm in the air and guessing their probable settling place. Not only\r\nwere they late this year, but unruly. Sometimes throughout a whole\r\nseason all the swarms would alight on the lowest attainable bough\u2014such\r\nas part of a currant-bush or espalier apple-tree; next year they would,\r\nwith just the same unanimity, make straight off to the uppermost member\r\nof some tall, gaunt costard, or quarrenden, and there defy all invaders\r\nwho did not come armed with ladders and staves to take them.\r\n\r\nThis was the case at present. Bathsheba\u2019s eyes, shaded by one hand,\r\nwere following the ascending multitude against the unexplorable stretch\r\nof blue till they ultimately halted by one of the unwieldy trees spoken\r\nof. A process somewhat analogous to that of alleged formations of the\r\nuniverse, time and times ago, was observable. The bustling swarm had\r\nswept the sky in a scattered and uniform haze, which now thickened to a\r\nnebulous centre: this glided on to a bough and grew still denser, till\r\nit formed a solid black spot upon the light.\r\n\r\nThe men and women being all busily engaged in saving the hay\u2014even Liddy\r\nhad left the house for the purpose of lending a hand\u2014Bathsheba resolved\r\nto hive the bees herself, if possible. She had dressed the hive with\r\nherbs and honey, fetched a ladder, brush, and crook, made herself\r\nimpregnable with armour of leather gloves, straw hat, and large gauze\r\nveil\u2014once green but now faded to snuff colour\u2014and ascended a dozen\r\nrungs of the ladder. At once she heard, not ten yards off, a voice that\r\nwas beginning to have a strange power in agitating her.\r\n\r\n\u201CMiss Everdene, let me assist you; you should not attempt such a thing\r\nalone.\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy was just opening the garden gate.\r\n\r\nBathsheba flung down the brush, crook, and empty hive, pulled the skirt\r\nof her dress tightly round her ankles in a tremendous flurry, and as\r\nwell as she could slid down the ladder. By the time she reached the\r\nbottom Troy was there also, and he stooped to pick up the hive.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow fortunate I am to have dropped in at this moment!\u201D exclaimed the\r\nsergeant.\r\n\r\nShe found her voice in a minute. \u201CWhat! and will you shake them in for\r\nme?\u201D she asked, in what, for a defiant girl, was a faltering way;\r\nthough, for a timid girl, it would have seemed a brave way enough.\r\n\r\n\u201CWill I!\u201D said Troy. \u201CWhy, of course I will. How blooming you are\r\nto-day!\u201D Troy flung down his cane and put his foot on the ladder to\r\nascend.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you must have on the veil and gloves, or you\u2019ll be stung\r\nfearfully!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, yes. I must put on the veil and gloves. Will you kindly show me\r\nhow to fix them properly?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you must have the broad-brimmed hat, too, for your cap has no brim\r\nto keep the veil off, and they\u2019d reach your face.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe broad-brimmed hat, too, by all means.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo a whimsical fate ordered that her hat should be taken off\u2014veil and\r\nall attached\u2014and placed upon his head, Troy tossing his own into a\r\ngooseberry bush. Then the veil had to be tied at its lower edge round\r\nhis collar and the gloves put on him.\r\n\r\nHe looked such an extraordinary object in this guise that, flurried as\r\nshe was, she could not avoid laughing outright. It was the removal of\r\nyet another stake from the palisade of cold manners which had kept him\r\noff.\r\n\r\nBathsheba looked on from the ground whilst he was busy sweeping and\r\nshaking the bees from the tree, holding up the hive with the other hand\r\nfor them to fall into. She made use of an unobserved minute whilst his\r\nattention was absorbed in the operation to arrange her plumes a little.\r\nHe came down holding the hive at arm\u2019s length, behind which trailed a\r\ncloud of bees.\r\n\r\n\u201CUpon my life,\u201D said Troy, through the veil, \u201Cholding up this hive\r\nmakes one\u2019s arm ache worse than a week of sword-exercise.\u201D When the\r\nman\u0153uvre was complete he approached her. \u201CWould you be good enough to\r\nuntie me and let me out? I am nearly stifled inside this silk cage.\u201D\r\n\r\nTo hide her embarrassment during the unwonted process of untying the\r\nstring about his neck, she said:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CI have never seen that you spoke of.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe sword-exercise.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! would you like to?\u201D said Troy.\r\n\r\nBathsheba hesitated. She had heard wondrous reports from time to time\r\nby dwellers in Weatherbury, who had by chance sojourned awhile in\r\nCasterbridge, near the barracks, of this strange and glorious\r\nperformance, the sword-exercise. Men and boys who had peeped through\r\nchinks or over walls into the barrack-yard returned with accounts of\r\nits being the most flashing affair conceivable; accoutrements and\r\nweapons glistening like stars\u2014here, there, around\u2014yet all by rule and\r\ncompass. So she said mildly what she felt strongly.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; I should like to see it very much.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd so you shall; you shall see me go through it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo! How?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLet me consider.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot with a walking-stick\u2014I don\u2019t care to see that. It must be a real\r\nsword.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I know; and I have no sword here; but I think I could get one by\r\nthe evening. Now, will you do this?\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy bent over her and murmured some suggestion in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\u201COh no, indeed!\u201D said Bathsheba, blushing. \u201CThank you very much, but I\r\ncouldn\u2019t on any account.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSurely you might? Nobody would know.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, but with a weakened negation. \u201CIf I were to,\u201D she\r\nsaid, \u201CI must bring Liddy too. Might I not?\u201D\r\n\r\nTroy looked far away. \u201CI don\u2019t see why you want to bring her,\u201D he said\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\nAn unconscious look of assent in Bathsheba\u2019s eyes betrayed that\r\nsomething more than his coldness had made her also feel that Liddy\r\nwould be superfluous in the suggested scene. She had felt it, even\r\nwhilst making the proposal.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I won\u2019t bring Liddy\u2014and I\u2019ll come. But only for a very short\r\ntime,\u201D she added; \u201Ca very short time.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt will not take five minutes,\u201D said Troy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\nTHE HOLLOW AMID THE FERNS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hill opposite Bathsheba\u2019s dwelling extended, a mile off, into an\r\nuncultivated tract of land, dotted at this season with tall thickets of\r\nbrake fern, plump and diaphanous from recent rapid growth, and radiant\r\nin hues of clear and untainted green.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\u2019clock this midsummer evening, whilst the bristling ball of\r\ngold in the west still swept the tips of the ferns with its long,\r\nluxuriant rays, a soft brushing-by of garments might have been heard\r\namong them, and Bathsheba appeared in their midst, their soft, feathery\r\narms caressing her up to her shoulders. She paused, turned, went back\r\nover the hill and half-way to her own door, whence she cast a farewell\r\nglance upon the spot she had just left, having resolved not to remain\r\nnear the place after all.\r\n\r\nShe saw a dim spot of artificial red moving round the shoulder of the\r\nrise. It disappeared on the other side.\r\n\r\nShe waited one minute\u2014two minutes\u2014thought of Troy\u2019s disappointment at\r\nher non-fulfilment of a promised engagement, till she again ran along\r\nthe field, clambered over the bank, and followed the original\r\ndirection. She was now literally trembling and panting at this her\r\ntemerity in such an errant undertaking; her breath came and went\r\nquickly, and her eyes shone with an infrequent light. Yet go she must.\r\nShe reached the verge of a pit in the middle of the ferns. Troy stood\r\nin the bottom, looking up towards her.\r\n\r\n\u201CI heard you rustling through the fern before I saw you,\u201D he said,\r\ncoming up and giving her his hand to help her down the slope.\r\n\r\nThe pit was a saucer-shaped concave, naturally formed, with a top\r\ndiameter of about thirty feet, and shallow enough to allow the sunshine\r\nto reach their heads. Standing in the centre, the sky overhead was met\r\nby a circular horizon of fern: this grew nearly to the bottom of the\r\nslope and then abruptly ceased. The middle within the belt of verdure\r\nwas floored with a thick flossy carpet of moss and grass intermingled,\r\nso yielding that the foot was half-buried within it.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow,\u201D said Troy, producing the sword, which, as he raised it into the\r\nsunlight, gleamed a sort of greeting, like a living thing, \u201Cfirst, we\r\nhave four right and four left cuts; four right and four left thrusts.\r\nInfantry cuts and guards are more interesting than ours, to my mind;\r\nbut they are not so swashing. They have seven cuts and three thrusts.\r\nSo much as a preliminary. Well, next, our cut one is as if you were\r\nsowing your corn\u2014so.\u201D Bathsheba saw a sort of rainbow, upside down in\r\nthe air, and Troy\u2019s arm was still again. \u201CCut two, as if you were\r\nhedging\u2014so. Three, as if you were reaping\u2014so. Four, as if you were\r\nthreshing\u2014in that way. Then the same on the left. The thrusts are\r\nthese: one, two, three, four, right; one, two, three, four, left.\u201D He\r\nrepeated them. \u201CHave \u2019em again?\u201D he said. \u201COne, two\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nShe hurriedly interrupted: \u201CI\u2019d rather not; though I don\u2019t mind your\r\ntwos and fours; but your ones and threes are terrible!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well. I\u2019ll let you off the ones and threes. Next, cuts, points\r\nand guards altogether.\u201D Troy duly exhibited them. \u201CThen there\u2019s\r\npursuing practice, in this way.\u201D He gave the movements as before.\r\n\u201CThere, those are the stereotyped forms. The infantry have two most\r\ndiabolical upward cuts, which we are too humane to use. Like\r\nthis\u2014three, four.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow murderous and bloodthirsty!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey are rather deathly. Now I\u2019ll be more interesting, and let you see\r\nsome loose play\u2014giving all the cuts and points, infantry and cavalry,\r\nquicker than lightning, and as promiscuously\u2014with just enough rule to\r\nregulate instinct and yet not to fetter it. You are my antagonist, with\r\nthis difference from real warfare, that I shall miss you every time by\r\none hair\u2019s breadth, or perhaps two. Mind you don\u2019t flinch, whatever you\r\ndo.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll be sure not to!\u201D she said invincibly.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to about a yard in front of him.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\u2019s adventurous spirit was beginning to find some grains of\r\nrelish in these highly novel proceedings. She took up her position as\r\ndirected, facing Troy.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow just to learn whether you have pluck enough to let me do what I\r\nwish, I\u2019ll give you a preliminary test.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe flourished the sword by way of introduction number two, and the next\r\nthing of which she was conscious was that the point and blade of the\r\nsword were darting with a gleam towards her left side, just above her\r\nhip; then of their reappearance on her right side, emerging as it were\r\nfrom between her ribs, having apparently passed through her body. The\r\nthird item of consciousness was that of seeing the same sword,\r\nperfectly clean and free from blood held vertically in Troy\u2019s hand (in\r\nthe position technically called \u201Crecover swords\u201D). All was as quick as\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n\u201COh!\u201D she cried out in affright, pressing her hand to her side. \u201CHave\r\nyou run me through?\u2014no, you have not! Whatever have you done!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have not touched you,\u201D said Troy, quietly. \u201CIt was mere sleight of\r\nhand. The sword passed behind you. Now you are not afraid, are you?\r\nBecause if you are I can\u2019t perform. I give my word that I will not only\r\nnot hurt you, but not once touch you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think I am afraid. You are quite sure you will not hurt me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CQuite sure.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs the sword very sharp?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CO no\u2014only stand as still as a statue. Now!\u201D\r\n\r\nIn an instant the atmosphere was transformed to Bathsheba\u2019s eyes. Beams\r\nof light caught from the low sun\u2019s rays, above, around, in front of\r\nher, well-nigh shut out earth and heaven\u2014all emitted in the marvellous\r\nevolutions of Troy\u2019s reflecting blade, which seemed everywhere at once,\r\nand yet nowhere specially. These circling gleams were accompanied by a\r\nkeen rush that was almost a whistling\u2014also springing from all sides of\r\nher at once. In short, she was enclosed in a firmament of light, and of\r\nsharp hisses, resembling a sky-full of meteors close at hand.\r\n\r\nNever since the broadsword became the national weapon had there been\r\nmore dexterity shown in its management than by the hands of Sergeant\r\nTroy, and never had he been in such splendid temper for the performance\r\nas now in the evening sunshine among the ferns with Bathsheba. It may\r\nsafely be asserted with respect to the closeness of his cuts, that had\r\nit been possible for the edge of the sword to leave in the air a\r\npermanent substance wherever it flew past, the space left untouched\r\nwould have been almost a mould of Bathsheba\u2019s figure.\r\n\r\nBehind the luminous streams of this _aurora militaris_, she could see\r\nthe hue of Troy\u2019s sword arm, spread in a scarlet haze over the space\r\ncovered by its motions, like a twanged harpstring, and behind all Troy\r\nhimself, mostly facing her; sometimes, to show the rear cuts, half\r\nturned away, his eye nevertheless always keenly measuring her breadth\r\nand outline, and his lips tightly closed in sustained effort. Next, his\r\nmovements lapsed slower, and she could see them individually. The\r\nhissing of the sword had ceased, and he stopped entirely.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat outer loose lock of hair wants tidying,\u201D he said, before she had\r\nmoved or spoken. \u201CWait: I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201D\r\n\r\nAn arc of silver shone on her right side: the sword had descended. The\r\nlock dropped to the ground.\r\n\r\n\u201CBravely borne!\u201D said Troy. \u201CYou didn\u2019t flinch a shade\u2019s thickness.\r\nWonderful in a woman!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was because I didn\u2019t expect it. Oh, you have spoilt my hair!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COnly once more.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo\u2014no! I am afraid of you\u2014indeed I am!\u201D she cried.\r\n\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t touch you at all\u2014not even your hair. I am only going to kill\r\nthat caterpillar settling on you. Now: still!\u201D\r\n\r\nIt appeared that a caterpillar had come from the fern and chosen the\r\nfront of her bodice as his resting place. She saw the point glisten\r\ntowards her bosom, and seemingly enter it. Bathsheba closed her eyes in\r\nthe full persuasion that she was killed at last. However, feeling just\r\nas usual, she opened them again.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere it is, look,\u201D said the sergeant, holding his sword before her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar was spitted upon its point.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, it is magic!\u201D said Bathsheba, amazed.\r\n\r\n\u201COh no\u2014dexterity. I merely gave point to your bosom where the\r\ncaterpillar was, and instead of running you through checked the\r\nextension a thousandth of an inch short of your surface.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut how could you chop off a curl of my hair with a sword that has no\r\nedge?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo edge! This sword will shave like a razor. Look here.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe touched the palm of his hand with the blade, and then, lifting it,\r\nshowed her a thin shaving of scarf-skin dangling therefrom.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you said before beginning that it was blunt and couldn\u2019t cut me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat was to get you to stand still, and so make sure of your safety.\r\nThe risk of injuring you through your moving was too great not to force\r\nme to tell you a fib to escape it.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe shuddered. \u201CI have been within an inch of my life, and didn\u2019t know\r\nit!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMore precisely speaking, you have been within half an inch of being\r\npared alive two hundred and ninety-five times.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCruel, cruel, \u2019tis of you!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou have been perfectly safe, nevertheless. My sword never errs.\u201D And\r\nTroy returned the weapon to the scabbard.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, overcome by a hundred tumultuous feelings resulting from the\r\nscene, abstractedly sat down on a tuft of heather.\r\n\r\n\u201CI must leave you now,\u201D said Troy, softly. \u201CAnd I\u2019ll venture to take\r\nand keep this in remembrance of you.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe saw him stoop to the grass, pick up the winding lock which he had\r\nsevered from her manifold tresses, twist it round his fingers, unfasten\r\na button in the breast of his coat, and carefully put it inside. She\r\nfelt powerless to withstand or deny him. He was altogether too much for\r\nher, and Bathsheba seemed as one who, facing a reviving wind, finds it\r\nblow so strongly that it stops the breath. He drew near and said, \u201CI\r\nmust be leaving you.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe drew nearer still. A minute later and she saw his scarlet form\r\ndisappear amid the ferny thicket, almost in a flash, like a brand\r\nswiftly waved.\r\n\r\nThat minute\u2019s interval had brought the blood beating into her face, set\r\nher stinging as if aflame to the very hollows of her feet, and enlarged\r\nemotion to a compass which quite swamped thought. It had brought upon\r\nher a stroke resulting, as did that of Moses in Horeb, in a liquid\r\nstream\u2014here a stream of tears. She felt like one who has sinned a great\r\nsin.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance had been the gentle dip of Troy\u2019s mouth downwards upon\r\nher own. He had kissed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\nPARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now see the element of folly distinctly mingling with the many\r\nvarying particulars which made up the character of Bathsheba Everdene.\r\nIt was almost foreign to her intrinsic nature. Introduced as lymph on\r\nthe dart of Eros, it eventually permeated and coloured her whole\r\nconstitution. Bathsheba, though she had too much understanding to be\r\nentirely governed by her womanliness, had too much womanliness to use\r\nher understanding to the best advantage. Perhaps in no minor point does\r\nwoman astonish her helpmate more than in the strange power she\r\npossesses of believing cajoleries that she knows to be false\u2014except,\r\nindeed, in that of being utterly sceptical on strictures that she knows\r\nto be true.\r\n\r\nBathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self-reliant women love when\r\nthey abandon their self-reliance. When a strong woman recklessly throws\r\naway her strength she is worse than a weak woman who has never had any\r\nstrength to throw away. One source of her inadequacy is the novelty of\r\nthe occasion. She has never had practice in making the best of such a\r\ncondition. Weakness is doubly weak by being new.\r\n\r\nBathsheba was not conscious of guile in this matter. Though in one\r\nsense a woman of the world, it was, after all, that world of daylight\r\ncoteries and green carpets wherein cattle form the passing crowd and\r\nwinds the busy hum; where a quiet family of rabbits or hares lives on\r\nthe other side of your party-wall, where your neighbour is everybody in\r\nthe tything, and where calculation is confined to market-days. Of the\r\nfabricated tastes of good fashionable society she knew but little, and\r\nof the formulated self-indulgence of bad, nothing at all. Had her\r\nutmost thoughts in this direction been distinctly worded (and by\r\nherself they never were), they would only have amounted to such a\r\nmatter as that she felt her impulses to be pleasanter guides than her\r\ndiscretion. Her love was entire as a child\u2019s, and though warm as summer\r\nit was fresh as spring. Her culpability lay in her making no attempt to\r\ncontrol feeling by subtle and careful inquiry into consequences. She\r\ncould show others the steep and thorny way, but \u201Creck\u2019d not her own\r\nrede.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd Troy\u2019s deformities lay deep down from a woman\u2019s vision, whilst his\r\nembellishments were upon the very surface; thus contrasting with homely\r\nOak, whose defects were patent to the blindest, and whose virtues were\r\nas metals in a mine.\r\n\r\nThe difference between love and respect was markedly shown in her\r\nconduct. Bathsheba had spoken of her interest in Boldwood with the\r\ngreatest freedom to Liddy, but she had only communed with her own heart\r\nconcerning Troy.\r\n\r\nAll this infatuation Gabriel saw, and was troubled thereby from the\r\ntime of his daily journey a-field to the time of his return, and on to\r\nthe small hours of many a night. That he was not beloved had hitherto\r\nbeen his great sorrow; that Bathsheba was getting into the toils was\r\nnow a sorrow greater than the first, and one which nearly obscured it.\r\nIt was a result which paralleled the oft-quoted observation of\r\nHippocrates concerning physical pains.\r\n\r\nThat is a noble though perhaps an unpromising love which not even the\r\nfear of breeding aversion in the bosom of the one beloved can deter\r\nfrom combating his or her errors. Oak determined to speak to his\r\nmistress. He would base his appeal on what he considered her unfair\r\ntreatment of Farmer Boldwood, now absent from home.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity occurred one evening when she had gone for a short walk\r\nby a path through the neighbouring cornfields. It was dusk when Oak,\r\nwho had not been far a-field that day, took the same path and met her\r\nreturning, quite pensively, as he thought.\r\n\r\nThe wheat was now tall, and the path was narrow; thus the way was quite\r\na sunken groove between the embowing thicket on either side. Two\r\npersons could not walk abreast without damaging the crop, and Oak stood\r\naside to let her pass.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, is it Gabriel?\u201D she said. \u201CYou are taking a walk too. Good-night.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI thought I would come to meet you, as it is rather late,\u201D said Oak,\r\nturning and following at her heels when she had brushed somewhat\r\nquickly by him.\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, indeed, but I am not very fearful.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh no; but there are bad characters about.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI never meet them.\u201D\r\n\r\nNow Oak, with marvellous ingenuity, had been going to introduce the\r\ngallant sergeant through the channel of \u201Cbad characters.\u201D But all at\r\nonce the scheme broke down, it suddenly occurring to him that this was\r\nrather a clumsy way, and too barefaced to begin with. He tried another\r\npreamble.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd as the man who would naturally come to meet you is away from home,\r\ntoo\u2014I mean Farmer Boldwood\u2014why, thinks I, I\u2019ll go,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, yes.\u201D She walked on without turning her head, and for many steps\r\nnothing further was heard from her quarter than the rustle of her dress\r\nagainst the heavy corn-ears. Then she resumed rather tartly\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t quite understand what you meant by saying that Mr. Boldwood\r\nwould naturally come to meet me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI meant on account of the wedding which they say is likely to take\r\nplace between you and him, miss. Forgive my speaking plainly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey say what is not true.\u201D she returned quickly. \u201CNo marriage is\r\nlikely to take place between us.\u201D\r\n\r\nGabriel now put forth his unobscured opinion, for the moment had come.\r\n\u201CWell, Miss Everdene,\u201D he said, \u201Cputting aside what people say, I never\r\nin my life saw any courting if his is not a courting of you.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba would probably have terminated the conversation there and\r\nthen by flatly forbidding the subject, had not her conscious weakness\r\nof position allured her to palter and argue in endeavours to better it.\r\n\r\n\u201CSince this subject has been mentioned,\u201D she said very emphatically, \u201CI\r\nam glad of the opportunity of clearing up a mistake which is very\r\ncommon and very provoking. I didn\u2019t definitely promise Mr. Boldwood\r\nanything. I have never cared for him. I respect him, and he has urged\r\nme to marry him. But I have given him no distinct answer. As soon as he\r\nreturns I shall do so; and the answer will be that I cannot think of\r\nmarrying him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPeople are full of mistakes, seemingly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey are.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe other day they said you were trifling with him, and you almost\r\nproved that you were not; lately they have said that you be not, and\r\nyou straightway begin to show\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat I am, I suppose you mean.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I hope they speak the truth.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey do, but wrongly applied. I don\u2019t trifle with him; but then, I\r\nhave nothing to do with him.\u201D\r\n\r\nOak was unfortunately led on to speak of Boldwood\u2019s rival in a wrong\r\ntone to her after all. \u201CI wish you had never met that young Sergeant\r\nTroy, miss,\u201D he sighed.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\u2019s steps became faintly spasmodic. \u201CWhy?\u201D she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is not good enough for \u2019ee.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDid any one tell you to speak to me like this?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNobody at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen it appears to me that Sergeant Troy does not concern us here,\u201D\r\nshe said, intractably. \u201CYet I must say that Sergeant Troy is an\r\neducated man, and quite worthy of any woman. He is well born.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHis being higher in learning and birth than the ruck o\u2019 soldiers is\r\nanything but a proof of his worth. It show\u2019s his course to be\r\ndown\u2019ard.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot see what this has to do with our conversation. Mr. Troy\u2019s\r\ncourse is not by any means downward; and his superiority _is_ a proof\r\nof his worth!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI believe him to have no conscience at all. And I cannot help begging\r\nyou, miss, to have nothing to do with him. Listen to me this once\u2014only\r\nthis once! I don\u2019t say he\u2019s such a bad man as I have fancied\u2014I pray to\r\nGod he is not. But since we don\u2019t exactly know what he is, why not\r\nbehave as if he _might_ be bad, simply for your own safety? Don\u2019t trust\r\nhim, mistress; I ask you not to trust him so.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, pray?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI like soldiers, but this one I do not like,\u201D he said, sturdily. \u201CHis\r\ncleverness in his calling may have tempted him astray, and what is\r\nmirth to the neighbours is ruin to the woman. When he tries to talk to\r\n\u2019ee again, why not turn away with a short \u2018Good day\u2019; and when you see\r\nhim coming one way, turn the other. When he says anything laughable,\r\nfail to see the point and don\u2019t smile, and speak of him before those\r\nwho will report your talk as \u2018that fantastical man,\u2019 or \u2018that Sergeant\r\nWhat\u2019s-his-name.\u2019 \u2018That man of a family that has come to the dogs.\u2019\r\nDon\u2019t be unmannerly towards en, but harmless-uncivil, and so get rid of\r\nthe man.\u201D\r\n\r\nNo Christmas robin detained by a window-pane ever pulsed as did\r\nBathsheba now.\r\n\r\n\u201CI say\u2014I say again\u2014that it doesn\u2019t become you to talk about him. Why he\r\nshould be mentioned passes me quite!\u201D she exclaimed desperately. \u201CI\r\nknow this, th-th-that he is a thoroughly conscientious man\u2014blunt\r\nsometimes even to rudeness\u2014but always speaking his mind about you plain\r\nto your face!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is as good as anybody in this parish! He is very particular, too,\r\nabout going to church\u2014yes, he is!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am afeard nobody saw him there. I never did, certainly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe reason of that is,\u201D she said eagerly, \u201Cthat he goes in privately\r\nby the old tower door, just when the service commences, and sits at the\r\nback of the gallery. He told me so.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis supreme instance of Troy\u2019s goodness fell upon Gabriel ears like\r\nthe thirteenth stroke of crazy clock. It was not only received with\r\nutter incredulity as regarded itself, but threw a doubt on all the\r\nassurances that had preceded it.\r\n\r\nOak was grieved to find how entirely she trusted him. He brimmed with\r\ndeep feeling as he replied in a steady voice, the steadiness of which\r\nwas spoilt by the palpableness of his great effort to keep it so:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CYou know, mistress, that I love you, and shall love you always. I only\r\nmention this to bring to your mind that at any rate I would wish to do\r\nyou no harm: beyond that I put it aside. I have lost in the race for\r\nmoney and good things, and I am not such a fool as to pretend to \u2019ee\r\nnow I am poor, and you have got altogether above me. But Bathsheba,\r\ndear mistress, this I beg you to consider\u2014that, both to keep yourself\r\nwell honoured among the workfolk, and in common generosity to an\r\nhonourable man who loves you as well as I, you should be more discreet\r\nin your bearing towards this soldier.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t!\u201D she exclaimed, in a choking voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre ye not more to me than my own affairs, and even life!\u201D he went on.\r\n\u201CCome, listen to me! I am six years older than you, and Mr. Boldwood is\r\nten years older than I, and consider\u2014I do beg of \u2019ee to consider before\r\nit is too late\u2014how safe you would be in his hands!\u201D\r\n\r\nOak\u2019s allusion to his own love for her lessened, to some extent, her\r\nanger at his interference; but she could not really forgive him for\r\nletting his wish to marry her be eclipsed by his wish to do her good,\r\nany more than for his slighting treatment of Troy.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish you to go elsewhere,\u201D she commanded, a paleness of face\r\ninvisible to the eye being suggested by the trembling words. \u201CDo not\r\nremain on this farm any longer. I don\u2019t want you\u2014I beg you to go!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201D said Oak, calmly. \u201CThis is the second time you have\r\npretended to dismiss me; and what\u2019s the use o\u2019 it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPretended! You shall go, sir\u2014your lecturing I will not hear! I am\r\nmistress here.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGo, indeed\u2014what folly will you say next? Treating me like Dick, Tom\r\nand Harry when you know that a short time ago my position was as good\r\nas yours! Upon my life, Bathsheba, it is too barefaced. You know, too,\r\nthat I can\u2019t go without putting things in such a strait as you wouldn\u2019t\r\nget out of I can\u2019t tell when. Unless, indeed, you\u2019ll promise to have an\r\nunderstanding man as bailiff, or manager, or something. I\u2019ll go at once\r\nif you\u2019ll promise that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI shall have no bailiff; I shall continue to be my own manager,\u201D she\r\nsaid decisively.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well, then; you should be thankful to me for biding. How would\r\nthe farm go on with nobody to mind it but a woman? But mind this, I\r\ndon\u2019t wish \u2019ee to feel you owe me anything. Not I. What I do, I do.\r\nSometimes I say I should be as glad as a bird to leave the place\u2014for\r\ndon\u2019t suppose I\u2019m content to be a nobody. I was made for better things.\r\nHowever, I don\u2019t like to see your concerns going to ruin, as they must\r\nif you keep in this mind.... I hate taking my own measure so plain,\r\nbut, upon my life, your provoking ways make a man say what he wouldn\u2019t\r\ndream of at other times! I own to being rather interfering. But you\r\nknow well enough how it is, and who she is that I like too well, and\r\nfeel too much like a fool about to be civil to her!\u201D\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that she privately and unconsciously respected\r\nhim a little for this grim fidelity, which had been shown in his tone\r\neven more than in his words. At any rate she murmured something to the\r\neffect that he might stay if he wished. She said more distinctly, \u201CWill\r\nyou leave me alone now? I don\u2019t order it as a mistress\u2014I ask it as a\r\nwoman, and I expect you not to be so uncourteous as to refuse.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly I will, Miss Everdene,\u201D said Gabriel, gently. He wondered\r\nthat the request should have come at this moment, for the strife was\r\nover, and they were on a most desolate hill, far from every human\r\nhabitation, and the hour was getting late. He stood still and allowed\r\nher to get far ahead of him till he could only see her form upon the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nA distressing explanation of this anxiety to be rid of him at that\r\npoint now ensued. A figure apparently rose from the earth beside her.\r\nThe shape beyond all doubt was Troy\u2019s. Oak would not be even a possible\r\nlistener, and at once turned back till a good two hundred yards were\r\nbetween the lovers and himself.\r\n\r\nGabriel went home by way of the churchyard. In passing the tower he\r\nthought of what she had said about the sergeant\u2019s virtuous habit of\r\nentering the church unperceived at the beginning of service. Believing\r\nthat the little gallery door alluded to was quite disused, he ascended\r\nthe external flight of steps at the top of which it stood, and examined\r\nit. The pale lustre yet hanging in the north-western heaven was\r\nsufficient to show that a sprig of ivy had grown from the wall across\r\nthe door to a length of more than a foot, delicately tying the panel to\r\nthe stone jamb. It was a decisive proof that the door had not been\r\nopened at least since Troy came back to Weatherbury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\nHOT CHEEKS AND TEARFUL EYES\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later Bathsheba entered her own house. There burnt upon\r\nher face when she met the light of the candles the flush and excitement\r\nwhich were little less than chronic with her now. The farewell words of\r\nTroy, who had accompanied her to the very door, still lingered in her\r\nears. He had bidden her adieu for two days, which were, so he stated,\r\nto be spent at Bath in visiting some friends. He had also kissed her a\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to Bathsheba to explain here a little fact which did\r\nnot come to light till a long time afterwards: that Troy\u2019s presentation\r\nof himself so aptly at the roadside this evening was not by any\r\ndistinctly preconcerted arrangement. He had hinted\u2014she had forbidden;\r\nand it was only on the chance of his still coming that she had\r\ndismissed Oak, fearing a meeting between them just then.\r\n\r\nShe now sank down into a chair, wild and perturbed by all these new and\r\nfevering sequences. Then she jumped up with a manner of decision, and\r\nfetched her desk from a side table.\r\n\r\nIn three minutes, without pause or modification, she had written a\r\nletter to Boldwood, at his address beyond Casterbridge, saying mildly\r\nbut firmly that she had well considered the whole subject he had\r\nbrought before her and kindly given her time to decide upon; that her\r\nfinal decision was that she could not marry him. She had expressed to\r\nOak an intention to wait till Boldwood came home before communicating\r\nto him her conclusive reply. But Bathsheba found that she could not\r\nwait.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to send this letter till the next day; yet to quell\r\nher uneasiness by getting it out of her hands, and so, as it were,\r\nsetting the act in motion at once, she arose to take it to any one of\r\nthe women who might be in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nShe paused in the passage. A dialogue was going on in the kitchen, and\r\nBathsheba and Troy were the subject of it.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf he marry her, she\u2019ll gie up farming.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Twill be a gallant life, but may bring some trouble between the\r\nmirth\u2014so say I.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I wish I had half such a husband.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba had too much sense to mind seriously what her servitors said\r\nabout her; but too much womanly redundance of speech to leave alone\r\nwhat was said till it died the natural death of unminded things. She\r\nburst in upon them.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho are you speaking of?\u201D she asked.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause before anybody replied. At last Liddy said frankly,\r\n\u201CWhat was passing was a bit of a word about yourself, miss.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI thought so! Maryann and Liddy and Temperance\u2014now I forbid you to\r\nsuppose such things. You know I don\u2019t care the least for Mr. Troy\u2014not\r\nI. Everybody knows how much I hate him.\u2014Yes,\u201D repeated the froward\r\nyoung person, \u201C_hate_ him!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe know you do, miss,\u201D said Liddy; \u201Cand so do we all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI hate him too,\u201D said Maryann.\r\n\r\n\u201CMaryann\u2014Oh you perjured woman! How can you speak that wicked story!\u201D\r\nsaid Bathsheba, excitedly. \u201CYou admired him from your heart only this\r\nmorning in the very world, you did. Yes, Maryann, you know it!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, miss, but so did you. He is a wild scamp now, and you are right\r\nto hate him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s _not_ a wild scamp! How dare you to my face! I have no right to\r\nhate him, nor you, nor anybody. But I am a silly woman! What is it to\r\nme what he is? You know it is nothing. I don\u2019t care for him; I don\u2019t\r\nmean to defend his good name, not I. Mind this, if any of you say a\r\nword against him you\u2019ll be dismissed instantly!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe flung down the letter and surged back into the parlour, with a big\r\nheart and tearful eyes, Liddy following her.\r\n\r\n\u201COh miss!\u201D said mild Liddy, looking pitifully into Bathsheba\u2019s face. \u201CI\r\nam sorry we mistook you so! I did think you cared for him; but I see\r\nyou don\u2019t now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShut the door, Liddy.\u201D\r\n\r\nLiddy closed the door, and went on: \u201CPeople always say such foolery,\r\nmiss. I\u2019ll make answer hencefor\u2019ard, \u2018Of course a lady like Miss\r\nEverdene can\u2019t love him\u2019; I\u2019ll say it out in plain black and white.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba burst out: \u201CO Liddy, are you such a simpleton? Can\u2019t you read\r\nriddles? Can\u2019t you see? Are you a woman yourself?\u201D\r\n\r\nLiddy\u2019s clear eyes rounded with wonderment.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes; you must be a blind thing, Liddy!\u201D she said, in reckless\r\nabandonment and grief. \u201COh, I love him to very distraction and misery\r\nand agony! Don\u2019t be frightened at me, though perhaps I am enough to\r\nfrighten any innocent woman. Come closer\u2014closer.\u201D She put her arms\r\nround Liddy\u2019s neck. \u201CI must let it out to somebody; it is wearing me\r\naway! Don\u2019t you yet know enough of me to see through that miserable\r\ndenial of mine? O God, what a lie it was! Heaven and my Love forgive\r\nme. And don\u2019t you know that a woman who loves at all thinks nothing of\r\nperjury when it is balanced against her love? There, go out of the\r\nroom; I want to be quite alone.\u201D\r\n\r\nLiddy went towards the door.\r\n\r\n\u201CLiddy, come here. Solemnly swear to me that he\u2019s not a fast man; that\r\nit is all lies they say about him!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut, miss, how can I say he is not if\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou graceless girl! How can you have the cruel heart to repeat what\r\nthey say? Unfeeling thing that you are.... But _I\u2019ll_ see if you or\r\nanybody else in the village, or town either, dare do such a thing!\u201D She\r\nstarted off, pacing from fireplace to door, and back again.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, miss. I don\u2019t\u2014I know it is not true!\u201D said Liddy, frightened at\r\nBathsheba\u2019s unwonted vehemence.\r\n\r\n\u201CI suppose you only agree with me like that to please me. But, Liddy,\r\nhe _cannot be_ bad, as is said. Do you hear?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, miss, yes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you don\u2019t believe he is?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what to say, miss,\u201D said Liddy, beginning to cry. \u201CIf I\r\nsay No, you don\u2019t believe me; and if I say Yes, you rage at me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSay you don\u2019t believe it\u2014say you don\u2019t!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t believe him to be so bad as they make out.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is not bad at all.... My poor life and heart, how weak I am!\u201D she\r\nmoaned, in a relaxed, desultory way, heedless of Liddy\u2019s presence. \u201COh,\r\nhow I wish I had never seen him! Loving is misery for women always. I\r\nshall never forgive God for making me a woman, and dearly am I\r\nbeginning to pay for the honour of owning a pretty face.\u201D She freshened\r\nand turned to Liddy suddenly. \u201CMind this, Lydia Smallbury, if you\r\nrepeat anywhere a single word of what I have said to you inside this\r\nclosed door, I\u2019ll never trust you, or love you, or have you with me a\r\nmoment longer\u2014not a moment!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t want to repeat anything,\u201D said Liddy, with womanly dignity of\r\na diminutive order; \u201Cbut I don\u2019t wish to stay with you. And, if you\r\nplease, I\u2019ll go at the end of the harvest, or this week, or to-day....\r\nI don\u2019t see that I deserve to be put upon and stormed at for nothing!\u201D\r\nconcluded the small woman, bigly.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no, Liddy; you must stay!\u201D said Bathsheba, dropping from\r\nhaughtiness to entreaty with capricious inconsequence. \u201CYou must not\r\nnotice my being in a taking just now. You are not as a servant\u2014you are\r\na companion to me. Dear, dear\u2014I don\u2019t know what I am doing since this\r\nmiserable ache of my heart has weighted and worn upon me so! What shall\r\nI come to! I suppose I shall get further and further into troubles. I\r\nwonder sometimes if I am doomed to die in the Union. I am friendless\r\nenough, God knows!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t notice anything, nor will I leave you!\u201D sobbed Liddy,\r\nimpulsively putting up her lips to Bathsheba\u2019s, and kissing her.\r\n\r\nThen Bathsheba kissed Liddy, and all was smooth again.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t often cry, do I, Lidd? but you have made tears come into my\r\neyes,\u201D she said, a smile shining through the moisture. \u201CTry to think\r\nhim a good man, won\u2019t you, dear Liddy?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will, miss, indeed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is a sort of steady man in a wild way, you know. That\u2019s better than\r\nto be as some are, wild in a steady way. I am afraid that\u2019s how I am.\r\nAnd promise me to keep my secret\u2014do, Liddy! And do not let them know\r\nthat I have been crying about him, because it will be dreadful for me,\r\nand no good to him, poor thing!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDeath\u2019s head himself shan\u2019t wring it from me, mistress, if I\u2019ve a mind\r\nto keep anything; and I\u2019ll always be your friend,\u201D replied Liddy,\r\nemphatically, at the same time bringing a few more tears into her own\r\neyes, not from any particular necessity, but from an artistic sense of\r\nmaking herself in keeping with the remainder of the picture, which\r\nseems to influence women at such times. \u201CI think God likes us to be\r\ngood friends, don\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed I do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd, dear miss, you won\u2019t harry me and storm at me, will you? because\r\nyou seem to swell so tall as a lion then, and it frightens me! Do you\r\nknow, I fancy you would be a match for any man when you are in one o\u2019\r\nyour takings.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever! do you?\u201D said Bathsheba, slightly laughing, though somewhat\r\nseriously alarmed by this Amazonian picture of herself. \u201CI hope I am\r\nnot a bold sort of maid\u2014mannish?\u201D she continued with some anxiety.\r\n\r\n\u201COh no, not mannish; but so almighty womanish that \u2019tis getting on that\r\nway sometimes. Ah! miss,\u201D she said, after having drawn her breath very\r\nsadly in and sent it very sadly out, \u201CI wish I had half your failing\r\nthat way. \u2019Tis a great protection to a poor maid in these illegit\u2019mate\r\ndays!\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\nBLAME\u2014FURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next evening Bathsheba, with the idea of getting out of the way of\r\nMr. Boldwood in the event of his returning to answer her note in\r\nperson, proceeded to fulfil an engagement made with Liddy some few\r\nhours earlier. Bathsheba\u2019s companion, as a gauge of their\r\nreconciliation, had been granted a week\u2019s holiday to visit her sister,\r\nwho was married to a thriving hurdler and cattle-crib-maker living in a\r\ndelightful labyrinth of hazel copse not far beyond Yalbury. The\r\narrangement was that Miss Everdene should honour them by coming there\r\nfor a day or two to inspect some ingenious contrivances which this man\r\nof the woods had introduced into his wares.\r\n\r\nLeaving her instructions with Gabriel and Maryann, that they were to\r\nsee everything carefully locked up for the night, she went out of the\r\nhouse just at the close of a timely thunder-shower, which had refined\r\nthe air, and daintily bathed the coat of the land, though all beneath\r\nwas dry as ever. Freshness was exhaled in an essence from the varied\r\ncontours of bank and hollow, as if the earth breathed maiden breath;\r\nand the pleased birds were hymning to the scene. Before her, among the\r\nclouds, there was a contrast in the shape of lairs of fierce light\r\nwhich showed themselves in the neighbourhood of a hidden sun, lingering\r\non to the farthest north-west corner of the heavens that this midsummer\r\nseason allowed.\r\n\r\nShe had walked nearly two miles of her journey, watching how the day\r\nwas retreating, and thinking how the time of deeds was quietly melting\r\ninto the time of thought, to give place in its turn to the time of\r\nprayer and sleep, when she beheld advancing over Yalbury hill the very\r\nman she sought so anxiously to elude. Boldwood was stepping on, not\r\nwith that quiet tread of reserved strength which was his customary\r\ngait, in which he always seemed to be balancing two thoughts. His\r\nmanner was stunned and sluggish now.\r\n\r\nBoldwood had for the first time been awakened to woman\u2019s privileges in\r\ntergiversation even when it involves another person\u2019s possible blight.\r\nThat Bathsheba was a firm and positive girl, far less inconsequent than\r\nher fellows, had been the very lung of his hope; for he had held that\r\nthese qualities would lead her to adhere to a straight course for\r\nconsistency\u2019s sake, and accept him, though her fancy might not flood\r\nhim with the iridescent hues of uncritical love. But the argument now\r\ncame back as sorry gleams from a broken mirror. The discovery was no\r\nless a scourge than a surprise.\r\n\r\nHe came on looking upon the ground, and did not see Bathsheba till they\r\nwere less than a stone\u2019s throw apart. He looked up at the sound of her\r\npit-pat, and his changed appearance sufficiently denoted to her the\r\ndepth and strength of the feelings paralyzed by her letter.\r\n\r\n\u201COh; is it you, Mr. Boldwood?\u201D she faltered, a guilty warmth pulsing in\r\nher face.\r\n\r\nThose who have the power of reproaching in silence may find it a means\r\nmore effective than words. There are accents in the eye which are not\r\non the tongue, and more tales come from pale lips than can enter an\r\near. It is both the grandeur and the pain of the remoter moods that\r\nthey avoid the pathway of sound. Boldwood\u2019s look was unanswerable.\r\n\r\nSeeing she turned a little aside, he said, \u201CWhat, are you afraid of\r\nme?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy should you say that?\u201D said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\u201CI fancied you looked so,\u201D said he. \u201CAnd it is most strange, because of\r\nits contrast with my feeling for you.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe regained self-possession, fixed her eyes calmly, and waited.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou know what that feeling is,\u201D continued Boldwood, deliberately. \u201CA\r\nthing strong as death. No dismissal by a hasty letter affects that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish you did not feel so strongly about me,\u201D she murmured. \u201CIt is\r\ngenerous of you, and more than I deserve, but I must not hear it now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHear it? What do you think I have to say, then? I am not to marry you,\r\nand that\u2019s enough. Your letter was excellently plain. I want you to\r\nhear nothing\u2014not I.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba was unable to direct her will into any definite groove for\r\nfreeing herself from this fearfully awkward position. She confusedly\r\nsaid, \u201CGood evening,\u201D and was moving on. Boldwood walked up to her\r\nheavily and dully.\r\n\r\n\u201CBathsheba\u2014darling\u2014is it final indeed?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed it is.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Bathsheba\u2014have pity upon me!\u201D Boldwood burst out. \u201CGod\u2019s sake,\r\nyes\u2014I am come to that low, lowest stage\u2014to ask a woman for pity! Still,\r\nshe is you\u2014she is you.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba commanded herself well. But she could hardly get a clear\r\nvoice for what came instinctively to her lips: \u201CThere is little honour\r\nto the woman in that speech.\u201D It was only whispered, for something\r\nunutterably mournful no less than distressing in this spectacle of a\r\nman showing himself to be so entirely the vane of a passion enervated\r\nthe feminine instinct for punctilios.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am beyond myself about this, and am mad,\u201D he said. \u201CI am no stoic at\r\nall to be supplicating here; but I do supplicate to you. I wish you\r\nknew what is in me of devotion to you; but it is impossible, that. In\r\nbare human mercy to a lonely man, don\u2019t throw me off now!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t throw you off\u2014indeed, how can I? I never had you.\u201D In her\r\nnoon-clear sense that she had never loved him she forgot for a moment\r\nher thoughtless angle on that day in February.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut there was a time when you turned to me, before I thought of you! I\r\ndon\u2019t reproach you, for even now I feel that the ignorant and cold\r\ndarkness that I should have lived in if you had not attracted me by\r\nthat letter\u2014valentine you call it\u2014would have been worse than my\r\nknowledge of you, though it has brought this misery. But, I say, there\r\nwas a time when I knew nothing of you, and cared nothing for you, and\r\nyet you drew me on. And if you say you gave me no encouragement, I\r\ncannot but contradict you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat you call encouragement was the childish game of an idle minute. I\r\nhave bitterly repented of it\u2014ay, bitterly, and in tears. Can you still\r\ngo on reminding me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t accuse you of it\u2014I deplore it. I took for earnest what you\r\ninsist was jest, and now this that I pray to be jest you say is awful,\r\nwretched earnest. Our moods meet at wrong places. I wish your feeling\r\nwas more like mine, or my feeling more like yours! Oh, could I but have\r\nforeseen the torture that trifling trick was going to lead me into, how\r\nI should have cursed you; but only having been able to see it since, I\r\ncannot do that, for I love you too well! But it is weak, idle\r\ndrivelling to go on like this.... Bathsheba, you are the first woman of\r\nany shade or nature that I have ever looked at to love, and it is the\r\nhaving been so near claiming you for my own that makes this denial so\r\nhard to bear. How nearly you promised me! But I don\u2019t speak now to move\r\nyour heart, and make you grieve because of my pain; it is no use, that.\r\nI must bear it; my pain would get no less by paining you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I do pity you\u2014deeply\u2014O, so deeply!\u201D she earnestly said.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo no such thing\u2014do no such thing. Your dear love, Bathsheba, is such\r\na vast thing beside your pity, that the loss of your pity as well as\r\nyour love is no great addition to my sorrow, nor does the gain of your\r\npity make it sensibly less. O sweet\u2014how dearly you spoke to me behind\r\nthe spear-bed at the washing-pool, and in the barn at the shearing, and\r\nthat dearest last time in the evening at your home! Where are your\r\npleasant words all gone\u2014your earnest hope to be able to love me? Where\r\nis your firm conviction that you would get to care for me very much?\r\nReally forgotten?\u2014really?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe checked emotion, looked him quietly and clearly in the face, and\r\nsaid in her low, firm voice, \u201CMr. Boldwood, I promised you nothing.\r\nWould you have had me a woman of clay when you paid me that furthest,\r\nhighest compliment a man can pay a woman\u2014telling her he loves her? I\r\nwas bound to show some feeling, if I would not be a graceless shrew.\r\nYet each of those pleasures was just for the day\u2014the day just for the\r\npleasure. How was I to know that what is a pastime to all other men was\r\ndeath to you? Have reason, do, and think more kindly of me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, never mind arguing\u2014never mind. One thing is sure: you were all\r\nbut mine, and now you are not nearly mine. Everything is changed, and\r\nthat by you alone, remember. You were nothing to me once, and I was\r\ncontented; you are now nothing to me again, and how different the\r\nsecond nothing is from the first! Would to God you had never taken me\r\nup, since it was only to throw me down!\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba, in spite of her mettle, began to feel unmistakable signs\r\nthat she was inherently the weaker vessel. She strove miserably against\r\nthis femininity which would insist upon supplying unbidden emotions in\r\nstronger and stronger current. She had tried to elude agitation by\r\nfixing her mind on the trees, sky, any trivial object before her eyes,\r\nwhilst his reproaches fell, but ingenuity could not save her now.\r\n\r\n\u201CI did not take you up\u2014surely I did not!\u201D she answered as heroically as\r\nshe could. \u201CBut don\u2019t be in this mood with me. I can endure being told\r\nI am in the wrong, if you will only tell it me gently! O sir, will you\r\nnot kindly forgive me, and look at it cheerfully?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCheerfully! Can a man fooled to utter heart-burning find a reason for\r\nbeing merry? If I have lost, how can I be as if I had won? Heavens you\r\nmust be heartless quite! Had I known what a fearfully bitter sweet this\r\nwas to be, how I would have avoided you, and never seen you, and been\r\ndeaf of you. I tell you all this, but what do you care! You don\u2019t\r\ncare.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe returned silent and weak denials to his charges, and swayed her\r\nhead desperately, as if to thrust away the words as they came showering\r\nabout her ears from the lips of the trembling man in the climax of\r\nlife, with his bronzed Roman face and fine frame.\r\n\r\n\u201CDearest, dearest, I am wavering even now between the two opposites of\r\nrecklessly renouncing you, and labouring humbly for you again. Forget\r\nthat you have said No, and let it be as it was! Say, Bathsheba, that\r\nyou only wrote that refusal to me in fun\u2014come, say it to me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt would be untrue, and painful to both of us. You overrate my\r\ncapacity for love. I don\u2019t possess half the warmth of nature you\r\nbelieve me to have. An unprotected childhood in a cold world has beaten\r\ngentleness out of me.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe immediately said with more resentment: \u201CThat may be true, somewhat;\r\nbut ah, Miss Everdene, it won\u2019t do as a reason! You are not the cold\r\nwoman you would have me believe. No, no! It isn\u2019t because you have no\r\nfeeling in you that you don\u2019t love me. You naturally would have me\r\nthink so\u2014you would hide from me that you have a burning heart like\r\nmine. You have love enough, but it is turned into a new channel. I know\r\nwhere.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe swift music of her heart became hubbub now, and she throbbed to\r\nextremity. He was coming to Troy. He did then know what had occurred!\r\nAnd the name fell from his lips the next moment.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy did Troy not leave my treasure alone?\u201D he asked, fiercely. \u201CWhen I\r\nhad no thought of injuring him, why did he force himself upon your\r\nnotice! Before he worried you your inclination was to have me; when\r\nnext I should have come to you your answer would have been Yes. Can you\r\ndeny it\u2014I ask, can you deny it?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe delayed the reply, but was too honest to withhold it. \u201CI cannot,\u201D\r\nshe whispered.\r\n\r\n\u201CI know you cannot. But he stole in in my absence and robbed me. Why\r\ndidn\u2019t he win you away before, when nobody would have been\r\ngrieved?\u2014when nobody would have been set tale-bearing. Now the people\r\nsneer at me\u2014the very hills and sky seem to laugh at me till I blush\r\nshamefully for my folly. I have lost my respect, my good name, my\r\nstanding\u2014lost it, never to get it again. Go and marry your man\u2014go on!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh sir\u2014Mr. Boldwood!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou may as well. I have no further claim upon you. As for me, I had\r\nbetter go somewhere alone, and hide\u2014and pray. I loved a woman once. I\r\nam now ashamed. When I am dead they\u2019ll say, miserable love-sick man\r\nthat he was. Heaven\u2014heaven\u2014if I had got jilted secretly, and the\r\ndishonour not known, and my position kept! But no matter, it is gone,\r\nand the woman not gained. Shame upon him\u2014shame!\u201D\r\n\r\nHis unreasonable anger terrified her, and she glided from him, without\r\nobviously moving, as she said, \u201CI am only a girl\u2014do not speak to me\r\nso!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAll the time you knew\u2014how very well you knew\u2014that your new freak was\r\nmy misery. Dazzled by brass and scarlet\u2014Oh, Bathsheba\u2014this is woman\u2019s\r\nfolly indeed!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe fired up at once. \u201CYou are taking too much upon yourself!\u201D she\r\nsaid, vehemently. \u201CEverybody is upon me\u2014everybody. It is unmanly to\r\nattack a woman so! I have nobody in the world to fight my battles for\r\nme; but no mercy is shown. Yet if a thousand of you sneer and say\r\nthings against me, I _will not_ be put down!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll chatter with him doubtless about me. Say to him, \u2018Boldwood\r\nwould have died for me.\u2019 Yes, and you have given way to him, knowing\r\nhim to be not the man for you. He has kissed you\u2014claimed you as his. Do\r\nyou hear\u2014he has kissed you. Deny it!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe most tragic woman is cowed by a tragic man, and although Boldwood\r\nwas, in vehemence and glow, nearly her own self rendered into another\r\nsex, Bathsheba\u2019s cheek quivered. She gasped, \u201CLeave me, sir\u2014leave me! I\r\nam nothing to you. Let me go on!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDeny that he has kissed you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI shall not.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHa\u2014then he has!\u201D came hoarsely from the farmer.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe has,\u201D she said, slowly, and, in spite of her fear, defiantly. \u201CI am\r\nnot ashamed to speak the truth.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen curse him; and curse him!\u201D said Boldwood, breaking into a\r\nwhispered fury. \u201CWhilst I would have given worlds to touch your hand,\r\nyou have let a rake come in without right or ceremony and\u2014kiss you!\r\nHeaven\u2019s mercy\u2014kiss you!... Ah, a time of his life shall come when he\r\nwill have to repent, and think wretchedly of the pain he has caused\r\nanother man; and then may he ache, and wish, and curse, and yearn\u2014as I\r\ndo now!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t, don\u2019t, oh, don\u2019t pray down evil upon him!\u201D she implored in a\r\nmiserable cry. \u201CAnything but that\u2014anything. Oh, be kind to him, sir,\r\nfor I love him true!\u201D\r\n\r\nBoldwood\u2019s ideas had reached that point of fusion at which outline and\r\nconsistency entirely disappear. The impending night appeared to\r\nconcentrate in his eye. He did not hear her at all now.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll punish him\u2014by my soul, that will I! I\u2019ll meet him, soldier or no,\r\nand I\u2019ll horsewhip the untimely stripling for this reckless theft of my\r\none delight. If he were a hundred men I\u2019d horsewhip him\u2014\u201D He dropped\r\nhis voice suddenly and unnaturally. \u201CBathsheba, sweet, lost coquette,\r\npardon me! I\u2019ve been blaming you, threatening you, behaving like a\r\nchurl to you, when he\u2019s the greatest sinner. He stole your dear heart\r\naway with his unfathomable lies!... It is a fortunate thing for him\r\nthat he\u2019s gone back to his regiment\u2014that he\u2019s away up the country, and\r\nnot here! I hope he may not return here just yet. I pray God he may not\r\ncome into my sight, for I may be tempted beyond myself. Oh, Bathsheba,\r\nkeep him away\u2014yes, keep him away from me!\u201D\r\n\r\nFor a moment Boldwood stood so inertly after this that his soul seemed\r\nto have been entirely exhaled with the breath of his passionate words.\r\nHe turned his face away, and withdrew, and his form was soon covered\r\nover by the twilight as his footsteps mixed in with the low hiss of the\r\nleafy trees.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, who had been standing motionless as a model all this latter\r\ntime, flung her hands to her face, and wildly attempted to ponder on\r\nthe exhibition which had just passed away. Such astounding wells of\r\nfevered feeling in a still man like Mr. Boldwood were incomprehensible,\r\ndreadful. Instead of being a man trained to repression he was\u2014what she\r\nhad seen him.\r\n\r\nThe force of the farmer\u2019s threats lay in their relation to a\r\ncircumstance known at present only to herself: her lover was coming\r\nback to Weatherbury in the course of the very next day or two. Troy had\r\nnot returned to his distant barracks as Boldwood and others supposed,\r\nbut had merely gone to visit some acquaintance in Bath, and had yet a\r\nweek or more remaining to his furlough.\r\n\r\nShe felt wretchedly certain that if he revisited her just at this nick\r\nof time, and came into contact with Boldwood, a fierce quarrel would be\r\nthe consequence. She panted with solicitude when she thought of\r\npossible injury to Troy. The least spark would kindle the farmer\u2019s\r\nswift feelings of rage and jealousy; he would lose his self-mastery as\r\nhe had this evening; Troy\u2019s blitheness might become aggressive; it\r\nmight take the direction of derision, and Boldwood\u2019s anger might then\r\ntake the direction of revenge.\r\n\r\nWith almost a morbid dread of being thought a gushing girl, this\r\nguileless woman too well concealed from the world under a manner of\r\ncarelessness the warm depths of her strong emotions. But now there was\r\nno reserve. In her distraction, instead of advancing further she walked\r\nup and down, beating the air with her fingers, pressing on her brow,\r\nand sobbing brokenly to herself. Then she sat down on a heap of stones\r\nby the wayside to think. There she remained long. Above the dark margin\r\nof the earth appeared foreshores and promontories of coppery cloud,\r\nbounding a green and pellucid expanse in the western sky. Amaranthine\r\nglosses came over them then, and the unresting world wheeled her round\r\nto a contrasting prospect eastward, in the shape of indecisive and\r\npalpitating stars. She gazed upon their silent throes amid the shades\r\nof space, but realised none at all. Her troubled spirit was far away\r\nwith Troy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\nNIGHT\u2014HORSES TRAMPING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe village of Weatherbury was quiet as the graveyard in its midst, and\r\nthe living were lying well-nigh as still as the dead. The church clock\r\nstruck eleven. The air was so empty of other sounds that the whirr of\r\nthe clock-work immediately before the strokes was distinct, and so was\r\nalso the click of the same at their close. The notes flew forth with\r\nthe usual blind obtuseness of inanimate things\u2014flapping and rebounding\r\namong walls, undulating against the scattered clouds, spreading through\r\ntheir interstices into unexplored miles of space.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\u2019s crannied and mouldy halls were to-night occupied only by\r\nMaryann, Liddy being, as was stated, with her sister, whom Bathsheba\r\nhad set out to visit. A few minutes after eleven had struck, Maryann\r\nturned in her bed with a sense of being disturbed. She was totally\r\nunconscious of the nature of the interruption to her sleep. It led to a\r\ndream, and the dream to an awakening, with an uneasy sensation that\r\nsomething had happened. She left her bed and looked out of the window.\r\nThe paddock abutted on this end of the building, and in the paddock she\r\ncould just discern by the uncertain gray a moving figure approaching\r\nthe horse that was feeding there. The figure seized the horse by the\r\nforelock, and led it to the corner of the field. Here she could see\r\nsome object which circumstances proved to be a vehicle, for after a few\r\nminutes spent apparently in harnessing, she heard the trot of the horse\r\ndown the road, mingled with the sound of light wheels.\r\n\r\nTwo varieties only of humanity could have entered the paddock with the\r\nghostlike glide of that mysterious figure. They were a woman and a\r\ngipsy man. A woman was out of the question in such an occupation at\r\nthis hour, and the comer could be no less than a thief, who might\r\nprobably have known the weakness of the household on this particular\r\nnight, and have chosen it on that account for his daring attempt.\r\nMoreover, to raise suspicion to conviction itself, there were gipsies\r\nin Weatherbury Bottom.\r\n\r\nMaryann, who had been afraid to shout in the robber\u2019s presence, having\r\nseen him depart had no fear. She hastily slipped on her clothes,\r\nstumped down the disjointed staircase with its hundred creaks, ran to\r\nCoggan\u2019s, the nearest house, and raised an alarm. Coggan called\r\nGabriel, who now again lodged in his house as at first, and together\r\nthey went to the paddock. Beyond all doubt the horse was gone.\r\n\r\n\u201CHark!\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\nThey listened. Distinct upon the stagnant air came the sounds of a\r\ntrotting horse passing up Longpuddle Lane\u2014just beyond the gipsies\u2019\r\nencampment in Weatherbury Bottom.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s our Dainty\u2014I\u2019ll swear to her step,\u201D said Jan.\r\n\r\n\u201CMighty me! Won\u2019t mis\u2019ess storm and call us stupids when she comes\r\nback!\u201D moaned Maryann. \u201CHow I wish it had happened when she was at\r\nhome, and none of us had been answerable!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe must ride after,\u201D said Gabriel, decisively. \u201CI\u2019ll be responsible to\r\nMiss Everdene for what we do. Yes, we\u2019ll follow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFaith, I don\u2019t see how,\u201D said Coggan. \u201CAll our horses are too heavy\r\nfor that trick except little Poppet, and what\u2019s she between two of\r\nus?\u2014If we only had that pair over the hedge we might do something.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhich pair?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMr. Boldwood\u2019s Tidy and Moll.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen wait here till I come hither again,\u201D said Gabriel. He ran down\r\nthe hill towards Farmer Boldwood\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\u201CFarmer Boldwood is not at home,\u201D said Maryann.\r\n\r\n\u201CAll the better,\u201D said Coggan. \u201CI know what he\u2019s gone for.\u201D\r\n\r\nLess than five minutes brought up Oak again, running at the same pace,\r\nwith two halters dangling from his hand.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere did you find \u2019em?\u201D said Coggan, turning round and leaping upon\r\nthe hedge without waiting for an answer.\r\n\r\n\u201CUnder the eaves. I knew where they were kept,\u201D said Gabriel, following\r\nhim. \u201CCoggan, you can ride bare-backed? there\u2019s no time to look for\r\nsaddles.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLike a hero!\u201D said Jan.\r\n\r\n\u201CMaryann, you go to bed,\u201D Gabriel shouted to her from the top of the\r\nhedge.\r\n\r\nSpringing down into Boldwood\u2019s pastures, each pocketed his halter to\r\nhide it from the horses, who, seeing the men empty-handed, docilely\r\nallowed themselves to be seized by the mane, when the halters were\r\ndexterously slipped on. Having neither bit nor bridle, Oak and Coggan\r\nextemporized the former by passing the rope in each case through the\r\nanimal\u2019s mouth and looping it on the other side. Oak vaulted astride,\r\nand Coggan clambered up by aid of the bank, when they ascended to the\r\ngate and galloped off in the direction taken by Bathsheba\u2019s horse and\r\nthe robber. Whose vehicle the horse had been harnessed to was a matter\r\nof some uncertainty.\r\n\r\nWeatherbury Bottom was reached in three or four minutes. They scanned\r\nthe shady green patch by the roadside. The gipsies were gone.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe villains!\u201D said Gabriel. \u201CWhich way have they gone, I wonder?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CStraight on, as sure as God made little apples,\u201D said Jan.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well; we are better mounted, and must overtake \u2019em\u201D, said Oak.\r\n\u201CNow on at full speed!\u201D\r\n\r\nNo sound of the rider in their van could now be discovered. The\r\nroad-metal grew softer and more clayey as Weatherbury was left behind,\r\nand the late rain had wetted its surface to a somewhat plastic, but not\r\nmuddy state. They came to cross-roads. Coggan suddenly pulled up Moll\r\nand slipped off.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe must try to track \u2019em, since we can\u2019t hear \u2019em,\u201D said Jan, fumbling\r\nin his pockets. He struck a light, and held the match to the ground.\r\nThe rain had been heavier here, and all foot and horse tracks made\r\nprevious to the storm had been abraded and blurred by the drops, and\r\nthey were now so many little scoops of water, which reflected the flame\r\nof the match like eyes. One set of tracks was fresh and had no water in\r\nthem; one pair of ruts was also empty, and not small canals, like the\r\nothers. The footprints forming this recent impression were full of\r\ninformation as to pace; they were in equidistant pairs, three or four\r\nfeet apart, the right and left foot of each pair being exactly opposite\r\none another.\r\n\r\n\u201CStraight on!\u201D Jan exclaimed. \u201CTracks like that mean a stiff gallop. No\r\nwonder we don\u2019t hear him. And the horse is harnessed\u2014look at the ruts.\r\nAy, that\u2019s our mare sure enough!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do you know?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COld Jimmy Harris only shoed her last week, and I\u2019d swear to his make\r\namong ten thousand.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe rest of the gipsies must ha\u2019 gone on earlier, or some other way,\u201D\r\nsaid Oak. \u201CYou saw there were no other tracks?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue.\u201D They rode along silently for a long weary time. Coggan carried\r\nan old pinchbeck repeater which he had inherited from some genius in\r\nhis family; and it now struck one. He lighted another match, and\r\nexamined the ground again.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis a canter now,\u201D he said, throwing away the light. \u201CA twisty,\r\nrickety pace for a gig. The fact is, they over-drove her at starting;\r\nwe shall catch \u2019em yet.\u201D\r\n\r\nAgain they hastened on, and entered Blackmore Vale. Coggan\u2019s watch\r\nstruck one. When they looked again the hoof-marks were so spaced as to\r\nform a sort of zigzag if united, like the lamps along a street.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a trot, I know,\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201COnly a trot now,\u201D said Coggan, cheerfully. \u201CWe shall overtake him in\r\ntime.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey pushed rapidly on for yet two or three miles. \u201CAh! a moment,\u201D said\r\nJan. \u201CLet\u2019s see how she was driven up this hill. \u2019Twill help us.\u201D A\r\nlight was promptly struck upon his gaiters as before, and the\r\nexamination made.\r\n\r\n\u201CHurrah!\u201D said Coggan. \u201CShe walked up here\u2014and well she might. We shall\r\nget them in two miles, for a crown.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey rode three, and listened. No sound was to be heard save a millpond\r\ntrickling hoarsely through a hatch, and suggesting gloomy possibilities\r\nof drowning by jumping in. Gabriel dismounted when they came to a\r\nturning. The tracks were absolutely the only guide as to the direction\r\nthat they now had, and great caution was necessary to avoid confusing\r\nthem with some others which had made their appearance lately.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat does this mean?\u2014though I guess,\u201D said Gabriel, looking up at\r\nCoggan as he moved the match over the ground about the turning. Coggan,\r\nwho, no less than the panting horses, had latterly shown signs of\r\nweariness, again scrutinized the mystic characters. This time only\r\nthree were of the regular horseshoe shape. Every fourth was a dot.\r\n\r\nHe screwed up his face and emitted a long \u201CWhew-w-w!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLame,\u201D said Oak.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes. Dainty is lamed; the near-foot-afore,\u201D said Coggan slowly,\r\nstaring still at the footprints.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll push on,\u201D said Gabriel, remounting his humid steed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the road along its greater part had been as good as any\r\nturnpike-road in the country, it was nominally only a byway. The last\r\nturning had brought them into the high road leading to Bath. Coggan\r\nrecollected himself.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe shall have him now!\u201D he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSherton Turnpike. The keeper of that gate is the sleepiest man between\r\nhere and London\u2014Dan Randall, that\u2019s his name\u2014knowed en for years, when\r\nhe was at Casterbridge gate. Between the lameness and the gate \u2019tis a\r\ndone job.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey now advanced with extreme caution. Nothing was said until, against\r\na shady background of foliage, five white bars were visible, crossing\r\ntheir route a little way ahead.\r\n\r\n\u201CHush\u2014we are almost close!\u201D said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CAmble on upon the grass,\u201D said Coggan.\r\n\r\nThe white bars were blotted out in the midst by a dark shape in front\r\nof them. The silence of this lonely time was pierced by an exclamation\r\nfrom that quarter.\r\n\r\n\u201CHoy-a-hoy! Gate!\u201D\r\n\r\nIt appeared that there had been a previous call which they had not\r\nnoticed, for on their close approach the door of the turnpike-house\r\nopened, and the keeper came out half-dressed, with a candle in his\r\nhand. The rays illumined the whole group.\r\n\r\n\u201CKeep the gate close!\u201D shouted Gabriel. \u201CHe has stolen the horse!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho?\u201D said the turnpike-man.\r\n\r\nGabriel looked at the driver of the gig, and saw a woman\u2014Bathsheba, his\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nOn hearing his voice she had turned her face away from the light.\r\nCoggan had, however, caught sight of her in the meanwhile.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, \u2019tis mistress\u2014I\u2019ll take my oath!\u201D he said, amazed.\r\n\r\nBathsheba it certainly was, and she had by this time done the trick she\r\ncould do so well in crises not of love, namely, mask a surprise by\r\ncoolness of manner.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, Gabriel,\u201D she inquired quietly, \u201Cwhere are you going?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe thought\u2014\u201D began Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am driving to Bath,\u201D she said, taking for her own use the assurance\r\nthat Gabriel lacked. \u201CAn important matter made it necessary for me to\r\ngive up my visit to Liddy, and go off at once. What, then, were you\r\nfollowing me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe thought the horse was stole.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell\u2014what a thing! How very foolish of you not to know that I had\r\ntaken the trap and horse. I could neither wake Maryann nor get into the\r\nhouse, though I hammered for ten minutes against her window-sill.\r\nFortunately, I could get the key of the coach-house, so I troubled no\r\none further. Didn\u2019t you think it might be me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy should we, miss?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps not. Why, those are never Farmer Boldwood\u2019s horses! Goodness\r\nmercy! what have you been doing\u2014bringing trouble upon me in this way?\r\nWhat! mustn\u2019t a lady move an inch from her door without being dogged\r\nlike a thief?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut how was we to know, if you left no account of your doings?\u201D\r\nexpostulated Coggan, \u201Cand ladies don\u2019t drive at these hours, miss, as a\r\njineral rule of society.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI did leave an account\u2014and you would have seen it in the morning. I\r\nwrote in chalk on the coach-house doors that I had come back for the\r\nhorse and gig, and driven off; that I could arouse nobody, and should\r\nreturn soon.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you\u2019ll consider, ma\u2019am, that we couldn\u2019t see that till it got\r\ndaylight.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue,\u201D she said, and though vexed at first she had too much sense to\r\nblame them long or seriously for a devotion to her that was as valuable\r\nas it was rare. She added with a very pretty grace, \u201CWell, I really\r\nthank you heartily for taking all this trouble; but I wish you had\r\nborrowed anybody\u2019s horses but Mr. Boldwood\u2019s.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDainty is lame, miss,\u201D said Coggan. \u201CCan ye go on?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was only a stone in her shoe. I got down and pulled it out a\r\nhundred yards back. I can manage very well, thank you. I shall be in\r\nBath by daylight. Will you now return, please?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe turned her head\u2014the gateman\u2019s candle shimmering upon her quick,\r\nclear eyes as she did so\u2014passed through the gate, and was soon wrapped\r\nin the embowering shades of mysterious summer boughs. Coggan and\r\nGabriel put about their horses, and, fanned by the velvety air of this\r\nJuly night, retraced the road by which they had come.\r\n\r\n\u201CA strange vagary, this of hers, isn\u2019t it, Oak?\u201D said Coggan,\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Gabriel, shortly.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe won\u2019t be in Bath by no daylight!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCoggan, suppose we keep this night\u2019s work as quiet as we can?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am of one and the same mind.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery well. We shall be home by three o\u2019clock or so, and can creep into\r\nthe parish like lambs.\u201D\r\n\r\nBathsheba\u2019s perturbed meditations by the roadside had ultimately\r\nevolved a conclusion that there were only two remedies for the present\r\ndesperate state of affairs. The first was merely to keep Troy away from\r\nWeatherbury till Boldwood\u2019s indignation had cooled; the second to\r\nlisten to Oak\u2019s entreaties, and Boldwood\u2019s denunciations, and give up\r\nTroy altogether.\r\n\r\nAlas! Could she give up this new love\u2014induce him to renounce her by\r\nsaying she did not like him\u2014could no more speak to him, and beg him,\r\nfor her good, to end his furlough in Bath, and see her and Weatherbury\r\nno more?\r\n\r\nIt was a picture full of misery, but for a while she contemplated it\r\nfirmly, allowing herself, nevertheless, as girls will, to dwell upon\r\nthe happy life she would have enjoyed had Troy been Boldwood, and the\r\npath of love the path of duty\u2014inflicting upon herself gratuitous\r\ntortures by imagining him the lover of another woman after forgetting\r\nher; for she had penetrated Troy\u2019s nature so far as to estimate his\r\ntendencies pretty accurately, but unfortunately loved him no less in\r\nthinking that he might soon cease to love her\u2014indeed, considerably\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nShe jumped to her feet. She would see him at once. Yes, she would\r\nimplore him by word of mouth to assist her in this dilemma. A letter to\r\nkeep him away could not reach him in time, even if he should be\r\ndisposed to listen to it.\r\n\r\nWas Bathsheba altogether blind to the obvious fact that the support of\r\na lover\u2019s arms is not of a kind best calculated to assist a resolve to\r\nrenounce him? Or was she sophistically sensible, with a thrill of\r\npleasure, that by adopting this course for getting rid of him she was\r\nensuring a meeting with him, at any rate, once more?\r\n\r\nIt was now dark, and the hour must have been nearly ten. The only way\r\nto accomplish her purpose was to give up her idea of visiting Liddy at\r\nYalbury, return to Weatherbury Farm, put the horse into the gig, and\r\ndrive at once to Bath.
